There are limitations to the standard economic model of supply and demand curves intersecting to reveal the optimal or equilibrium price and quantity of a good. Those limitations, as Austrians are well aware, are due to unrealistic assumptions. But noting that the assumptions are out of this world is not enough, especially if the models are used to explain a world that does not match the assumptions. The application of the simplified models, which indeed reveal important facts about how the economy works, tend to lead many economists astray.

# Increasing Costs to Producers Does Not Increase Prices

A [recent EconTalk episode](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/02/tom*wainwright.html), in which the host Russ Roberts interviews journalist and author Tom Wainwright of the *Economist* on his recent book *[Narconomics](https://www.amazon.com/Narconomics-How-Run-Drug-Cartel/dp/1610395832/?tag=misesinsti-20)*, illustrates how simple Econ 101 logic can be misleading. While the episode is well worth listening to and the discussion is both interesting and informative, a significant portion in the beginning is dedicated to discussing the issue of the price of illegal drugs. Noting an apparent “paradox” and the author’s “fantastic” argument, Roberts and Wainwright embark on and get stuck in a discussion that is fundamentally flawed and therefore may delude listeners.

In his argument, Wainwright notes that the government’s focus on cutting back on the supply of illegal drugs has not affected price as expected. He uses an example of art to illustrate the point, and this is in fact a better example than he probably realized. Here’s his example: If the paint used to produce a painting costs $50 and a certain painting is sold at the price of $1,000,000, then raising the cost of a box of paint by 100 percent to $100 should also double the price of paintings — the next painting should be expected to be sold for $2,000,000. But it does not, the price of this painter’s next painting may still be $1,000,000, or, to reflect the increased cost, $1,000,050.

Ninu ifioroweoro re, Wainwright se afiyesi pe ijoba te jumo lori gige se yin ifikun ogun ti o lodi si ofin ko ti se akoba owo-oja gege bi aan reti.

Sugbon ko ri be, oye tita oloda leeyin oda le si je $1,000,000, abi, lati fi arajo ti igboyele owo, $1,000,050.

The example illustrates the paradox in what is going on in the illegal drug “business” and, specifically, why government’s attempts to affect the supply have not worked. As argued by Wainwright, even partially successful measures to cut back on supply has not increased final prices for consumers (which was partly the stated rationale). This interesting and unexpected result suggests government should instead “invest” in reducing demand for illegal drugs.

Apeere yii se apejuwe oro afinwe ninu ohun ti o n sele lori ogun ti o lodi si ofin “okowo” ati, ni pataki idi ti ijoba se gbiyanu lati nipa lori pipese ti ko fi sise.

Aadun ati airo esi yii daba fun ijoba lati dipo “nawo” lori di dekun ibeere fun awon ogun ti o lodi si ofin.  

The problem with the argument is that it relies on the simple equilibrium analysis in the demand-and-supply models used in Econ 101 courses for university freshmen. And it doesn’t actually apply here. Had the paintings or illegal drugs markets been in equilibrium, there might indeed be a paradox. But this is hardly the case, *especially* in these markets.

Also, in a state of equilibrium costs perfectly reflect social opportunity costs, and “perfect” competition brings price and cost together so that no one is able to make economic profits. In other words, there is no difference between price and cost. There is, consequently, no reason to in this theory distinguish between them temporally or causally — they appear to be determined instantaneously and accurately. This is also how they are treated in various economics models that students learn to “maximize”.

# Price Drives Cost  — Not the Other Way Around

# Owo oja fa Iye owo – Ki n Se o Na Keji 

As we know, however, the real market process is driven by *entrepreneurship* and market actors are not just responsive agents. Entrepreneurs do not live in equilibrium, and they base their business decisions on their own appraisal of the different actions and their imagined outcomes. In this real market, price drives cost  — not the other way around. Indeed, Carl Menger noted that the value of any production good is derived from consumers’ valuation of the consumption goods that it produces, not the other way around. This is also core to for example Mises’s argument about economic calculation.

Gege bi asemo, nionakona, oja ti o je odo ona ni wa *isowo* ati oja olukopa ni o wa ko kan idahunse. Isowo ko gbe ni iwontun-wonsi, ati nwon sig gbe ipinu lori ara won ayewo ti awon ti o yato si sise ati awon riro abajade. Ni oja ti o gidi, iye owo oja wa owo oja – kin se ona idakeji.

Yi je tun mojuto to fun apeere Mises’s iforoweoro nipa aje isiro.

What this means is that entrepreneurs assume (*choose*, even) costs based on the anticipated revenue of their imagined product. The reason an expensive good is produced at high cost is that those high costs can be covered by the anticipated price that it can be sold for. It doesn’t mean that entrepreneurs choose high costs for the fun of it, but that they motivate a certain level of costs based on the anticipated price — and that price is really dependent only on consumer valuation of the final good.

Ohun tu mo si pe ni awon isowo ro (*yan*, ti o ba je) owo  da lori ti ifiojusona wiwole to won fojusona oja. Awon idi ti ohun gbowolori  oja ti o wa ni yi nig a iye owo je pew n g iye owo le ti  wa nib o nipase awon ti ifojuson owo ti ole ti wa ni ta fun.

In imperfect markets, this means there can be high markups that offer entrepreneurs enormous profits. But this is also what lures other entrepreneurs to enter this particular market, so where there are no significant barriers to entry profits will tend to get squeezed until they reach the standard market rate of return. In this process, costs are pushed down but consumer good prices even more so, thereby making consumers the ultimate winners of this process.

Ni oja ti kop e, eyi tun mosi fifi ami to ga le wa ti o fun isowo ni eri to opolopo. Sugbon eyi tun je won ofifa  awon isowo la ti wo inu paato oja, ni bi ti ko ti si Pataki idaduro lati wo in ere le yi si isunpo tit won yoo fi de oja pipe ipele amubo. Ni sise ona yi, owo ni ajakunle sugbon olumulo oja iye be e pelu, nitorina je ki olumulo je alaseyori awon ona na.

So it is not in any sense a paradox that the market price of a box of paint has very little to do with the final price of the painting. The box of paint is traded in the market at a price that partly is derived from the anticipated value of paintings. Similarly, the coca leaves that will eventually end up in a nostril on Wall Street *are valued because the end product is valued.*

Be ni ki n se oro afin we pe oja iye apoti oda kan ni ye kekere se pelu opin iye kikun oda. Awon apoti oda ni ana ninu oja ni o ye ti ni apa kan je yo lati inu ifousona iye ti oda kikun. Jijora, Awon ewe coca ti ni asepari yi o pari si imu ori Wall Street *o lo ye nitoripe opin sise ni iye*.

If government burns half of those fields, this will not lead to a doubling of the final good’s price. Instead, it will increase the costs that need to be covered by producers to make the final good available in consumer markets. As margins are enormous in illegal drug production and distribution, primarily as a result of government repression, producers don’t think twice to continue just like before without changing prices: it only causes a small dent in their income.

In Wainwright’s example, a kilo of cocaine, with a market value of $100,000 when sold in “tiny portions”, is produced from a ton of fresh coca leaf sold at a price of $500. The refined product sells at $1,000 in Columbia, and to “distributors” in the United states for $15–20,000. In this situation, if the fields of some coca farmers are burned, those farmers lose all their revenue while prices of the remaining product could potentially be bid up (assuming some form of market). How much those prices are bid up depends on the [reservation prices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation*price) of existing cocaine producers and the chance of new entrants. It does not cause a proportional ripple effect throughout the supply chain.

Ni Wainwright’s apeere, Kilo cocaine kan, pelu iye oja $100,000 ti a bat a ni “ tinrin ipin”, le pese lati inu ton didan coca ewe ta ni iye $500. Atunda ise ta ni $1,000 ni Columbia, ati lati “ oni pin” ni United states fun $15 – 20,000.

Ko si fa atunda isele ni gbogbo ona supply chain.

This is easy to see if we adopt the Austrian view that pricing of production goods is done “backward” through entrepreneurial bidding aiming for anticipated consumer prices. But using the supply-and-demand schedule for equilibrium prices can produce a fundamentally flawed analysis — even by those who recognize that the assumptions are unrealistic (which Roberts naturally does).

Eyi rorun lati ri ti a ba gba wole awon Austrian oju pe iye awon oja la se “seyin” kaka isewo ipin koko fun afojusi olumulo iye. Sugbon lilo won pese-ati-beere eto fun iwontun-wonsi iye le seda ayederun ofin nomba – papa lati awon ti o damo pe awon riro je aije-ogidi ( ti Robert fi adayeba se).
This is not to say that the prices within the cocaine supply chain are not some form of equilibrium prices. The assumption of partial equilibrium is not what makes the analysis flawed. The error lies in failing to recognize that cost (that is, the existence and shape of supply) is a function of the anticipated price (demand) of the final good.

Eyi kin se lati sope won iye laarin cocaine supply chain ko je awon iwe iwontun-wonsi iye. Awon riro idameji iwontun-wonsi ko le je ki nomba na ni abawon. Awon abawon wa ni kikuna lati damo owo ( eyi tun mosi, iwalaye ati ona ti pipese) je ise afojusi iye (beere) ti opin oja.

From this follows that changes in factor prices are not necessarily reflected in prices of consumer goods, especially in the short term. Rather, they will be reflected in the profit margins of producers, and can thus cause them to change their behavior.
