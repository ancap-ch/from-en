# Introduzione

Nella Dichiarazione Americana dell'Indipendenza, Thomas Jefferson affermò

> queste verità sono evidenti: che tutti gli uomini sono creati uguali; che sono dotati dal loro creatore di diritti inalienabili; che tra questi ci sono la vita, la libertà e la ricerca della felicità: che per garantire questi diritti, i governi sono istituiti tra gli uomini, derivando i loro giusti poteri dal consenso dei governati; che ogni volta che qualsiasi forma di governo diventa distruttore dei suddetti diritti, è il diritto del popolo di alterarlo o abolirlo, ed istituire un nuovo governo, porre le sue fondamenta su tali principi ed organizzare i suoi poteri nella forma che a loro sembrerà piu congrua per la loro sicurezza e felicità. La prudenza infatti imporrà che i governi da lungo tempo stabiliti non debbano essere cambiati per cause lievi e transitorie; e in accordo con ciò tutta l'esperienza ha dimostrato che l'umanità è più disposta a soffrire mentre i mali sono sofferenti, piuttosto che giustamente abolire le forme a cui sono abituati. Ma quando una lunga serie di abusi e usurpazioni che perseguono invariabilmente lo stesso oggetto, mostra un disegno per ridurli sotto il dispotismo assoluto, è nel loro diritto, è loro dovere scacciare tale governo e fornire nuove guardie per la loro futura sicurezza .

Più di 200 anni dopo la Dichiarazione di Indipendenza, sembra opportuno chiedersi se i governi abbiano effettivamente fatto ciò per cui sono stati progettati, o se l'esperienza o la teoria ci hanno fornito motivi per considerare altre guardie forse più efficaci per la nostra futuro sicurezza. Il presente volume intende fornire una risposta a questa domanda fondamentale. Di fatto, questa domanda ha recentemente assunto nuova urgenza in seguito agli eventi dell'11 settembre 2001. I governi dovrebbero proteggerci dal terrorismo. Eppure, qual è stato il ruolo del governo degli Stati Uniti negli attacchi terroristici al World Trade Center e al Pentagono? Il governo degli Stati Uniti ha un budget di "difesa" di miliardi dollari all'anno, una somma pari al budget annuale combinato dei prossimi 24 paesi con maggior spesa nel settore. Impiega una rete mondiale di spie ed informatori. Tuttavia, non è stato in grado di impedire che aerei di linea commerciale venissero dirottati ed utilizzati come missili contro importanti obiettivi civili e militari. Peggio ancora, il governo degli Stati Uniti non solo non è riuscito a prevenire il disastro dell'11 settembre, ma ha effettivamente contribuito alle cause scatenanti di un tale evento. Nel perseguire una politica estera interventista (assumendo la forma di sanzioni economiche, truppe in più di 100 paesi, bombardamenti implacabili, sostegno a regimi dispotici, schierarsi in terre irrisolvibili e dispute etniche, e comunque tentare una gestione politica e militare di intere aree sul globo), il governo ha fornito la vera motivazione per i terroristi stranieri e ha reso gli Stati Uniti il loro obiettivo principale. Inoltre, com'è stato possibile che uomini armati con nient'altro che taglierini abbiano potuto infliggere il terribile danno che hanno fatto? Ovviamente, ciò è stato possibile solo perché il governo proibiva alle compagnie aeree e ai piloti di proteggere la propria proprietà con la forza delle armi, rendendo così ogni linea aerea commerciale vulnerabile e non protetta contro i dirottatori. Una pistola da $ 50 nella cabina di pilotaggio avrebbe potuto fare ciò che $ 400 miliardi nelle mani del governo non erano in grado di fare. E quale fu la lezione tratta da tali fallimenti? In seguito agli eventi, la politica estera americana divenne ancora più aggressivamente interventista e minacciosa. I militari americani hanno rovesciato il governo afghano poichè è stato detto che stesse "ospitando" la mente del terrorista Osama bin Laden. Durante il suddetto fatto, migliaia di civili innocenti sono stati uccisi come "danni collaterali", ma bin Laden non è stato catturato o punito fino ad oggi, quasi due anni dopo gli attacchi. E una volta che un governo statunitense approvato è stato installato in Afghanistan, il governo degli Stati Uniti ha rivolto la sua attenzione a guerre contro altri stati nemici, in particolare l'Iraq con le sue enormi riserve di petrolio. Gli Stati Uniti hanno rifiutato persino di escludere l'impiego di armi nucleari contro i regimi nemici. Senza dubbio, questa politica ha contribuito ad aumentare ulteriormente il numero di reclute nei ranghi di persone disposte a usare la violenza estrema contro gli Stati Uniti come mezzo di guadagno economico. Allo stesso tempo, sul piano nazionale il governo ha usato la crisi che ha favorito per provocare un ulteriore aumento del proprio potere a scapito della libertà delle persone e dei diritti di proprietà. La spesa pubblica, in particolare sulla "difesa", è stata enormemente aumentata e un nuovo dipartimento governativo per la "sicurezza interna" è stato creato. La sicurezza dell'aeroporto è stata rilevata dal governo federale e dai burocrati del governo e sono stati presi provvedimenti decisivi per una sorveglianza completamente elettronica dei cittadini. In verità, quindi, gli eventi attuali invocano un ripensamento sistematico delle questioni di difesa e sicurezza e i rispettivi ruoli di governo, mercato e società di fornirli.

Due delle proposte più ampiamente accettate tra gli economisti politici e filosofi politici sono le seguenti: Primo: ogni "monopolio" è "cattivo" dal punto di vista dei consumatori. Il monopolio qui è inteso nel suo senso classico come un privilegio esclusivo concesso a un singolo produttore di una merce o di un servizio; ad esempio l'assenza di "ingresso libero" in una particolare linea di produzione. In altre parole, solo un'agenzia, A, può produrre un determinato bene, x. Un tale monopolista è "cattivo" per i consumatori perché, protetto dai potenziali nuovi entranti nella sua area di produzione, il prezzo del suo prodotto x sarà più alto e la qualità di x inferiore rispetto a quella altrimenti possibile. Secondo, la produzione della sicurezza deve essere intrapresa dal governo ed è la sua funzione primaria. Qui, la sicurezza è intesa nel senso ampio adottato nella Dichiarazione di Indipendenza: come protezione della vita, della proprietà (libertà) e della ricerca della felicità dalla violenza domestica (crimine) così come dall'aggressione (straniera) esterna (guerra). In conformità con la terminologia generalmente accettata, il governo è definito come monopolio territoriale della legge e dell'ordine (il decisore finale e l'esecutore). Che entrambe le proposizioni siano chiaramente incompatibili ha raramente causato preoccupazione tra economisti e filosofi, e come è possibile notare, la reazione tipica è stata quella di fare eccezione alla prima proposizione piuttosto che alla seconda. The contributors to this volume challenge this “orthodox” view and offer both empirical and theoretical support to the contrary thesis: that it is the second proposition, not the first, which is false and ought to be rejected. As far as empirical—historical—evidence is concerned, proponents of the orthodox view face obvious embarrassment. The recently ended twentieth century was characterized by a level of human rights violations unparalleled in all of human history. In his book Death by Government, Rudolph Rummel estimates some 170 million government-caused deaths in the twentieth century. The historical evidence appears to indicate that, rather than protecting life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness of their citizens, governments must be considered the greatest threat to human security. Proponents of the orthodox view (willing to compromise the first thesis regarding the “evil” of monopoly in order to maintain the second concerning the necessity of state government) cannot entirely ignore this seemingly overwhelming evidence to the contrary. If they wish to rescue from refutation the thesis that government is indispensible for the provision of law and order, they must revise the second thesis. Experience shows that some states are aggressors, not protectors. Thus, if one is not to discard the second thesis altogether, its further specification is required: it is only possible to claim that some states protect. Accordingly, rather than faulting government as such for the dismal security record in particular during the past century, several attempts have been made to explain this record as the result of specific forms of government. Numerous political scientists, including the aforementioned Rummel, have tried to show by various statistical means that it is the absence of democratic government which explains the “anomalies” of the twentieth century. Admittedly, democracies go to war against nondemocratic regimes, but supposedly not against other democracies. Hence, it would seem to follow—and this thesis has in the meantime become part of the American neoconservative folklore—that once the Wilsonian dream of “making the world safe for democracy” has been achieved, eternal peace and security will be accomplished. In a similar vein, political economists such as James Buchanan and the school of “constitutional economics” have suggested that the admittedly miserable record of governments concerning the provision of internal and external security can be systematically improved by means of constitutional reforms aimed at the strict limitation of governmental powers. Both these explanations are scrutinized and rejected in this volume. As for the thesis of the peaceful nature of democracy, several contributors note that, in accordance with military historians such as J.F.C. Fuller and M. Howard, it rests on a rather selective or even erroneous reading of the historical record. Let me mention only two such misreadings. First, how can this thesis account for a seemingly obvious counterexample such as the American War of Southern Independence (the War Between the States) with its until then unparalleled brutality? Answer: by excluding and ignoring it or downplaying its significance. Second, proponents of the peaceful-democracy thesis typically support their claim by classifying traditional monarchies and modern dictatorships as autocratic and nondemocratic and contrasting both to what they classify as genuine “democracies”. Yet historically (and if any grouping must be done at all), it is democracy and dictatorship that should be grouped together. Traditional monarchies only resemble dictatorships superficially. Instead, dictatorships are a regular outgrowth of mass democracy. Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, and Mao were distinctly democratic rulers as compared to the former Emperors of Russia, Germany, Austria, and China. Indeed, Lenin, Stalin, Hitler, and Mao (and almost all of their smaller and lesser known successors) were outspoken in their hatred of everything monarchic and aristocratic. They knew that they owed their rise to democratic mass politics, and they employed democratic politics (elections, referenda, mass rallies, mass media propaganda, etc.) throughout their reign. On the other hand, as for the proposal of constitutional reforms aimed at limiting state power, several contributors to this volume explain that any such attempts must be considered futile and ineffective if and insofar as the interpretation and the enforcement of such limitations is left to government itself or to one of its organs, such as a governmental supreme court. (See more on this below.) More convincing to the contributors of this volume appears a third thesis, advanced by the economist Ludwig von Mises, which may be considered a combination of the above. Mises asserts that in order to fulfill its primary function as a provider of security, a government must satisfy two conditions: it must be democratically organized, and it must permit unlimited secession in principle.

> Whenever the inhabitants of a particular territory, whether it be a single village, a whole district, or a series of adjacent districts, make it known, by a freely conducted plebiscite, that they no longer wish to remain united to the state to which they belong at the time, their wishes are to be respected and complied with. This is the only feasible and effective way of preventing revolutions and international wars. (Ludwig von Mises, *Liberalism* [Irvington-on-Hudson, New York: Foundation for Economic Education, and San Francisco, Calif.: Cobden Press, 1985], p. 109)

One obvious attraction of this thesis is that it can account for the events of the American War of Southern Independence. Thus, until 1861, it was generally taken for granted in the U.S. that a right to secession existed, and that the Union was nothing but a voluntary association of independent states; but when the desire for the unrestricted right to secede was no longer respected, the state turned from protector to aggressor. Mises’s thesis is accorded considerable attention in this volume, and the role of secession as a means for limiting or escaping government depredation is emphasized repeatedly. However, in requiring a protective state to allow unlimited secession from its jurisdiction, Mises’s explanation essentially renders the State a voluntary membership organization with taxes amounting to voluntarily paid (or withheld) membership dues. With an unlimited right to secession even at the level of individual households, the government is no longer a “State”, but a club. Hence, strictly speaking, Mises’s thesis must be considered a rejection of proposition two rather than merely its revision. The contributors to this volume concur with this judgment, not only for empirical reasons but even more so for theoretical ones. Every attempt to explain the dismal performance of governments (States) qua providers of security as inherent in the nature of state-government must begin with a precise definition of state-government (the State). The definition of the State adopted throughout this volume is uncontroversial. It corresponds closely to that proposed by Thomas Hobbes and adopted to this day by countless political philosophers and economists. Briefly, Hobbes argued that in the state of nature, men would constantly be at each others’ throats. *Homo homini lupus est*. Each individual, left to his own devices and provisions, would spend too little on his own defense. Hence, permanent interpersonal warfare would result. The solution to this presumably intolerable situation, according to Hobbes and his followers, is the institution of a State (government). In order to institute peaceful cooperation—security—among themselves, two individuals, A and B, require a third independent party, S, as ultimate judge and peacemaker. However, this third party, S, is not just another individual, and the good provided by S, that of security, is not just another “private” good. Rather, S is a sovereign and has as such two unique powers. On the one hand, S can insist that his subjects, A and B, not seek protection from anyone but him; that is, S is a compulsory territorial monopolist of protection and ultimate decision making (jurisdiction). On the other hand, S can determine unilaterally (without unanimous consent) how much A and B must spend on their own security; that is, S has the power to impose taxes in order to provide security “collectively”. Based on this definition of government as a compulsory territorial monopolist of protection and jurisdiction equipped with the power to tax without unanimous consent, the contributors to this volume argue that, regardless of whether such a government is a monarchy, a democracy, or a dictatorship, any notion of limiting its power and safeguarding individual life, liberty, and property must be deemed illusory. Under monopolistic auspices the price of justice and protection must rise and its quality must fall. A tax-funded protection agency, it is pointed out, is a contradiction in terms: it is an expropriating property protector and can only lead to ever more taxes and less protection. In fact, even if a state limited its activities exclusively to the protection of life, liberty, and property (as a protective state à la Jefferson would do), the further question of how much security to provide would arise. Motivated like everyone else by selfinterest and the disutility of labor, but with the unique power to tax without consent, a government’s answer will always be the same: to maximize expenditures on protection—and almost all of a nation’s wealth can be consumed by the cost of protection—and at the same time to minimize the production of protection. Furthermore, a monopoly of jurisdiction must lead to a deterioration in the quality of justice and protection. If one can appeal only to the State for justice and protection, justice and protection will be distorted in favor of government—constitutions and supreme courts notwithstanding. After all, constitutions and supreme courts are state constitutions and courts, and whatever limitations to government action they might contain is determined by agents of the very same institution. Accordingly, the definitions of life, liberty, and property and their protection will continually be altered and the range of jurisdiction expanded to the state’s advantage. The first person to provide a systematic explanation for the apparent failure of governments as security producers along the above sketched lines was Gustave de Molinari (1818–1912), a prominent Belgian-born French economist, student of JeanBaptiste Say, and teacher of Vilfredo Pareto, and for several decades the editor of the *Journal des Économistes*, the professional journal of the French Economic Association, *the Societé d’Économie Politique*. De Molinari’s central argument was laid out in his article “De la Production de la Securité” of February 1849. The argument is worth quoting because of its theoretical rigor and its seemingly visionary foresight:

> If there is one well-established truth in political economy, it is this: That in all cases, for all commodities that serve to provide for the tangible or intangible needs of consumers, it is in the consumer’s best interest that labor and trade remain free, because the freedom of labor and trade have as their necessary and permanent result the maximum reduction of price. And this: That the interests of the consumer of any commodity whatsoever should always prevail over the interests of the producer. Now in pursuing these principles, one arrives at this rigorous conclusion: That the production of security should, in the interests of the consumers of this intangible commodity, remain subject to the law of free competition. Whence it follows: That no government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity... Either this is logically true, or else the principles on which economic science is based are invalid. (Gustave de Molinari, *Production of Security*, J.H. McCulloch, trans. [New York: Center for Libertarian Studies, 1977], pp. 3–4)

De Molinari then predicted what would happen if the production of security is monopolized:

> If, on the contrary, the consumer is not free to buy security wherever he pleases, you forthwith see open up a large profession dedicated to arbitrariness and bad management. Justice becomes slow and costly, the police vexatious, individual liberty is no longer respected, the price of security is abusively inflated and inequitably apportioned, according to the power and influence of this or that class of consumers. (Molinari, *Production of Security*, pp. 13–14)

Nearly all contributors to this volume pay explicit tribute to Molinari’s pathbreaking theoretical insight. Hence, the present volume is dedicated to the memory of Gustave de Molinari. If Molinari’s explanation of the dismal performance of government as security provider by the nature of government qua compulsory territorial monopolist of law and order is accepted, however, then the question of alternatives arises. Accordingly, the bulk of this volume consists of contributions to this quest for private and voluntary (market-produced) alternatives to the failed and fundamentally flawed system of state-protection. How could and would an alternative system of freely competing security producers work? Based on historical experience and economic logic, how effective are private alternatives such as mercenaries, guerrillas, militias, partisans, and privateers? What are the consequences of the free proliferation of weapons, in particular of nuclear arms? What is the role of ideology and public opinion in defense and war? What type of good is defense, a “private” or a “public” good? Can protective defense be provided by freely competing and financed insurance agencies? How would the “logic” of competitive insurance-protection differ from that of monopolistic state-protection? How can the transition from a system of monopolistic to competitive security production be achieved? What is the role of secession in this process? How can state-free societies—natural orders—possibly defend themselves against state attacks and invasions? These are the central questions addressed and answered in the present volume by an international assembly of contributors from philosophy, economics, history, sociology, and political science.

The contributions to Section One on state-making and warmaking set the stage historically and conceptually. Marco Bassani and Carlo Lottieri locate the topic and theme of the volume in history and the history of political thought. They emphasize the historical modernity of the institution of a State—States have not always existed—and direct particular attention to medieval (feudal) Europe as an example of a “Society without State”, from which valuable insights regarding the present and its possible paths of transformation can be gained. They explain the ideological revolution, associated with such names as Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes, and Rousseau, that supported and led up to the rise of the State. They review the rise of a liberal-libertarian ideological opposition to Statism, associated in particular with the names of Molinari (in the nineteenth century) and Rothbard (in the twentieth). They note the importance of European “realism”, i.e., the “elitist” social theorists such as G. Mosca, V. Pareto, and R. Michels in Italy and Carl Schmitt in Germany, for a correct understanding of the “non-neutral” nature of the State and sovereignty. And they explore the prospects for liberty and protection in the current world torn between a tendency toward political centralization (a One World Order) and an opposite tendency toward decentralization and secession. Murray N. Rothbard (1926–1995), the author of the second contribution to Section One, is the most important twentiethcentury disciple of Molinari. In synthesizing Molinari’s monopoly (or rather antimonopoly) theory with Ludwig von Mises’s neo-Austrian system of free-market economics (praxeology) and natural-law ethics, Rothbard created a grand new anti-Statist theoretical system, of Austro-Libertarianism. As they were by Molinari, most contributors to this volume have been profoundly influenced by Rothbard and his system. In his contribution to this volume, published originally in 1963 and reprinted here with the permission of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, Rothbard introduces the conceptual and terminological distinctions fundamental to all of the following. He clarifies the meaning of property, aggression, crime, selfdefense, punishment, State, peace, war (“just” and “unjust”), revolution, imperialism, neutrality, and isolationism, and he explains the inherently aggressive nature of the State, i.e., the indissoluble link between War-Making and State-Making. The contributions to Section Two focus on the subject of government forms, war, and strategy. Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn (1909–1999), in the last article completed before his death, presents a sweeping portrait of European history and the role of monarchy and Christian kings. In the European-Christian worldview, the king was seen as part of a natural, quasi-familial hierarchical or “vertical” social order: of “God the Father in Heaven, the Holy Father in Rome, the King as the Father of the Fatherland, and the Father as the King in the Family”. He describes the gradual deconstruction of this vertical worldview and its displacement, beginning with the French Revolution and completed with World War I and II, by a “new” egalitarian or “horizontal” outlook incompatible with monarchy and kings. He identifies democracy (majority rule), socialism (international and national), and popular dictatorship as expressions of this new horizontal worldview. Furthermore, he provides ample historical illustration of how the transformation from monarchy to democracy changed the conduct of war from limited warfare to total war. Gerard Radnitzky, in his wide-ranging essay, bolsters Kuehnelt-Leddihn’s case against democracy. Following Anthony de Jasay, Radnitzky begins with a detailed analysis of the economics and politics of majoritarian democracy and refutes as illusory and impossible the claims of constitutional economists such as James Buchanan. A discussion of the thesis “democracies are more peaceful” occupies the center of his chapter. Based on analytical considerations and detailed historical evidence, Radnitzky rejects the thesis.Further, he identifies the thesis “that democracies do not make war with each other” as “a cornerstone of the New World Order crowd” and U.S. imperialism and hegemony. He concludes with a few game-theoretical considerations regarding the possibility of private defense coalitions and some remarks on the likelihood of the decline and demise of the State. Bertrand Lemennicier provides an economic-conceptual and formalistic, game-theoretical explanation of the effects and prospects of government policies and treaties concerning the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. In accordance with standard economic cartel theory, Lemennicier argues that any such agreements are bound to fail due to external and internal pressure. The cartel members cannot lastingly prevent nonmember countries from developing nuclear weapons independently. And within the cartel, each member has a constant incentive to cheat (and sell). Moreover, Lemennicier argues that even if a cartel agreement could be maintained and enforced, this would still be a “bad” idea. The world is made less safe rather than more so when a single country dominates in nuclear possession and enforcement. “The U.S. retains a monopoly on nuclear dissuasion and plays the part of world enforcer, excluding international exchanges for countries seeking nuclear weapons”, writes Lemennicier. “Such a position is costly, and the U.S. has no legitimate claim to such a role”. The contributions to Section Three review the historical record of private alternatives to State defense and warfare. Joseph Stromberg considers the example of professional “standing armies” commanded by aristocratic officers. He looks at the experience with mercenary armies in Renaissance Italy. He discusses the role of a militia in republican theory and practice from ancient Greece and Rome to the United States and Switzerland. Special attention is given to guerrilla warfare. Its essentially defensive nature is explained, and its role in the American Revolution, in the War for Southern Independence, and in the Second Anglo-Boer War is discussed. Based on this evidence, Stromberg suggests as a solution to the problem of defensive protection some combination of voluntary militias (inspired if possible by a unifying ideology or faith) and modern mercenaries (in the form of professional insurance-protection companies), both steeped in the theory and practice of guerrilla warfare. Larry Sechrest opens his contribution with a brief discussion of the nature of the “good” of defense and argues that defense is a distinctly “private” good (while “national defense” is an “imaginary” good). He then applies these theoretical considerations to the subject of naval warfare. In particular, he provides a detailed survey of “privateering” as a form of naval warfare conducted by privately owned ships from the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries. Sechrest explains how privateers operated, the legal customs that grew up around them, and how remarkably effective and profitable they were. Finally, as to why the practice of privateering declined after the nineteenth century, Sechrest argues that this has no technological reasons. To the contrary, privateering died out because it was “too” effective and threatened the jobs of the regular State-navies. Jeffrey Rogers Hummel begins with a discussion of the anthropological preconditions of State formation and the reasons for the historical triumph of States over Stateless societies. He explores the reasons—population size, geography, political decentralization, wealth and technology—for the success of some States and world regions and the failure of others. In particular, Hummel investigates and emphasizes the importance of ideas and ideological convictions, of motivation and morale, in war and defense. Finally, he ponders the ideological requirements of liberating oneself of the “macroparasitism” of one’s own State and the prospects of defending a free territory against the potential aggression of another, foreign State. Hummel expresses considerable optimism regarding the effectiveness of such a defense—because free societies will be wealthier and technologically more advanced than statist societies—but cautions that the maintenance of a free society (rather than a regression to Statism) requires eternal ideological vigilance on the part of the public. The final section, Section Four, is dedicated to the theory of private security production and its various practical applications. In his contribution, Walter Block argues that to claim “that a tax collecting government can legitimately protect its citizens against aggression is to contradict oneself, since such an entity starts off the entire process by doing the very opposite of protecting those under its control”. In support of this claim, Block reviews, analyzes, and refutes the entire panoply of statist arguments: the “prisoner’s dilemma”, the “free rider”, the “externality”, and the “public goods” thesis in favor of “national defense”. Defense, Block explains, is defense of private property and as “private” as private property. Last, he discusses the thesis, popular especially in “public choice” and “constitutional economics” circles, that States are forms of clubs (and clubs forms of States), and he concurs with Joseph Schumpeter’s verdict that this thesis “only proves how far removed this part of the social sciences is from scientific habits of mind”. In my own contribution to this volume, I open with a reconstruction the Hobbesian myth of “collective security” and its empirical and logical refutation. He then proceeds to a detailed analysis of risk, property, and insurance. He comments on the “arbitrariness” of “national” borders, and hence of “national” defense (in contrast to the “natural” borders of private property and the defense of such borders). He provides a comparative analysis of insurance-protection versus State-protection and contrasts the logic of State-warfare to that of freely financed protection agencies. Finally, Hoppe points out that insurance agencies, in contrast to States, will not disarm those they protect, and he addresses the question of how a free and armed society in conjunction with professional protection-insurance agencies would likely go about defending itself against State aggression. Guido Hülsmann, in the final contribution to this volume, deals with secession as a means of establishing a private-property order and assuring effective protection. He discusses the nature of secession and its comparative advantages as compared to other forms of political reform. After examining the conditions that must be met for secession to be successful, Hülsmann turns to a key problem of secessionist movements: defense against the government from which they are seceding. He argues that secessionist defense organizations must themselves be run on the basis of private-property principles to ensure that the political goal of libertarian secession be reached and that its military effectiveness be as high as possible. Though the implications of the arguments made in this volume are radical and sweeping, the principles are quite simple at root. In economics, the contributors seek the consistent application of market theory, not its arbitrary exclusion from whole areas of life, such that it applies also to the delivery of goods and services associated with security and defense. In politics, the contributors seek only the application of the principle Jefferson presented in his Declaration of Independence, that people have the right and duty to throw off governments that are not effecting their safety and find alternatives that provide guards for future security. In both respects, these ideas represent a relatively unexplored application of traditional liberal theory. And yet, given the continued rise of the national-security state in our own time, the future of liberty itself may hinge on our willingness to push these principles to their fullest extent.
