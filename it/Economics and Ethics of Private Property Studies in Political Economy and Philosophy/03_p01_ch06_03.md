### Dal Deposito e Prestito Bancario alla Riserva Frazionaria: l'Involuzione del Credito

Le banche svolgono due compiti strettamente separati, solo uno dei quali è stato considerato finora.[^20] Da un lato, le banche servono come istituzioni di deposito, offrendo servizi di custodia e di compensazione. Accettano depositi di denaro (commodity) ed attribuiscono crediti in denaro (per ricevute magazzino, per sostituti del denaro) ai loro depositanti, riscattabili alla pari e su richiesta. Per ogni richiesta di denaro emessa da loro, detengono una quantità equivalente di denaro genuino disponibile, pronta per la riscossione (100% di riserva bancaria). Nessun interesse è pagato sui depositi. Piuttosto, i depositanti pagano una commissione alla banca per la fornitura di servizi di custodia e di compensazione. In condizioni di ingresso libero e senza concorrenza nel settore bancario, la commissione sul deposito, che costituisce un entrata per una banca e la possibile fonte di profitto, tende ad essere una commissione minima; e gli utili - o meglio, i rendimenti degli interessi - guadagnati nel settore bancario tendono ad essere gli stessi di qualsiasi altra industria non bancaria.

D'altra parte, originariamente interamente distinte istituzionalmente dagli istituti di deposito, le banche fungono anche da intermediari tra risparmiatori e investitori - come banche di prestito. In questa funzione, prima offrono e stipulano contratti a tempo con i risparmiatori. I risparmiatori offrono denaro in prestito alla banca per un periodo di tempo specificato, più breve o più lungo, in cambio dell'obbligo contrattuale delle banche di un futuro rimborso più un ulteriore rendimento di interessi. Dal punto di vista dei risparmiatori, scambiano i soldi presenti per una promessa di denaro futuro: il rendimento degli interessi costituisce la loro ricompensa per svolgere la funzione di attesa. Avendo così acquisito temporaneamente la proprietà dei risparmi dai risparmiatori, la banca quindi presta gli stessi soldi agli investitori (incluso se stessa) in cambio dell'obbligo di futuro rimborso e interesse. Il differenziale di interesse - la differenza tra gli interessi pagati ai risparmiatori e quelli addebitati ai mutuatari - rappresenta il prezzo per l'intermediazione tra risparmiatori e investitori e costituisce il reddito della banca di prestito. Per quanto riguarda i depositi bancari e le commissioni di deposito, in condizioni competitive i costi di intermediazione anche tendono ad essere costi minimi, ed anche i profitti derivanti dal prestito bancario tendono ad essere uguali a quelli che si possono guadagnare altrove.

Né il deposito bancario né il prestito bancario, come qui caratterizzati, comportano un aumento dell'offerta di moneta o una redistribuzione di reddito o ricchezza unilaterale. Per ogni nuova nota di deposito emesso viene tolta dalla circolazione una quantità equivalente di denaro (solo la forma di di denaro cambia, non la sua quantità), e nel corso del prestito bancario la stessa somma di denaro cambia semplicemente le mani ripetutamente. Tutti gli scambi - tra depositanti e istituti depositanti, nonché tra risparmiatori, banca intermedia e investitori - sono reciprocamente vantaggiosi.

Al contrario, l'attività bancaria a riserva frazionaria comporta una deliberata confusione tra la funzione del deposito e quella del prestito. Implica un aumento dell'offerta di moneta, e porta ad una ridistribuzione unilaterale del reddito a favore della banca, nonché ad inefficienze economiche sotto forma di cicli economici boom-bust.

La confusione di entrambe le funzioni bancarie viene alla luce nel fatto che, sotto la riserva frazionaria, i depositanti ricevono interessi (piuttosto che dover pagare una commissione) e / o ai risparmiatori viene concesso il diritto di recesso immediato (piuttosto che dover attendere per la richiesta di rimborso fino ad una specifica data futura). Tecnicamente, la possibilità che una banca si impegni in tali pratiche deriva dal fatto che i detentori di depositi a vista (richieste di denaro riscattabili su richiesta, istantaneamente, alla pari) normalmente *non* esercitano il loro diritto simultaneamente, nel senso che non avvicinano la banca tutti insieme con alla richiesta di rimborso allo stesso tempo. Di conseguenza, una banca depositaria di solito detiene una quantità di riserve (di denaro proprio) in eccesso rispetto ai prelievi giornalieri effettivi. Diventa quindi fattibile per la banca prestare queste riserve "in eccesso" ai mutuatari, ottenendo così alla banca un rendimento di interesse (che la banca poi può in parte trasferire ai suoi depositanti sotto forma di interessi che pagando i conti di deposito).

I proponenti dell'attività bancaria a riserva frazionaria di solito affermano che questa pratica di detenere meno del 100 per cento delle riserve rappresenta semplicemente un innocuo denaro "economizzante", e amano sottolineare che non solo la banca, ma i depositanti (che ricevono interessi) ed i risparmiatori (ricevendo immediatamente diritto di recesso) traggono profitto dalla pratica anche. In effetti, il sistema bancario a riserva frazionaria soffre di due difetti fatali interconnessi ed è tutt'altro che innocuo e benefico. Prima di tutto, va notato che tutto ciò che è meno del 100% di riserva di deposito bancario coinvolge quella che potremmo chiamare un'impossibilità legale, poiché impiegando le sue riserve in eccesso per la concessione di credito, la banca trasferisce effettivamente la proprietà temporanea di tali prestiti a qualche mutuatario, mentre i depositanti, aventi diritto ad un riscatto immediato, mantengono la proprietà sugli stessi fondi. Tuttavia, è impossibile che per qualche tempo il depositante *ed* il mutuatario abbiano il diritto al controllo esclusivo sulle stesse risorse contemporaneamente. Due individui *non possono essere* il proprietario esclusivo di una stessa cosa allo stesso tempo. Di conseguenza, qualsiasi banca che pretenda il contrario - assumendosi la domanda di debito in eccesso rispetto alle riserve effettive - deve essere considerata come agente fraudolento. I suoi obblighi contrattuali *non possono essere* soddisfatti. Fin dall'inizio, la banca deve essere considerata come intrinsecamente fallimentare - come rivelato dal fatto che non potrebbe, contrariamente alla propria presunzione, resistere ad un possibile assalto agli sportelli.

In secondo luogo, prestando le sue riserve in eccesso ai mutuatari, la banca aumenta l'offerta di moneta, indipendentemente dal fatto che i mutuatari ricevano tali riserve sotto forma di denaro vero o di depositi a vista (conti correnti). Se il prestito assume la forma di denaro genuino, allora la quantità di moneta propriamente detta in circolazione viene aumentata senza prelevare una quantità equivalente di sostituti monetari dalla circolazione; e se assume la forma di un conto corrente, la quantità di sostituti monetari viene aumentata senza prelevare una corrispondente quantità di denaro genuino dalla circolazione. In either case, there will be more money in existence now than before, leading to a reduction in the purchasing power of money (inflation) and, in its course, to a systematic redistribution of real income in favor of the bank and its borrower clients and at the expense of the nonbank public and all other bank clients. The bank receives additional interest income while it makes no additional contribution whatsoever to the real wealth of the nonbank public (as would be the case if the interest return were the result of reduced bank spending, i.e., savings); and the borrowers acquire real, nonmonetary assets with their funds, thereby reducing the real wealth of the rest of the public by the same amount.

Moreover, insofar as the bank does not simply spend the excess reserves on its own consumption but instead loans them out against interest charges, invariably a business cycle is set in motion.[^21] The quantity of credit offered is larger than before. As a consequence, the price of credit—the interest charged for loans—will fall below what it otherwise would have been. At a lower price, more credit is taken. Since money cannot breed more money, in order to be able to earn an interest return and a pure profit on top of it, the borrowers will have to convert their borrowed funds into investments. That is, they will have to purchase or rent factors of production—land, labor, and possibly capital goods (produced factors of production)—capable of producing a future output of goods whose value (price) exceeds that of the input. Accordingly with an expanded volume of credit, more presently available resources will be bound up in the production of *future* goods (instead of being used for present consumption) than otherwise would have been; and in order to complete all investment projects now under way, more time will be needed than that required to complete only those that would have been begun without the credit expansion. All the future goods which would have been created without the expansion plus those that are newly added on account of the credit expansion must be produced.

However, in distinct contrast to the situation in which the interest rate falls due to a fall in the rate of time preference (the degree to which present goods are preferred over future goods), and hence where the public has in fact saved more so as to make a larger fund of present goods available to investors in exchange for their promise of a return of future goods, no such change in time preference and savings has taken place in the case under consideration. The public has *not* saved more, and accordingly, the additional amount of credit granted by the bank does not represent *commodity credit* (credit covered by nonmoney goods which the public has abstained from consuming), but it is *fiduciary* or *circulation credit* (credit that has been literally created out of thin air—without any corresponding sacrifice, in the form of nonconsumed nonmoney goods, on the part of the creditor).[^22] Had the additional credit been commodity credit, an expanded volume of investment activities would have been warranted. There would have been a sufficiently large supply of present goods that could be devoted to the production of future goods such that all—the old as well as the newly begun—investment projects could be successfully completed and a higher level of future consumption attained. If the credit expansion is due to the granting of circulation credit, however, the ensuing volume of investment must actually prove overambitious. Misled by a lower interest rate, investors act *as if* savings had increased. They withdraw more of the presently available resources for investment projects, to be converted into future capital goods, than is warranted in light of actual savings. Consequently, capital goods prices will increase initially relative to consumer goods prices, but once the public’s underlying time preference rate begins to reassert itself, a systematic shortage of consumer goods will arise. Accordingly, the interest rate will adjust upward, and it is now consumer goods prices which rise relative to capital goods prices, requiring the liquidation of part of the investment as unsustainable malinvestment. The earlier boom will turn bust, reducing the future standard of living below the level that otherwise could have been reached.

Among recent proponents of fractional reserve banking the cases of Lawrence White and George Selgin[^23] deserve a few critical comments, if for no other reason than that both are critics of Friedmanite monetarism who hark back, instead, to the tradition of Austrian and in particular Misesian monetary theory.[^24] Their monetary ideal is a universal commodity money such as an international gold standard and, based on this, a system of competitive banking which, they claim, would—and should be permitted to do so for reasons of economic efficiency as well as justice—engage in fractional reserve banking and the granting of fiduciary credit.

As to the question of justice, White and Selgin offer but one argument destined to show the allegedly nonfraudulent character of fractional reserves: that outlawing such a practice would involve a violation of the principle of freedom of contract by preventing “banks and their customers from making whatever sorts of contractual arrangements are mutually agreeable”.[^25] Yet this is surely a silly argument. First off, as a matter of historical fact fractional reserve banks never informed their depositors that some or all of their deposits would actually be loaned out and hence could not possibly be ready for redemption at any time. (Even if the bank were to pay interest on deposit accounts, and hence it *should* have been clear that the bank *must* loan out deposits, this does not imply that any of the depositors actually understand this fact. Indeed, it is safe to say that few if any do, even among those who are not economic illiterates.) Nor did fractional reserve banks inform their borrowers that some or all of the credit granted to them had been created out of thin air and was subject to being recalled at any time. How, then, can their practice be called anything but fraud and embezzlement!

Second, and more decisive, to believe that fractional reserve banking should be regarded as falling under and protected by the principle of freedom of contract involves a complete misunderstanding of the very meaning of this principle. Freedom of contract does not imply that *every* mutually advantageous contract should be permitted. Clearly, if A and B contractually agree to rob C, this would not be in accordance with the principle. Freedom of contract means instead that A and B should be allowed to make any contract whatsoever *regarding their own properties*, yet fractional reserve banking involves the making of contracts regarding the property of third parties. Whenever the bank loans its “excess” reserves to a borrower, such a bilateral contract affects the property of third parties in a threefold way. First, by thereby increasing the money supply, the purchasing power of all other money owners is reduced; second, all depositors are harmed because the likelihood of their successfully recovering their own possessions is lowered; and third, all other borrowers—borrowers of commodity credit—are harmed because the injection of fiduciary credit impairs the safety of the entire credit structure and increases the risk of a business failure for every investor of commodity credit.

In order to overcome these objections to the claim that fractional reserve banking accords with the principle of freedom of contract, White and Selgin then, as their last line of defense, withdraw to the position that banks may attach an “option clause” to their notes, informing depositors that the bank may at any time suspend or defer redemption, and letting borrowers know that their loans may be instantly recalled.[^26] While such a practice would indeed dispose of the charge of fraud, it is subject to another fundamental criticism, for such notes would no longer be *money* but a peculiar form of *lottery tickets*.[^27] It is the function of money to serve as the most easily resalable and most widely acceptable good, so as to prepare its owner for instant purchases of directly or indirectly serviceable consumer or producer goods at not yet known future dates; hence, whatever may serve as money so as to be instantly resalable at any future point in time, it must be something that bestows an *absolute* and *unconditional* property right on its owner. In sharp contrast, the owner of a note to which an option clause is attached does *not* possess an unconditional property title. Rather, similar to the holder of a “fractional reserve parking ticket” (where more tickets are sold than there are parking places on hand, and lots are allocated according to a “first-come-firstserved” rule), he is merely entitled to participate in the drawing of certain prizes, consisting of ownership or time-rental services to specified goods according to specified rules. But as drawing rights—and not unconditional ownership titles—they only possess *temporally conditional* value until the time of the drawing, and they become worthless as soon as the prizes have been allocated to the ticket holders; thus, they would be uniquely *un*suited to serve as a medium of exchange.

As regards the second contention: that fractional reserve banking is economically efficient, it is noteworthy to point out that White, although he is undoubtedly familiar with the Austrian-Misesian claim that *any* injection of fiduciary credit must result in a boom-bust cycle, nowhere even mentions the problem of business cycles. Only Selgin addresses the problem. In his attempt to show that fractional reserve banking does not cause business cycles, however, Selgin then falls headlong into the fundamental Keynesian error of confusing the demand for money (determined by the utility of money) and savings (determined by time preference).[^28]

According to Selgin, “to hold inside money is to engage in voluntary saving”; and accordingly “an increase in the demand for money warrants an increase in bank loans and investments” because

> [w]henever a bank expands its liabilities in the process of making new loans and investments, it is the holders of the liabilities who are the ultimate lenders of credit, and what they lend are the real resources they could acquire if, instead of holding money, they spent it.[^29]

Based on this view of the holding of money as representing saving and an increased demand for money as being the same thing as increased saving, then, Selgin goes on to criticize Mises’s claim that *any* issuance of fiduciary media, in lowering the interest rate below its “natural” level, must cause a business cycle as “confused”. “No ill consequences result from the issue of fiduciary media in response to a greater demand for balances of inside money”.[^30]

Yet the confusion is all Selgin’s. First off, it is false to say that the holding of money (the act of not spending it), is equivalent to saving. One might as well say—and this would be equally wrong—that the not-spending of money is equivalent to *not* saving. In fact, saving is not-consuming, and the demand for money has nothing to do with saving or not-saving. The demand for money is the unwillingness to buy or rent nonmoney goods, and these include consumer goods (present goods) *and* capital goods (future goods). Not-spending money is to purchase, *neither* consumer goods *nor* investment goods. Contrary to Selgin, then, matters are as follows: Individuals may employ their monetary assets in one of three ways. They can spend them on consumer goods; they can spend them on investment; or they can keep them in the form of cash. There are no other alternatives. While a person must at all times make decisions regarding three margins at once, invariably the outcome is determined by two distinct and praxeologically unrelated factors. The consumption/investment proportion (the decision of how much of one’s money to spend on consumption and how much on investment) is determined by a person’s time preference (the degree to which he prefers present consumption over future consumption). On the other hand, the source of his demand for cash is the utility attached to money (the personal satisfaction derived from money in allowing him immediate purchases of directly or indirectly serviceable consumer or producer goods at uncertain future dates).

Accordingly, if the demand for money increases while the social stock of money is given, this additional demand can only be satisfied by bidding down the money prices of nonmoney goods. The purchasing power of money will increase, the *real* value of individual cash balances will be raised, and at a higher purchasing power per unit money, the demand for and the supply of money will once again be equilibrated. The relative price of money versus nonmoney will have changed. But unless time preference is assumed to have changed at the same time, *real* consumption and *real* investment will remain the same as before: the additional money demand is satisfied by reducing nominal consumption *and* investment spending in accordance with the same pre-existing consumption/investment proportion, driving the money prices of both consumer as well as producer goods down and leaving real consumption and investment at precisely their old levels. If time preference is assumed to change concomitantly with an increased demand for money, however, then everything is possible. Indeed, if spending were reduced exclusively on investment goods, an increased demand for money could even go hand in hand with an increase in the rate of interest and reduced saving and investment. However, this, or the equally possible opposite outcome, would not be due to a change in the demand for money but exclusively to a change (a rise, or a fall) in the time preference schedule. In any case, if the banking system were to follow Selgin’s advice and accommodate an increased demand for cash by issuing fiduciary credit, the social rate of time preference would be falsified, excessive investment would result, and a boom-bust cycle would be set in motion, rendering the practice of fractional reserve banking fraudulent *as well as* economically inefficient.

White’s and Selgin’s proposal of a commodity money based system of competitive fractional reserve banking—of partial fiat money—is neither just (and hence the term “free banking” is inappropriate), nor does it produce economic stability. It is no fundamental improvement as compared to the monetarist reality of monopolistically issued pure fiat currencies. Indeed, in one respect Friedman’s pure fiat money proposal contains a more realistic and correct analysis than White’s and Selgin’s because Friedman recognizes “what used to be called ‘the inherent instability’ of fractional reserve banking”, and he understands that this inherent instability of competitive fractional reserve banking will sooner or later collapse in a “liquidity crisis” and then lead to his favored regime—a governmentally provided pure fiat currency—anyway.[^31]

Only a system of universal commodity money (gold), competitive banks, *and* 100-percent-reserve deposit banking with a strict functional separation of loan and deposit banking constitutes a just monetary system that can assure economic stability and present a genuine answer to the current monetarist fiasco.
