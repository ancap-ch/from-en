### Rationalism and Relativism in the Natural and Social Sciences


Philosophical rationalism claims that man is capable of recognizing ultimate foundations and principles of knowledge. It recognizes that all knowledge which must be presupposed insofar as one argues about any knowledge claim whatsoever (and thus cannot be meaningfully disputed because it is the precondition of meaningful doubt) is ultimately justified or a priori valid. The law of contradiction is an example of such knowledge. Moreover, philosophical rationalism asserts that based on the recognition of such ultimate truths, man is capable of systematic scientific progress.

Relativism denies the existence of absolute foundations of knowledge and the possibility of scientific progress.

There appears to be little or no evidence in support of relativism in the natural sciences. It is undeniable that the history of the natural sciences has been one of continuous progress, and that man has achieved mastery over nature far surpassing that of bygone ages. Moreover, disciplines such as propositional logic, arithmetic, Euclidean geometry, rational mechanics (classical mechanics without gravitation), and chronometry, all of which have been termed “protophysics”, provide perfect examples of the rationalist idea of ultimately founded knowledge. Logic and protophysics must be presupposed if one is to say anything meaningful at all, or if one is to make any empirical measurement of space, time, and material and thus cannot possibly be invalidated by human experience or measurement. (Euclidean geometry, for instance, cannot be said to have been falsified by the theory of relativity because the establishment of the theory of relativity presupposes the validity of Euclidean geometry in the construction of the measurement instruments.)

On the contrary, in full agreement with the claims of rationalism, it appears that it is precisely the status of logic and protophysics as absolutely a priori justified theories which makes progress in the empirical natural sciences systematically possible.[^1]

[^1]: On this in particular Paul Lorenzen, *Methodisches Denken* (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1968); idem, *Normative Logic and Ethics* (Mannheim: Bibliographisches Institut, 1969),

::::> Geometry, chronometry and hylometry [rational mechanics] are a priori theories which make empirical measurement of space, time and material “possible”. They have to be established before physics in the modern sense of all empirical science, with its hypothetical fields of forces, can begin. Therefore, I should like to call these three disciplines by the common name: *protophysics*. The true sentences of protophysics are those sentences which are defendable on the basis of logic, arithmetic and analysis, definitions and the ideal norms which make measurements possible. (p. 60)

This view of the natural sciences and their development has come under criticism in the wake of Thomas Kuhn’s much celebrated book, *The Structure of Scientific Revolutions*.[^2] In detailed analyses of central episodes in the history of the empirical natural sciences, Kuhn therein challenged the view that the process of scientific development could be described as gradually progressing towards truth through a series of hypothetical conjectures, crucial experiments, and the elimination of experimentally falsified theories, with every future generation knowing more than the previous one. Instead, according to Kuhn it has been a noncumulative, nonteleological process. Different “paradigms” or fundamental views of the essence of nature followed and supplanted one another as temporary orthodoxies, with each paradigm immune from, and irrefutable by, experience, and different paradigms incommensurable with each other. Shifts of paradigms were not motivated by incontrovertible experiences but were akin to religious conversions. Old paradigms died out as the scientists who had promoted them died away; new ones took their place as new generations of scientists, infected by conversion fever, grew up, with each generation gaining new knowledge from the adoption of a new creed as well as losing old knowledge in having abandoned the paradigms of past generations.

Does Kuhn’s work, then, call for a revision of the rationalist interpretation of the natural sciences and establish a case for relativism? While Kuhn is inclined to think so, and while others, most notably Paul Feyerabend, have even radicalized Kuhn’s relativistic aspirations to a “methodological anarchism” with the battle cry “anything goes”,[^3] there can be little doubt that neither Kuhn, Feyerabend, nor anyone else has successfully persuaded the general public outside of the ivory towers of academia to accept a relativistic model of the natural sciences. Now as before, the general public is convinced of the views of rationalism, and justly so.

[^3]: See Paul Feyerabend, *Against Method* (London: New Left Books, 1975); idem, *Science in a Free Society* (London: New Left Books, 1978); idem, *Wissenschaftals Kunst* (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1984).

This is not to say that there is not some partial truth contained in Kuhn’s and Feyerabend’s often fascinating investigations. It is certainly true, and noteworthy, that losses of knowledge can occur even in the natural sciences, and that it is therefore profitable to study not only the most recent publications in one’s field but also the writings of authors long past and forgotten. It is also true that motives such as power, prestige, income, animosity, and friendship do not become inoperative once people turn to the study of nature. (Who, for instance, is ready to abandon a theory to whose development he has committed his entire life’s work only because the world around is increasingly defecting to another incompatible paradigm?) Indeed, as an economist one can go even further and admit the possibility of scientific regression: A process of capital consumption, followed by lower general standards of living, a reduced population, a disintegration of markets, and the division of labor, as has repeatedly occurred in the history of mankind, would inevitably result in a decrease in man’s knowledge of nature.

Yet even when all this is said, rationalism’s claims are not affected in the least. For one thing, Kuhn’s and Feyerabend’s relativism surely cannot be extended to logic and protophysics. If one wants to make a meaningful proposition, or any measurement at all, “anything” does *not* go. Such disciplines, which incidentally have remained largely outside the scope of Kuhn’s and Feyerabend’s considerations, are *absolutely* indispensable for *any* empirical natural science (and not merely irrefutable paradigms capable of substitution by other, incommensurable ones). However, once this is recognized, and once it is understood that proposition-making, counting, the construction of measurement instruments, and measuring, all of which make the empirical natural sciences possible, are purposeful activities, it immediately becomes clear that the paradigms of the natural sciences must be conceived of as means toward some universal, indispensable human end, and that they must be commensurable as regards their efficiency in attaining this end.[^4]

[^4]: See on this also Hans-Hermann Hoppe, “On Praxeology and the Praxeological Foundation of Epistemology and Ethics”, in Jeffrey Herbener, ed., *The Meaning of Ludwig von Mises* (Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1991).

The relativistic impression of the development of the empirical natural sciences that Kuhn and Feyerabend try to convey can be traced to the fact that they both misconceive of scientific theories as mere systems of verbal propositions and systematically ignore their foundation in the reality of action. Only if one regards theories as being completely detached from action does any single theory not only become immunizable, but any two rival theories whose respective terms cannot be reduced to and defined in terms of each other must then appear completely incommensurable so as to exclude any rational choice between them. However, this affects neither the refutability of any one theory, nor the commensurability of rival paradigms, on the entirely different level of applying them in the reality of action, of using them as instruments for the attainment of a practical purpose. On the level of mere words, paradigms may be irrefutable and incommensurable, but in practice they never can be. In fact, one could not even state that any single paradigm was irrefutable or any two paradigms were incommensurable and in what respect, unless one presupposed a common categorical framework that could serve as the basis for such an assessment or comparison. It is this *practical* refutability and commensurability of the paradigms of the empirical natural sciences that explains the possibility of technological progress.

In systematically ignoring the fact that theories and theoretically interpreted observations are those of an actor, built and made in order to act successfully, Kuhn and Feyerabend have deprived themselves of the very criterion against which all knowledge concerning nature is continually tested and commensurated: the criterion of successfully reaching a set goal by applying knowledge in a given situation, or of failing to do so. Without the criterion of instrumental success, relativism would be inescapable. Yet in each of our actions visà-vis nature, we confirm the claim of rationalism that one can identify a range of applications for some theoretical knowledge and test it for its success within this range, and hence, that competing theories must be considered commensurable as regards such ranges of application and success. No situation is conceivable in which it would be rational to give up an intellectual tool which had once proven successful in a range of applications if no better tool were available. Yet if a superior tool were available, for example, a theory or paradigm that allowed one to reach a goal that could not be reached equally successfully by applying another, incompatible theory, it would be irrational for an actor not to adopt it. To be sure, such irrational behavior is empirically possible. However, whoever chose it would have to pay a price for doing so. He would deprive himself of the ability to achieve goals that he otherwise could accomplish, and isolated from all social contexts which might offer other, socio-psychological reasons not to adopt it, alone vis-à-vis nature, no one capable of distinguishing between successful and unsuccessful action would ever want to pay such a price. It is this which explains the unacceptability of a relativist view of the natural sciences and the possibility of the actually observable continuous—if at times for socio-psychological reasons somewhat erratic—progress in man’s mastery of nature, which Kuhn and Feyerabend would declare nonexistent, although all the while it seems to be staring them in the face.[^5]

The situation is very different if one turns from the natural to the social sciences. Here the claims of rationalism seem to find far less support, and relativism has gained widespread public acceptance.[^6]

Foremost among the indicators cited in support of relativism is the observation that there is nothing in the development of the social sciences resembling the progress which has been achieved in the natural sciences. While our predictive powers and instrumental control over nature have dramatically increased since the times of Plato and Aristotle, the development of the empirical social sciences has been characterized by a standstill. In spite of the availability of all sorts of technical gadgets, such as high-speed computers, it appears that we are in no better position today to predict social events or to planfully bring about social change than were Plato or Aristotle in their days. (One might note that even if the validity of this observation is admitted, the relativistic conclusion to which it allegedly leads does not directly follow. It only follows if it is presupposed that the criteria for progress in the social sciences are indeed identical to those in the natural sciences. Proponents of social relativism take this for granted, yet it is by no means obvious why this should be so. On the contrary, in the natural sciences the object of knowledge [nature] and the subject of this knowledge [an actor] are different separate entities. In the social sciences, on the other hand, the objects of knowledge and research are themselves knowers and researchers. In light of this categorical difference, it would seem anything but clear why the methodology appropriate for the natural and the social sciences could possibly be one and the same. In fact, it is entirely unsurprising that when it comes to predicting predictors, or instrumentally controlling instrumental controllers, there *cannot* be any systematic progress of the kind observed in the natural sciences! [^7])

Moreover, proponents of relativism usually point out, apparently there is no analogue in the social sciences to the role played by logic and protophysics as the a prioristic foundations of the empirical natural sciences. The rationalist claim, associated in particular with the “natural law” tradition, that such an analogue is provided by economics and ethics,[^8] has either been forgotten and disappeared from public consciousness or is dismissed out of hand: Economics, it is held, is an empirical science very much like physics, with the objective of producing predictive knowledge, but unlike physics it fails to deliver the promised goods. As regards the observation that prosperous as well as poor societies exist, which would seem to make room for economic explanations after all—though not for explanations of the kind offered by physics—the proponents of social relativism contend that such differences have no *economic* reasons but are due to different degrees of *technological* knowledge. Rich societies are rich because of their advanced state of technology; poverty is due to a lack of natural-scientific know-how. Two objections to this view appear obvious: (1) The description of the facts is false. Do not the underdeveloped societies send their future scientists and engineers in large numbers to the universities of the advanced countries, and do not these poor societies then have access to the *same* knowledge upon their return as the rich ones? (2) More important still, technological know-how can only have a material impact if it is utilized. However, in order to do this, there must be savings and investment. It is not the availability of technical or scientific knowledge that imposes limits on a society’s prosperity; rather, it is the amount of savings and investment that imposes limits on the exploitation of actually available knowledge and on scientific progress, insofar as research activities, too, must be supported by saved-up funds. Hence, contrary to relativistic views, economics seems to have something to do with prosperity and poverty after all! [^9]

Nor, it is claimed, does ethics offer support for anything but relativism, for does not the fact of continuous and, so it seems, ineradicable differences of opinion in the field of contemporary politics prove the case of ethical relativism conclusively? Does not social anthropology, the study of societies such as the Fidshi islanders, or the natives of New Guinea, for instance, add still more evidence in support of relativistic conclusions? There are institutions such as cannibalism or slavery which a relativist might be hard pressed to defend. However, according to ethical relativists, regarding these practices as counter-evidence is the result of a misconception. The problem with these institutions is not that they invalidate relativism but that societies adopting them are still under the spell of social rationalism. That is, they still falsely believe in an absolutely founded ethic. Ethical relativism, its proponents claim, rules out intolerant practices such as these and implies a pluralism of values. (But is it not obvious that this doctrine is entirely fallacious? Without an absolute, a priori foundation, a value pluralism is itself just another unfounded ideology, and there is no compelling reason to adopt it over any other one. Only if a priori valid reasons could be given for adopting pluralism could it claim to safeguard tolerance and could cannibalism or slavery then be ruled out as acceptable social practices.[^10])
