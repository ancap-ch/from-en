## Fallacies of the Public Goods Theory and the Production of Security

공공 재화론의 오류와 안보 생산

In 1849, at a time when classical liberalism was still the dominant ideological force and “economist” and “socialist” were generally considered antonyms, Gustave de Molinari, a renowned Belgian economist, wrote,

1849년, 고전적 자유 주의가 여전히 지배적인 이념적 세력이었고,"경제학자"와 "사회 주의자"가 일반적으로 반대어로 여겨졌을 때, 유명한 벨기에의 경제학자인 구스타브 데 몰리나리는,썼다:

> If there is one well-established truth in political economy, it is this: That in all cases, of all commodities that serve to provide for the tangible or intangible need of the consumer, it is in the consumer’s best interest that labor and trade remain free, because the freedom of labor and trade have as their necessary and permanent result the maximum reduction of price. And this: That the interest of the consumer of any commodity whatsoever should always prevail over the interests of the producer. Now, in pursuing these principles, one arrives at this rigorous conclusion: That the production of security should in the interest of consumers of this intangible commodity remain subject to the law of free competition. Whence it follows: That no government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity.[^1]

왜냐하면 노동과 무역의 자유는 그들의 필요하고 영구적인 결과로서 가격의 최대 감소를 가지고 있기 때문이다. 그리고 이것은:어떤 상품의 소비자의 이익이 항상 생산자의 이익보다 우선해야 한다는 것이다.자, 이런 원칙들을 추구함에 있어서 이 엄중한 결론에 도달한다: 보안 생산은 이 무형의 상품의 소비자를 위하여. 자유 경쟁 법의 적용을 받아야 한다.다음과 같은 이점이 있다: 어떤 정부도 다른 정부와 경쟁하는 것을 막을 권리를 가져서도 안 되고, 보안 소비자들이 이 상품을 위해 독점적으로 그것에 오도록 요구할 권리를 가져서는 안 된다..[^1]


He comments on this whole argument by saying, “Either this is logical and true, or else the principles on which economic science is based are invalid.”[^2]

그는 이 모든 논쟁에 대해 이렇게 말한다: "이것은 논리적이고 사실이다. 그렇지 않으면 경제학에 기초를 두고 있는 원칙들이 유효하지 않다."[^2]


There is apparently only one way out of this unpleasant (for all socialists, that is) conclusion: to argue that there are particular goods to which for some special reasons the above economic reasoning does not apply. It is this that the so-called public goods theorists are determined to prove.[^3] However, I will demonstrate that in fact no such special goods or special reasons exist, and that the production of security in particular does not pose a problem any different from that of the production of any other good or service, be it houses, cheese, or insurance. In spite of its many followers, the whole public goods theory is faulty, flashy reasoning, riddled with internal inconsistencies, non sequiturs, appealing to and playing on popular prejudices and assumed beliefs, but with no scientific merit whatsoever.[^4]

이 불쾌한 결론을 벗어날 수 있는 방법은 분명히 한가지뿐이다 ((모든 사회 주의자들, 즉): 다음과 같이 주장한다, 위의 경제적 추론이 적용되지 않는 특별한 상품이 있다. 소위 말하는 공공 재화 이론가들이 증명하기로 결정한 것이 바로 이것이다..[^3]  그러나, 나는 사실 그러한 특별한 물건이나 특별한 이유가 존재하지 않는다는 것을 증명할 것이다, 그리고 보안 생산이 가정, 치즈 또는 보험에 있어서 다른 상품이나 서비스의 생산과 다른 문제를 야기하지 않는다는 것이다. 많은 추종자들에도 불구하고, 모든 공적 재화론은 불완전하고 현란한 추론이며, 내부적 모순, 불합리한 수사로 가득하고, 대중의 편견에 호소하고 믿게 하고 있고, 믿게 하지만 과학적 가치는 전혀 없다.[^4] 


What, then, does the escape route that socialist economists have found in order to avoid drawing Molinari’s conclusion look like? Since Molinari’s time it has become more common to answer yes to the question of whether there are goods to which different sorts of economic analyses apply. As a matter of fact, it is almost impossible to find a single contemporary economics textbook that does not stress the vital importance of the distinction between private goods, for which the truth of the economic superiority of a capitalist order of production is generally admitted, and public goods, for which it is generally denied.[^5] Certain goods or services (including security) are said to be special because their enjoyment cannot be restricted to those who have actually financed their production. Rather, people who do not participate in financing them also draw benefits from them. Such goods are called public goods or services (as opposed to private goods or services, which exclusively benefit those people who actually pay for them). Because of this special feature of public goods, it is argued, markets cannot produce them, or at least not in sufficient quantity or quality; hence, compensatory state action is required.[^6]

몰리나리의 결론을 회피하기 위해 사회주의 경제학자들이 발견한 탈출로는 어떤 모습일까? 몰리나리 시대 이후로, 다양한 종류의 경제 분석이 적용되는 상품이 있는지 여부에 대한 질문에 예스라고 대답하는 것이 더 일반적이 되었다.다름이아니라 자본주의 체제의 생산적 우월성을 일반적으로 인정하고 있는 민간 제품과 일반적으로 이를 중시하지 않는 공적 제품의 차이의 중요성을 강조하는 현대 경제학 교과서를 단 하나도 찾기 어렵다.[^5]  어떤 재화나 용역은 (보안 포함) 실제로 그들의 생산에 자금을 댄 사람들에게 그들의 즐거움이 제한될 수 없기 때문에 특별하다고 한다.오히려, 그들에게 자금을 지원하지 않는 사람들도 그들로부터 혜택을 받는다.그러한 상품들은 공공 재화나 용역이라고 불린다((실제로 돈을 지불하는 사람들에게만 이익을 주는 사적인 상품 또는 서비스와는 대조적으로).[^6]


The examples given by different authors of alleged public goods vary widely. Authors often classify the same good or service differently, leaving almost no classification of a particular good undisputed, which clearly foreshadows the illusory character of the whole distinction.[^7] Nonetheless, some examples that enjoy particularly popular status as public goods are the fire brigade that stops a neighbor’s house from catching fire, thereby letting him profit from my fire brigade, even though he did not contribute anything to financing it; or the police that, by walking around my property scare away potential burglars from my neighbor’s property as well, even if he did not help finance the patrols; or the lighthouse, an example particularly dear to economists,[^8] that helps a ship find its way even though the ship’s owner did not contribute a penny to its construction or upkeep.

공공 재화의 이 특별한 특징 때문에, 시장은 그러한 상품을 생산할 수 없거나, 최소한 충분한 수량이나 품질로 생산할 수 없다고 주장된다. 따라서 보상 상태 조치가 필요한다.[^6] 여러 작가들에 의해 제시된 공적 상품의 예가 매우 다양한다.작가들은 종종 동일한 재화나 용역을 다르게 분류하는 경우가 많아서, 논쟁의 여지가 없는 특정한 상품을 거의 분류하지 않는데, 이것은 전체적인 구별의 환상적 성격을 분명히 예고한다.[^7] 그럼에도 불구하고, 공공 재화로서 특히 인기 있는 몇몇 예는 이웃의 집에 불이 붙는 것을 막는 소방대이다,그가 나의 소방대에서 이익을 얻게 하여 주시고, 그가 이 소방대에 자금을 대는 데는 아무런 도움이 되지 않았지만, 아니면 경찰이 내 집 주변을 걸어 다님으로써 이웃의 재산을 빼앗아 갈 수도 있는 도둑들이, 설사 그가 도움이 되지 않았다 하더라도, 순찰대에 자금을 댄다.등대의 경우, 특히 경제학자들에게 중요한 예로, 비록 등대 소유주가 등대의 건설이나 유지에 한푼도 기여하지 않았음에도 불구하고 배를 찾는 데 도움을 주는[^8].


Before continuing with the presentation and critical examination of the theory of public goods, I will investigate how useful the distinction between private and public goods is in helping decide what should be produced privately and what should be provided by the state or with state help. Even the most superficial analysis could not fail to point out that using the alleged criterion of inexcludability, rather than presenting a sensible solution, would get one into deep trouble. While at least at first glance it seems that some of the stateprovided goods and services might indeed qualify as public goods, it certainly is not obvious how many of the goods and services that are actually produced by states could come under the heading of public goods. Railroads, postal services, telephone, streets, and the like seem to be goods whose usage can be restricted to the persons who actually finance them, and hence appear to be private goods. And the same seems to be the case regarding many aspects of the multidimensional good “security”: everything for which insurance could be taken out would have to qualify as a private good. Yet this does not suffice. Just as many state-provided goods appear to be private goods, so many privately produced goods seem to fit in the category of a public good. Clearly my neighbors would profit from my wellkept rose garden—they could enjoy the sight of it without ever helping me garden. The same is true of all kinds of improvements that I could make on my property that would enhance the value of neighboring property as well. Even those people who do not throw money in his hat can profit from a street musician’s performance. Those fellow passengers on the bus who did not help me buy it profit from my deodorant. And everyone who ever meets me would profit from my efforts, undertaken without their financial support, to turn myself into a most lovable person. Now, do all these goods—rose gardens, property improvements, street music, deodorants, personal improvements—since they clearly seem to possess the characteristics of public goods, then have to be provided by the state or with state assistance?

공적인 물건들의 이론의 발표 그리고 비판적인 조사를 계속하기 전에,나는 사적인 것과 공적인 것의 차이가 무엇이 사적으로 생산되어야 하는지 그리고 국가나 정부의 도움으로 무엇을 제공되어야 하는지를 결정하는데 얼마나 도움이 되는지 조사할 것이다. 심지어 가장 피상적인 분석도 합리적인 해결책을 제시하는 것보다는 배제할 수 없다는 주장된 기준을 사용하는 것이 사람을 깊은 곤경에 빠뜨릴 것이라는 것을 지적한다.적어도 얼핏 보기에는 정부가 지원하는 상품과 서비스의 일부가 실제로 공적인 재화로 간주되는 듯 하다. 실제로 국가에 의해 생산되는 재화와 용역의 얼마나 많은 수가 공공 재화의 헤딩 하에 들어갈 수 있는지는 명백하지 않다. 철도, 우편, 전화, 거리 등은 실제로 자금을 대는 사람들에 의해 사용이 제한될 수 있는 상품으로 보인다. 그러므로 그것은 사적인 물건처럼 보인다.다차원적으로 우수한 "보안"측면에서도 마찬가지인 것 같다:보험에 들 수 있는 모든 것들이 사적인 이득이 될 것이다.그러나 이것으로는 충분치 않다.정부가 제공하는 많은 물품들이 사적인 물품으로 보이는 것처럼,그래서 많은 사적으로 생산된 상품들이 공적인 재화의 범주에 적합한 것으로 보인다.분명 내 이웃들은 내 잘 알려 진 장미 정원에서 이득을 얻을 것이다- 그들은 내가 정원을 가꾸는 것을 돕지 않고도 그것을 즐길 수 있었다.이웃한 재산의 가치를 높일 수 있는 내 재산에 대한 모든 종류의 개선도 마찬가지다.심지어 그의 모자에 돈을 던지지 않는 사람들도 길거리 악사들의 연주로 이득을 볼 수 있다.버스에 타고 있던 동료 승객들은 제가 탈취제를 통해 이득을 얻는 것을 도와 주지 않았다.그리고  나를 만나는 모든 사람들은 재정적인 도움 없이 자신을 가장 사랑스러운 사람으로 만들기 위한 나의 노력에서 이득을 얻을 것이다.자, 이 모든 상품들을 해 봐--장미 정원, 재산 개선, 거리 음악, 데오드란트, 개인적인 개선들--그들이 공공 재화의 특성을 분명히 소유하고 있는 것 같기 때문에,정부나 정부의 도움을 받아 제공되어야 하는가?




As these examples of privately produced public goods indicate, there is something seriously wrong with the thesis of public goods theorists that public goods cannot be produced privately, but instead require state intervention. Clearly they can be provided by markets. Furthermore, historical evidence shows us that all of the so-called public goods that states now provide have at some time in the past actually been provided by private entrepreneurs or even today are so provided in one country or another. For example, the postal service was once private almost everywhere; streets were privately financed and still are sometimes; even the beloved lighthouses were originally the result of private enterprise;[^9] private police forces, detectives, and arbitrators exist; and help for the sick, the poor, the elderly, orphans, and widows has been a traditional concern of private charity organizations. To say, then, that such things cannot be produced by a pure market system is falsified by experience a hundredfold.

Apart from this, other difficulties arise when the public-private goods distinction is used to decide what and what not to leave to the market. For instance, what if the production of so-called public goods did not have positive but had negative consequences for other people, or if the consequences were positive for some and negative for others? What if the neighbor whose house was saved from burning by my fire brigade had wished (perhaps because he was overinsured) that it had burned down; or my neighbors hate roses, or my fellow passengers find the scent of my deodorant disgusting? In addition, changes in the technology can change the character of a given good. For example, with the development of cable TV a good that was formerly (seemingly) public has become private. And changes in the laws of property—of the appropriation of property—can have the very same effect of changing the public-private character of a good. The lighthouse, for instance, is a public good only insofar as the sea is publicly (not privately) owned. But if it were permitted to acquire pieces of the ocean as private property, as it would be in a purely capitalist social order, then as the lighthouse shines over only a limited territory, it would clearly become possible to exclude nonpayers from the enjoyment of its services.

Leaving this somewhat sketchy level of discussion and looking into the distinction between private and public goods more thoroughly, we discover that the distinction turns out to be completely illusory. A clear-cut dichotomy between private and public goods does not exist, and this is essentially why there can be so many disagreements on how to classify a given good. All goods are more or less private or public and can—and constantly do—change with respect to their degree of privateness/publicness as people’s values and evaluations change, and as changes occur in the composition of the population. In order to recognize that they never fall, once and for all, into either one or the other category, one must only recall what makes something a good. For something to be a good it must be recognized and treated as scarce by someone. Something is not a good as such, that is to say; goods are goods only in the eyes of the beholder. Nothing is a good unless at least one person subjectively evaluates it as such. But then, when goods are never goods-as-such—when no physico-chemical analysis can identify something as an economic good—there is clearly no fixed, objective criterion for classifying goods as either private or public. They can never be private or public goods as such. Their private or public character depends on how few or how many people consider them to be goods, with the degree to which they are private or public changing as these evaluations change and range from one to infinity. Even seemingly completely private things like the interior of my apartment or the color of my underwear can thus become public goods as soon as somebody else starts caring about them.[^10] And seemingly public goods, like the exterior of my house or the color of my overalls, can become extremely private goods as soon as other people stop caring about them. Moreover, every good can change its characteristics again and again; it can even turn from a public or private good to a public or private bad or evil and vice versa, depending solely on the changes in this caring or uncaring. If this is so, then no decision whatsoever can be based on the classification of goods as private or public.[^11] In fact, to do so it would become necessary to ask virtually every individual with respect to every single good whether or not he happened to care about it—positively or negatively and perhaps to what extent—in order to determine who might profit from what and who should therefore participate in the good’s financing. (And how could one know if they were telling the truth?) It would also become necessary to monitor all changes in such evaluations continuously, with the result that no definite decision could ever be made regarding the production of anything, and as a consequence of a nonsensical theory all of us would be long dead.[^12]

But even if one were to ignore all these difficulties and were willing to admit, for the sake of argument that the private-public good distinction does hold water, the argument would not prove what it is supposed to. It neither provides conclusive reasons why public goods—assuming that they exist as a separate category of goods—should be produced at all, nor why the state rather than private enterprises should produce them. This is what the theory of public goods essentially says, having introduced the aforementioned conceptual distinction: The positive effects of public goods for people who do not contribute anything to their production or financing proves that these goods are desirable. But evidently they would not be produced, or at least not in sufficient quantity and quality, in a free, competitive market, since not all of those who would profit from their production would also contribute financially to make the production possible. In order to produce these goods (which are evidently desirable, but would not be produced otherwise), the state must jump in and assist in their production. This sort of reasoning, which can be found in almost every textbook on economics (Nobel laureates not excluded)[^13] is completely fallacious on two counts.

For one thing, to come to the conclusion that the state has to provide public goods that otherwise would not be produced, one must smuggle a norm into one’s chain of reasoning. Otherwise, from the statement that because of some special characteristics they have, certain goods would not be produced, one could never reach the conclusion that these goods *should* be produced. But with a norm required to justify their conclusion, the public goods theorists clearly have left the bounds of economics as a positive, *wertfrei* science. Instead they have moved into the realm of morals or ethics, and hence one would expect to be offered a theory of ethics as a cognitive discipline in order for them to do legitimately what they are doing and to justifiably derive their conclusion. But it can hardly be stressed enough that nowhere in public goods theory literature can anything that even faintly resembles such a cognitive theory of ethics be found.[^14] Thus it must be stated at the outset, that public goods theorists are misusing whatever prestige they might have as positive economists for pronouncements on matters on which, as their own writings indicate, they have no authority whatsoever. Perhaps, though, they have stumbled on something correct by accident, without having supported it with an elaborate moral theory? It becomes apparent that nothing could be further from the truth as soon as one explicitly formulates the norm that would be needed to arrive at the conclusion that the state has to assist in the provision of public goods. The norm required to reach the above conclusion is this: whenever one can somehow prove that the production of a particular good or service has a positive effect on someone else but would not be produced at all or would not be produced in a definite quantity or quality unless certain people participated in its financing, then the use of aggressive violence against these persons is allowed, either directly or indirectly with the help of the state, and these persons may be forced to share in the necessary financial burden. It does not need much comment to show that chaos would result from implementing this rule, as it amounts to saying that anyone can attack anyone else whenever he feels like it. Moreover, as I have demonstrated in detail elsewhere[^15] this norm could never be justified as a fair norm. To argue so, in fact to argue at all, in favor of or against anything, be it a moral, nonmoral, empirical, or logico-analytical position, it must be presupposed that contrary to what the norm actually says, each individual’s integrity as a physically independent decision-making unit is assured. For only if everyone is free from physical aggression by everyone else could anything first be said and then agreement or disagreement on anything possibly be reached. The principle of nonaggression is thus the necessary precondition for argumentation and possible agreement and hence can be argumentatively defended as a just norm by means of a priori reasoning.

[^6]: Another frequently used criterion for public goods is that of “nonrivalrous consumption.” Generally, both criteria seem to coincide: When free riders cannot be excluded, nonrivalrous consumption is possible; and when they can be excluded, consumption becomes rivalrous, or so it seems. However, as public goods theorists argue, this coincidence is not perfect. It is, they say, conceivable that while the exclusion of free riders might be possible, their inclusion might not be connected with any additional cost (the marginal cost of admitting free riders is zero, that is), and that the consumption of the good in question by the additionally admitted free rider will not necessarily lead to a subtraction in the consumption of the good available to others. Such a good would be a public good, too. And since exclusion would be practiced on the free market and the good would not become available for nonrivalrous consumption to everyone it otherwise could—even though this would require no additional costs—this, according to statist-socialist logic, would prove a market failure, i.e., a suboptimal level of consumption. Hence the state would have to take over the provision of such goods. (A movie theater, for instance, might be only half full, so it might be “costless” to admit additional viewers free of charge, and their watching the movie also might not affect the paying viewers; hence the movie would qualify as a public good. Since, however, the owner of the theater would be engaging in exclusion, instead of letting free riders enjoy a “costless” performance, movie theaters would be ripe for nationalization.) On the numerous fallacies involved in defining public goods in terms of nonrivalrous consumption see notes 12 and 17 below.

[^10]: See, for instance, the ironic case that Block makes for socks being public goods in “Public Goods and Externalities.”

[^11]: To avoid any misunderstanding here, every single producer and every association of producers making joint decisions can, at any time, decide whether or not to produce a good based on an evaluation of the privateness or publicness of the good. In fact, decisions on whether or not to produce public goods privately are constantly made within the framework of a market economy. What is impossible is to decide whether or not to ignore the outcome of the operation of a free market based on the assessment of the degree of privateness or publicness of a good.

[^12]: In fact, then, the introduction of the distinction between private and public goods is a relapse into the pre-subjectivist era of economics. From the point of view of subjectivist economics, no good exists that can be categorized objectively as private or public. This is essentially why the second proposed criterion for public goods—permitting nonrivalrous consumption (see note 6 above)—breaks down too. For how could any outside observer determine whether or not the admittance of an additional free rider at no charge would not indeed lead to a subtraction in the consumption of a good to others? Clearly there is no way that he could objectively do so. In fact, it might well be that one’s enjoyment of a movie or of driving on a road would be considerably reduced if more people were allowed in the theater or on the road. Again, to find out whether or not this is the case one would have to ask every individual—and not everyone might agree (what then?). Furthermore, since even a good that allows nonrivalrous consumption is not a free good, as a consequence of admitting additional free riders “crowding” would eventually occur, and hence everyone would have to be asked about the appropriate “margin.” In addition, my consumption may or may not be affected depending on who it is that is admitted free of charge, so I would have to be asked about this, too. And finally, everyone might change his opinion on all of these questions over time. It is thus in the same way impossible to decide whether or not a good is a candidate for state (rather than private) production based on the criterion of nonrivalrous consumption as on that of nonexcludability (see also note 17 below).

Hayek, *Law, Legislation and Liberty* (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1979), vol. 3, chap. 14.

[^14]: Economists in recent years, particularly the Chicago School, have been increasingly concerned with the analysis of property rights. Harold Demsetz, “The Exchange and Enforcement of Property Rights,” *Journal of Law and Economics* 7 (1964); idem, “Toward a Theory of Property Rights,” *American Economic Review* (1967); Ronald Coase, “The Problem of Social Cost,” *Journal of Law and Economics* 3 (1960); Armen Alchian, *Economic Forces at Work* (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1977), part 2; Richard Posner, *Economic Analysis of the Law* (Boston: Brown, 1977). Such analyses, however, have nothing to do with ethics. On the contrary, they represent attempts to substitute economic efficiency considerations for the establishment of justifiable ethical principles [on the critique of such endeavors see Murray N. Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty* (Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Humanities Press, 1982), chap. 26; Walter Block, “Coase and Demsetz on Private Property Rights,” *Journal of Libertarian Studies* 1, no. 2 (1977); Ronald Dworkin, “Is Wealth a Value,” *Journal of Legal Studies* 9 (1980); Murray N. Rothbard, “The Myth of Efficiency,” in Mario Rizzo, ed., *Time Uncertainty and Disequilibrium* (Lexington, Mass.: D.C. Heath, 1979). Ultimately, all efficiency arguments are irrelevant because there simply exists no nonarbitrary way of measuring, weighing, and aggregating individual utilities or disutilities that result from some given allocation of property rights. Hence any attempt to recommend some particular system of assigning property rights in terms of its alleged maximization of “social welfare” is pseudo-scientific humbug. See in particular, Murray N. Rothbard, *Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics* (New York: Center for Libertarian Studies, Occasional Paper Series No. 3, 1977); also Lionel Robbins, “Economics and Political Economy,” *American Economic Review* (1981).

The “Unanimity Principle” which Buchanan and Tullock, following Knut Wicksell (*Finanztheoretische Untersuchungen*, Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1896), have repeatedly proposed as a guide for economic policy is also not to be confused with an ethical principle proper. According to this principle only such policy changes should be enacted which can find unanimous consent—and that surely sounds attractive; but then, *mutatis mutandis*, it also determines that the status quo be preserved if there is less than unanimous agreement on any proposal of change—and that sounds far less attractive, because it implies that any given, present state of affairs regarding the allocation of property rights must be legitimate either as a point of departure or as a to-be-continued-state. However, the public choice theorists offer no justification in terms of a normative theory of property rights for this daring claim as would be required. Hence, the unanimity principle is ultimately without ethical foundation. In fact, because it would legitimize any conceivable status quo, the Buchananites’ most favored principle is no less than outrightly absurd as a moral criterion. See on this also Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty* chap. 26; idem, “The Myth of Neutral Taxation,” pp. 549f.

Whatever might still be left for the unanimity principle, Buchanan and Tullock, following the lead of Wicksell again, then give away by reducing it in effect to one of “relative” or “quasi” unanimity.
