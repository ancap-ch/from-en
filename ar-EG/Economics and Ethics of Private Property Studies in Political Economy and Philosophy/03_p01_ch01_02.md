Tetapi teori barang-barang publik yang rusak bukan hanya karena rusak penalaran moral yang tersirat di dalamnya. Bahkan yang utilitarian, penalaran ekonomi yang terkandung dalam argumen di atas jelas-jelas salah. Sebagai teori barang publik menyatakan, itu juga mungkin bahwa itu akan baik untuk memiliki barang-barang publik daripada tidak memilikinya, meskipun hal ini tidak boleh dilupakan bahwa tidak ada alasan yang harus jadi kebutuhan (yang kemudian akan mengakhiri teori barang-barang publik' penalaran di sini). Untuk lebih jelas mungkin, dan memang diketahui sebuah fakta, bahwa kaum anarkis ada yang begitu sangat membenci tindakan negara bahwa mereka akan lebih memilih tidak memiliki apa yang disebut barang publik sama sekali untuk memiliki mereka yang disediakan oleh negara.[^16] Dalam kasus apapun, bahkan jika argumen adalah kebobolan sejauh ini, untuk melompat dari pernyataan bahwa barang-barang publik yang diinginkan untuk pernyataan bahwa mereka karena itu harus disediakan oleh negara adalah apa-apa tapi konklusif, karena hal ini tidak berarti pilihan yang dihadapkan. Karena uang atau sumber daya lainnya harus ditarik dari alternatif yang mungkin digunakan untuk membiayai seharusnya diinginkan barang-barang publik, hanya yang relevan dan sesuai pertanyaannya adalah apakah atau ini tidak menggunakan uangalternatif yang bisa dimasukkan (yaitu, barang-barang pribadi yang bisa diperoleh, tapi sekarang tidak bisa dibeli karena uang yang dibelanjakan pada bukan barang-barang publik) yang lebih berharga—yang lebih penting—dari barang-barang publik. Dan jawaban untuk pertanyaan ini adalah sangat jelas. Dalam hal evaluasi konsumen, namun tinggi mutlak tingkat mungkin, nilai barang-barang publik relatif lebih rendah daripada yang bersaing barang-barang pribadi karena jika salah satu telah meninggalkan pilihan untuk konsumen (dan tidak memaksa salah satu alternatif atas mereka), mereka ternyata lebih suka menghabiskan uang mereka berbeda (jika tidak ada kekuatan yang akan diperlukan). Ini membuktikan tanpa keraguan bahwa sumber daya yang digunakan untuk penyediaan barang-barang publik yang terbuang sia-sia karena mereka menyediakan konsumen dengan barang atau jasa yang terbaik adalah hanya kepentingan sekunder. Dalam waktu singkat, bahkan jika salah satu diasumsikan bahwa barang-barang publik yang dapat dibedakan dengan jelas dari barang-barang pribadi yang ada, dan bahkan jika itu diberikan yang diberikan masyarakat baik yang mungkin berguna, barang-barang publik masih akan bersaing dengan barang-barang pribadi. Dan hanya ada satu cara untuk mencari tahu apakah atau tidak mereka adalah lebih mendesak yang diinginkan dan sampai sejauh mana, atau *mutatis mutandis*, jika, dan sejauh mana, produksi mereka akan berlangsung dengan mengorbankan tidak diproduksi atau berkurangnya produksi yang lebih dibutuhkan barang-barang pribadi: dengan memiliki segala sesuatu yang disediakan oleh perusahaan swasta yang bersaing bebas. Oleh karena itu, bertentangan dengan kesimpulan yang didapat oleh teori barang-barang publik, logika akan memaksa seseorang untuk menerima hasil yang hanya murni sistem pasar dapat menjaga rasionalitas, dari sudut pandang konsumen, keputusan untuk menghasilkan masyarakat yang baik. Dan hanya di bawah murni kapitalis agar bisa dipastikan bahwa keputusan tentang berapa banyak masyarakat baik untuk menghasilkan (disediakan itu harus diproduksi sama sekali) akan rasional juga.[^17] Tidak kurang dari semantik revolusi yang benar-benar dimensi Orwellian akan diperlukan untuk datang dengan hasil yang berbeda. Hanya jika seseorang bersedia untuk menafsirkan seseorang "tidak" benar-benar berarti "ya," "tidak membeli sesuatu" sebagai arti bahwa itu adalah benar-benar "lebih memilih dari mana orang yang tidak membeli bukan sebaliknya tidak membeli," "kekuatan" benar-benar berarti "kebebasan", "tidak dikontrak" benar-benar berarti "membuat kontrak" dan sebagainya, bisa teori barang-barang publik ' "terbukti."[^18] Tapi bagaimana kemudian bisa kita pastikan bahwa mereka benar-benar berarti apa yang tampaknya berarti ketika mereka mengatakan apa yang mereka katakan, dan tidak lebih berarti sebaliknya, atau tidak berarti apa-apa dengan pasti isi sama sekali, tetapi hanya mengoceh? Kami tidak bisa. Murray N. Rothbard sehingga benar-benar tepat ketika dia komentar pada usaha barang-barang publik ideolog untuk membuktikan keberadaan disebut kegagalan pasar karena tidak diproduksi atau kuantitatif atau kualitatif "kekurangan" produksi barang-barang publik. Ia menulis,

> [s]uch a view completely economic science asserts that free-market action is *ever* optimal. It is optimal, not from the standpoint of the personal ethical views of an economist, but from the standpoint of free, voluntary actions of all participants and in satisfying the freely expressed needs of the consumers. Government interference, therefore, will necessarily and always move *away* from such an optimum.[^19]

Memang, argumen yang seharusnya membuktikan kegagalan pasar tidak ada yang pendek sungguh tidak masuk akal. Dilucuti dari mereka menyamar jargon teknis semua mereka membuktikan ini: Sebuah pasar yang tidak sempurna, karena hal ini ditandai dengan prinsip non-agresi yang dikenakan pada kondisi yang ditandai oleh kelangkaan, dan begitu barang atau jasa tertentu yang hanya bisa diproduksi dan disediakan jika agresi diizinkan tidak akan diproduksi. Cukup benar, tetapi tidak ada pasar teori akan pernah berani menyangkal hal ini. Namun, dan ini adalah yang menentukan, "ketidaksempurnaan" pasar dapat dipertahankan, moral serta ekonomis, padahal seharusnya "kesempurnaan" dari pasar disebarkan oleh teori barang-barang publik tidak bisa terjadi.[^20] Hal ini juga benar bahwa penghentian negara saat ini praktek penyediaan barang-barang publik akan berarti beberapa perubahan dalam struktur sosial yang ada dan distribusi kekayaan. Seperti reshuffle pasti akan berarti kesulitan bagi beberapa orang. Sebagai soal fakta, ini adalah persis mengapa ada publik yang luas tahan terhadap kebijakan privatisasi fungsi negara, meskipun dalam jangka panjang secara keseluruhan kekayaan sosial akan ditingkatkan dengan ini sangat kebijakan. Tentunya, namun, fakta ini tidak dapat diterima sebagai argumen yang valid menunjukkan kegagalan pasar. Jika seorang pria telah diizinkan untuk memukul orang lain pada kepala dan sekarang tidak diizinkan untuk melanjutkan dengan praktek ini, dia pasti terluka. Tapi satu tidak akan menerima itu sebagai alasan yang sah untuk menegakkan tua (memukul) aturan. Dia dirugikan, tapi merugikan dirinya berarti mengganti tatanan sosial di mana setiap konsumen memiliki hak yang sama untuk menentukan apa dan berapa banyak dari apa yang diproduksi, untuk sistem di mana beberapa konsumen memiliki hak untuk menentukan apa yang menghormati konsumen lain tidak diperbolehkan untuk membeli secara sukarela apa yang mereka inginkan dengan cara yang adil yang diperoleh oleh mereka dan yang mereka miliki. Tentu saja, seperti substitusi akan lebih baik dari sudut pandang semua konsumen sebagai sukarela konsumen.

Dengan kekuatan penalaran logis, kita harus menerima kesimpulan Molinari bahwa untuk kepentingan konsumen, semua barang dan jasa yang dapat disediakan oleh pasar.[^21] Hal ini tidak hanya palsu yang jelas-jelas dapat dibedakan kategori barang yang ada, yang akan membuat khusus amandemen tesis umum dari kapitalisme ekonomi keunggulan diperlukan; bahkan jika mereka tidak ada, tidak ada alasan khusus bisa ditemukan mengapa ini seharusnya barang-barang publik khusus tidak harus juga dapat diproduksi oleh perusahaan swasta, karena mereka selalu berdiri dalam persaingan dengan barang-barang pribadi. Pada kenyataannya, terlepas dari semua propaganda dari teori barang-barang publik, efisiensi yang lebih besar dari pasar dibandingkan dengan negara semakin menyadari dengan hormat untuk lebih dan lebih dari yang diduga barang-barang publik. Hadapi sehari-hari dengan pengalaman, hampir tidak ada yang serius mempelajari hal-hal ini bisa menyangkal bahwa saat ini pasar bisa menghasilkan layanan pos, kereta api, listrik, telepon, pendidikan, uang, jalan-jalan dan sebagainya lebih efektif daripada negara, yaitu, lebih ke keinginan dari konsumen. Namun orang-orang umumnya menghindar dari menerima dalam satu sektor tertentu apa logika kekuatan kepada mereka: dalam produksi keamanan. Oleh karena itu, untuk sisa dari bab ini saya akan mengalihkan perhatian saya untuk menjelaskan segala fungsi ekonomi kapitalis dalam hal ini khususnya daerah—keunggulan dan logis kasus telah dibuat oleh sekarang, tapi yang akan diberikan lebih persuasif setelah beberapa empiris bahan yang ditambahkan untuk analisis dan dipelajari sebagai sebuah masalah dalam dirinya sendiri.[^22]

How would a system of nonmonopolistic, competing producers of security work? It should be clear from the outset that in answering this question one is leaving the realm of purely logical analysis and hence the answers must lack the certainty, the apodictic character of pronouncements on the validity of the public goods theory. The problem faced is precisely analogous to that of asking how a market would solve the problem of hamburger production, especially if up to this point hamburgers had been produced exclusively by the state and hence no one could draw on past experience. Only tentative answers could be formulated. No one could possibly know the exact structure of the hamburger industry—how many competing companies would come into existence, what importance this industry might have compared to others, what the hamburgers would look like, how many different sorts of hamburgers would appear on the market and perhaps disappear again because of a lack of demand, and so on. No one could know all of the circumstances and the changes that would influence the very structure of the hamburger industry—changes in the demands of various consumer groups, changes in technology, changes in the prices of various goods that affect the industry directly or indirectly, and so on. It must be stressed that although similar issues arise concerning the private production of security, this by no means implies that nothing definitive can be said. Assuming certain general conditions of demand for security services (conditions that more or less realistically reflect the world as it presently is) what can and will be said is how different social orders of security production, characterized by different structural constraints under which they have to operate, will respond differently.[^23] Let me first analyze the specifics of monopolistic, state-run security production, for at least in this case one can draw on ample evidence regarding the validity of the conclusions reached and then compare this system with what could be expected if it were replaced by a nonmonopolistic one.

Even if security is considered to be a public good, in the allocation of scarce resources it must compete with other goods. What is spent on security can no longer be spent on other goods that also might increase consumer satisfaction. Moreover, security is not a single, homogeneous good, but rather consists of numerous components and aspects. There is not only prevention of crime, detection of criminals, and enforcement of the law, but there is also security from robbers, rapists, polluters, natural disasters, and so on. Moreover, security is not produced in a “lump,” but can be supplied in marginal units. In addition, different people attach different importance to security as a whole, and also to different aspects of the whole thing, depending on their personal characteristics, their past experiences with various factors of insecurity, and the time and place in which they happen to live.[^24] Here I address the fundamental economic problem of allocating scarce resources to competing uses, how can the state—an organization not financed exclusively by voluntary contributions and the sales of its products but rather partially or even wholly by taxes—decide how much security to produce, how much of each of its countless aspects, to whom and where to provide how much of what? The answer is that it has no rational way to decide this question. From the point of view of the consumers, its response to their security demands must be considered arbitrary. Do we need one policeman and one judge, or 100,000 of each? Should they be paid $100 a month or $10,000? Should the policemen, however many we might have, spend more time patrolling the streets, chasing robbers, and recovering stolen loot, or spying on participants in victimless crimes such as prostitution, drug use, or smuggling? And should the judges spend more time and energy hearing divorce cases, traffic violations, cases of shoplifting, and murder, or antitrust cases? Clearly, all of these questions must be answered somehow because as long as there is scarcity and we do not live in the Garden of Eden, the time and money spent on one thing cannot be spent on another. The state must answer these questions, too, but whatever it does, it does it without being subject to the profit-and-loss criterion. Hence, its action is arbitrary and necessarily involves countless wasteful misallocations from the consumer’s viewpoint.[^25] Independent to a large degree of consumer wants, the state-employed security producers instead do what they like. They hang around instead of doing anything, and if they do work they prefer doing what is easiest or work where they can wield power rather than serving consumers. Police officers drive around a lot, hassle petty traffic violators, spend huge amounts of money investigating victimless crimes that many people (i.e., nonparticipants) do not like but that few would be willing to spend their money on to fight, as they are not immediately affected by them. Yet with respect to what consumers want most urgently—the prevention of hardcore crime (i.e., crimes with victims), the apprehension and effective punishment of hard-core criminals, the recovery of loot, and the securement of compensation of victims of crimes from the aggressors—the police are notoriously inefficient, in spite of ever higher budget allocations.

Furthermore, whatever state-employed police or judges happen to do (arbitrary as it must be), they will tend to do poorly because their income is more or less independent of the consumer’s evaluations of their services. Thus one observes police arbitrariness and brutality and the slowness in the judicial process. Moreover, it is remarkable that neither the police nor the judicial system offers consumers anything even faintly resembling a service contract in which it is laid down in unambiguous terms what procedure the consumer can expect to be set in motion in a specific situation. Rather, both operate in a contractual void that over time allows them to change their rules of procedure arbitrarily and that explains the truly ridiculous fact that the settlement of disputes between police and judges on the one hand and private citizens on the other is not assigned to an independent third party, but to another policeman or judge who shares employers with one party—the government—in the dispute.

[^16]: See on this argument Rothbard, “The Myth of Neutral Taxation,” p. 533\. Incidentally, the existence of one single anarchist also invalidates all references to Pareto optimality as a criterion for economically legitimate state action.

[^17]: Essentially the same reasoning that leads one to reject the socialist-statist theory built on the allegedly unique character of public goods as defined by the criterion of nonexcludability, also applies when, instead, such goods are defined by means of the criterion of nonrivalrous consumption (see notes 6 and 12 above). For one thing, in order to derive the normative statement that they *should* be so offered from the statement of fact that goods that allow nonrivalrous consumption *would not* be offered on the free market to as many consumers as could be, this theory would face exactly the same problem of requiring a justifiable ethics. Moreover, the utilitarian reasoning is blatantly wrong, too. To reason, as the public goods theorists do, that the free-market practice of excluding free riders from the enjoyment of goods that would permit nonrivalrous consumption at zero marginal costs would indicate a suboptimal level of social welfare and hence would require compensatory state action is faulty on two related counts. First, cost is a subjective category and can never be objectively measured by any outside observer. Hence, to say that additional free riders could be admitted at no cost is totally inadmissible. In fact, if the subjective costs of admitting more consumers at no charge were indeed zero, the private owner-producer of the good in question would do so. If he does not do so, this reveals that the costs for him are *not* zero. The reason may be his belief that to do so would reduce the satisfaction available to the other consumers and so would tend to depress the price for his product; or it may simply be his dislike for uninvited free riders as, for instance, when I object to the proposal that I turn over my less-thancapacity-filled living room to various self-inviting guests for nonrivalrous consumption. In any case, since for whatever reason the cost cannot be assumed to be zero, it is then fallacious to speak of a market failure when certain goods are not handed out free of charge. On the other hand, welfare losses would indeed become unavoidable if one accepted the public goods theorists’ recommendation of letting goods that allegedly allow for nonrivalrous consumption to be provided free of charge by the state. Besides the insurmountable task of determining what fulfills this criterion, the state, independent of voluntary consumer purchases as it is, would first off face the equally insoluble problem of rationally determining *how much* of the public good to provide. Clearly, since even public goods are not free goods but are subject to “crowding” at some level of use, there is no stopping point for the state, because at any level of supply there would still be users who would have to be excluded and who, with a larger supply, could enjoy a free ride. But even if this problem could be solved miraculously, in any case the (necessarily inflated) cost of production and operation of the public goods distributed free of charge for nonrivalrous consumption would have to be paid for by taxes. And this then, i.e., the fact that consumers would have been coerced into enjoying their free rides, again proves beyond any doubt that these public goods, too, are of inferior value from the point of view of consumers to the competing private goods that they now no longer can acquire.

[^18]: The most prominent modern champions of Orwellian double talk are Buchanan and Tullock (see their works cited in note 3 above). They claim that government is founded by a “constitutional contract” in which everyone “conceptually agrees” to submit to the coercive powers of government with the understanding that everyone else is subject to it too. Hence government is only *seemingly* coercive but *really* voluntary. There are several evident objections to this curious argument. First, there is no empirical evidence whatsoever for the contention that any constitution has ever been voluntarily accepted by everyone concerned. Worse, the very idea of all people voluntarily coercing themselves is simply inconceivable, much in the same way as it is inconceivable to deny the law of contradiction. For if the voluntarily accepted coercion is voluntary, then it would have to be possible to revoke one’s subjection to the constitution, and the state would be no more than a voluntarily joined club. If, however, one does not have the “right to ignore the state”—and that one does not have this right is, of course, the characteristic mark of a state as compared to a club—then it would be logically inadmissible to claim that one’s acceptance of state coercion is voluntary. Furthermore, even if all this were possible, the constitutional contact could still not claim to bind anyone except the original signers of the constitution.

How can Buchanan and Tullock come up with such absurd ideas? By a semantic trick. What was “inconceivable” and “no agreement” in pre-Orwellian talk is for them “conceptually possible” and a “conceptual agreement.” For a most instructive short exercise in this sort of reasoning in leaps and bounds, see James Buchanan, “A Contractarian Perspective on Anarchy,” in idem, *Freedom in Constitutional Contract* (College Station: Texas A&M University Press, 1977). Here we learn (p. l7) that even the acceptance of the 55 mph speed limit is possibly voluntary (Buchanan is not quite sure) since it ultimately rests on all of us conceptually agreeing on the constitution, and that Buchanan is not really a statist, but in truth an anarchist (p. 11).

[^19]: Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*, p. 887.

[^20]: This, first of all, should be kept in mind whenever one has to assess the validity of statist-interventionist arguments such as the following, by John Maynard Keynes (“The End of Laissez Faire,” in idem, *Collected Writings*, London: Macmillan, 1972, vol. IX, p. 291):

> The most important Agenda of the state relates not to those activities which private individuals are already fulfilling but to those functions which fall outside the sphere of the individual, to those decisions which are made by no one if the state does not make them. The important thing for government is not to do things which individuals are doing already and to do them a little better or a little worse: but to do those things which are not done at all.

This reasoning not only *appears* phony, it truly is.

[^21]: Some libertarian minarchists object that the existence of a market presupposes the recognition and enforcement of a common body of law, and hence a government as a monopolistic judge and enforcement agency. (See, for example, John Hospers, *Libertarianism* [Los Angeles: Nash, 1971]; Tibor Machan, *Human Rights and Human Liberties* [Chicago: Nelson-Hall, 1975].) Now it is certainly correct that a market presupposes the recognition and enforcement of those rules that underlie its operation. But from this it does not follow that this task must be entrusted to a monopolistic agency. In fact, a common language or sign-system is also presupposed by the market; but one would hardly think it convincing to conclude that hence the government must ensure the observance of the rules of language. Like the system of language, then, the rules of market behavior emerge spontaneously and can be enforced by the “invisible hand” of self-interest. Without the observance of common rules of speech, people could not reap the advantages that communication offers, and without the observance of common rules of conduct, people could not enjoy the benefits of the higher productivity of an exchange economy based on the division of labor. In addition, as I indicated above, independent of any government the nonaggression principle underlying the operation of markets can be defended a priori as just. Moreover, as I will argue in the conclusion of this chapter, it is precisely a competitive system of law-administration and law-enforcement that generates the greatest possible pressure to elaborate and enact rules of conduct that incorporate the highest degree of *consensus* conceivable. And of course the very rules that do just this are those that a priori reasoning establishes as the logically necessary presupposition of argumentation and argumentative agreement.

[^22]: Incidentally, the same logic that would force one to accept the idea of the production of security by private business as economically the best solution to the problem of consumer satisfaction also forces one, so far as moral-ideological positions are concerned, to abandon the political theory of classical liberalism and take the small but nevertheless decisive step (from there) to the theory of libertarianism, or private property anarchism. Classical liberalism, with Ludwig von Mises as its foremost representative in the twentieth century, advocates a social system based on the nonaggression principle. And this is also what libertarianism advocates. But classical liberalism then wants to have this principle enforced by a monopolistic agency (the government, the state)—an organization, that is, which is not exclusively dependent on voluntary, contractual support by the consumers of its respective services, but instead has the right to unilaterally determine its own income, i.e., the taxes to be imposed on consumers in order to do its job in the area of security production. Now, however plausible this might sound, it should be clear that it is inconsistent. Either the principle of nonaggression is valid, in which case the state as a privileged monopolist is immoral, or business built on and around aggression—the use of force and of noncontractual means of acquiring resources—is valid, in which case one must toss out the first theory. It is impossible to sustain both contentions and not to be inconsistent unless, of course, one could provide a principle that is more fundamental than both the nonaggression principle and the states’ right to aggressive violence and from which both, with the respective limitations regarding the domains in which they are valid, can be logically derived. However, liberalism never provided any such principle, nor will it ever be able to do so, since, to argue in favor of anything presupposes one’s right to be free of aggression. Given the fact then that the principle of nonaggression cannot be argumentatively contested as morally valid without implicitly acknowledging its validity, by force of logic one is committed to abandoning liberalism and accepting instead its more radical child: libertarianism, the philosophy of pure capitalism, which demands that the production of security be undertaken by private business too.

[^25]: To say that the process of resource allocation becomes arbitrary in the absence of the effective functioning of the profit-loss criterion does not mean that the decisions that somehow have to he made are not subject to any kind of constraint and hence are pure whim. They are not, and any such decisions face certain constraints imposed on the decision maker. If, for instance, the allocation of production factors is decided democratically, then it evidently must appeal to the majority. But if a decision is constrained in this way or if it is made in any other way, it is still arbitrary from the point of view of voluntarily buying or not-buying consumers.

Regarding *democratically* controlled allocations, various deficiencies have become quite evident. As, for example, James Buchanan and Richard E. Wagner write (*The Consequences of Mr. Keynes* [London: Institute of Economic Affairs, 1978], p. 19):

> Market competition is continuous; at each purchase, a buyer is able to select among competing sellers. Political competition is intermittent; a decision is binding generally for a fixed number of years. Market competition allows several competitors to survive simultaneously…. Political competition leads to an all-or-nothing outcome…. In market competition the buyer can be reasonably certain as to just what it is that he will receive from his purchase. In political competition, the buyer is in effect purchasing the services of an agent, whom he cannot bind…. Moreover, because a politician needs to secure the cooperation of a majority of politicians, the meaning of a vote for a politician is less clean than that of a “vote” for a private firm.

See also James M. Buchanan, “Individual Choice in Voting and the Market,” in idem, *Fiscal Theory and Political Economy* (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 1962); for a more general treatment of the problem Buchanan and Tullock, *The Calculus of Consent.*

What has commonly been overlooked, though—especially by those who try to make a virtue of the fact that a democracy gives equal voting power to everyone, whereas consumer sovereignty allows for unequal “votes”—is the most important deficiency of all: Under a system of consumer sovereignty people might cast unequal votes but, in any case, they exercise control exclusively over things that they acquired through original appropriation or contract and hence are forced to act morally. Under a democracy of production everyone is assumed to have something to say regarding things one did not so acquire; hence, one is permanently invited thereby not only to create legal instability with all its negative effects on the process of capital formation, but, moreover to act immorally. See on this also Ludwig von Mises, *Socialism* (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1981), chap. 31.
