## Perbankan, Bangsa, Negara, dan Politik Internasional: Suatu Sosiologis Rekonstruksi Ekonomi Saat Order
### Uang dan Perbankan
Dalam rangka untuk menjelaskan munculnya barter, tidak lebih dari asumsi yang sempit didefinisikan kepentingan diri diperlukan. Sejauh pria lebih suka lebih banyak pilihan dan barang-barang yang lDidorong oleh tidak lebih dari kepentingan sempit, manusia akan selalu memilih yang lebih umum dan, jika mungkin, universal media pertukaran untuk yang kurang umum atau nonuniversal satu.ebih sedikit, ia akan memilih barter dan pembagian kerja atas swasembada
Munculnya uang dari barter berikut dari kepentingan sempit, jika pria yang terintegrasi dalam ekonomi barter dan lebih suka yang lebih tinggi untuk standar hidup yang lebih rendah, ia akan memilih untuk memilih dan mendukung media pertukaran umum. Dalam memilih uang yang ia dapat mengatasi mendasar pembatasan yang dikenakan pada pertukaran dengan barter ekonomi, yaitu, yang membutuhkan adanya kebetulan ganda dari keinginan. Dengan uang nya kemungkinan untuk pertukaran melebar. Setiap yang baik menjadi tidak dapat ditukar untuk setiap lainnya, terlepas dari kebetulan ganda atau divisibilities yang tidak sempurna. Dan dengan nilai tukar yang melebar ini, nilai dari setiap kebaikan yang dimilikinya meningkat.
Jika sebagai manusia yang terintegrasi dalam pertukaran ekonomi, kepentingan memaksa dia untuk melihat keluar untuk terutama barang-barang berharga yang memiliki uang yang diinginkan sifat seperti dibagi, daya tahan, recognizability, portabilitas dan kelangkaan, dan permintaan barang-barang tersebut tidak untuk kepentingan mereka sendiri tetapi untuk kepentingan mempekerjakan mereka sebagai media pertukaran. Dan itu adalah dalam kepentingan untuk memilih komoditas itu sebagai alat tukar yang juga digunakan sebagai tersebut paling sering oleh orang lain. Pada kenyataannya, itu adalah fungsi dari uang untuk memfasilitasi pertukaran, untuk memperluas jangkauan pertukaran kemungkinan, dan dengan demikian meningkatkan nilai dari satu barang (untuk sejauh bahwa mereka dianggap sebagai yang terintegrasi dalam pertukaran ekonomi). Dengan demikian, semakin banyak komoditi yang digunakan sebagai uang, yang lebih baik itu akan melakukan fungsi moneter. Didorong oleh tidak lebih dari kepentingan sempit, manusia akan selalu memilih yang lebih umum dan, jika mungkin, universal media pertukaran untuk yang kurang umum atau satu nonuniversal. Untuk yang lebih umum, lebih luas pasar yang lebih terintegrasi, lebih rasional salah satu nilai dan perhitungan biaya (dari sudut pandang seseorang yang menginginkan integrasi ekonomi dan maksimalisasi kekayaan), dan semakin besar manfaat yang satu dapat menuai dari pembagian kerja.[^1]
Secara empiris, tentu saja, komoditas yang dipilih sebagai yang terbaik-karena-paling-universal-uang emas. Tanpa paksaan pemerintah emas lagi akan dipilih untuk masa mendatang sebagai komoditas terbaik melakukan fungsi uang. Mandiri-suku bunga akan menyebabkan semua orang untuk lebih memilih emas sebagai universal digunakan alat pembayaran—untuk uang lainnya. Untuk sejauh bahwa setiap individu memandang dirinya dan harta miliknya sebagai diintegrasikan ke dalam pertukaran ekonomi, ia akan lebih memilih akuntansi dalam hal emas bukan dalam hal uang lainnya, karena emas penerimaan universal membuat seperti akuntansi ekspresi yang paling lengkap dari biaya peluang, dan karenanya berfungsi sebagai panduan terbaik dalam upaya untuk memaksimalkan kekayaan. Semua uang lainnya akan didorong keluar dari penggunaan dengan cepat, karena sesuatu yang kurang dari yang benar-benar universal dan uang internasional seperti emas—nasional atau regional uang, yang—akan bertentangan dengan tujuan dari memiliki uang di tempat pertama. Uang yang telah diciptakan oleh diri-pria tertarik dalam rangka untuk meningkatkan kekayaannya dengan mengintegrasikan dirinya ke yang terus melebar dan pada akhirnya pasar universal. Di jalan mengejar kepentingan diri, nasional atau regional uang akan dengan cepat keluar-bersaing dan digantikan oleh emas, karena hanya emas membuat integrasi ekonomi yang lengkap dan pasar di seluruh dunia, sehingga memenuhi fungsi utama uang sebagai media pertukaran umum.[^2]
Munculnya uang, semakin baik uang, dan akhirnya satu universal uang, emas, set produktif energi gratis yang sebelumnya tetap frustrasi dan menganggur karena ganda-kebetulan-dari-ingin-pembatasan dalam proses pertukaran (seperti keberadaan bersaing uang dengan bebas fluktuasi nilai tukar). Di bawah barter pasar untuk produsen output dibatasi untuk kasus ganda ingin kebetulan. Dengan semua harga yang dinyatakan dalam bentuk emas produsen pasar adalah maha meliputi, dan permintaan berlaku yang tidak dibatasi oleh tidak adanya kebetulan ganda pada skala dunia. Dengan demikian, produksi meningkat dan meningkatkan lebih lanjut dengan emas dari dengan uang lainnya. Dengan peningkatan produksi nilai uang pada gilirannya meningkat; dan semakin tinggi daya beli dari uang yang mengurangi satu reservasi permintaan untuk itu, menurunkan satu pertanyaan yang efektif tingkat preferensi waktu (orisinal tingkat bunga), dan menyebabkan peningkatan pembentukan modal. Atas spiral proses pembangunan ekonomi diatur dalam gerak.
Perkembangan ini menciptakan dasar bagi munculnya bank berupa uang-penanganan lembaga. Di satu sisi, bank datang ke depan untuk memenuhi meningkatnya permintaan untuk penyimpanan, pengangkutan, dan kliring uang. Di sisi lain, mereka memenuhi semakin penting fungsi memfasilitasi pertukaran antara kapitalis (savers) dan pengusaha (investor), benar-benar membuat hampir lengkap pembagian kerja antara peran-peran ini mungkin.Sebagai lembaga penyimpanan dan khususnya sebagai tabungan dan lembaga-lembaga kredit, bank-bank dengan cepat berasumsi pangkat saraf pusat-pusat ekonomi. Semakin banyak alokasi dan koordinasi spasial dan temporal sumber daya dan kegiatan ekonomi dilakukan melalui mediasi bank; dan dalam memfasilitasi koordinasi semacam itu kemunculan bank menyiratkan masih ada stimulus lain bagi pertumbuhan ekonomi.[^3]
Sementara itu dalam setiap kepentingan ekonomi yang ada hanya satu yang universal uang dan hanya satu unit Akun, dan manusia dalam mengejar maksimalisasi kekayaan tidak akan berhenti sampai tujuan tercapai, hal ini bertentangan dengan kepentingan tersebut yang ada hanya satu bank atau satu monopoli sistem perbankan. Sebaliknya, kepentingan pribadi memerintahkan agar setiap bank menggunakan uang universal yang sama-emas - dan bahwa saat itu tidak ada persaingan antara uang yang berbeda, namun persaingan bebas antara bank dan sistem perbankan, yang semuanya menggunakan emas, harus ada. Hanya begitu lama sebagai akses masuk ke perbankan ada akan ada efisiensi biaya dalam hal ini seperti pada bisnis lain, namun hanya selama kompetisi ini menyangkut jasa-jasa yang diberikan dalam hal yang satu dan sama uang komoditas akan perbankan yang benar-benar dapat memenuhi fungsi yang sangat uang dan perbankan, yaitu, memfasilitasi integrasi ekonomi daripada disintegrasi, pelebaran pasar dan memperluas pembagian kerja daripada membatasi mereka, membuat nilai dan akuntansi biaya lebih daripada kurang rasional, dan karenanya meningkat, bukannya menurun kekayaan ekonomi. Pengertian persaingan antara uang adalah *kontradiksi di adjecto*. Tegasnya, sistem moneter dengan saingan uang yang bebas dari fluktuasi nilai tukar masih sistem (parsial) barter, penuh dengan masalah yang memerlukan ganda kebetulan ingin di order untuk (beberapa) pertukaran untuk mengambil tempat. Adanya sistem seperti ini disfungsional dari tujuan uang.[^4] Bebas mengejar-nya sendiri, manusia akan segera meninggalkan itu—dan itu akan menjadi dasar kesalahpahaman mengenai esensi dari uang untuk berpikir pasar bebas tidak hanya dalam hal bersaing bank-bank tetapi juga dari segi kompetitif uang.[^5] Kompetitif uang yang bukan hasil dari pasar bebas tindakan tetapi selalu hasil dari paksaan, pemerintah memberlakukan hambatan ditempatkan di jalur ekonomi yang rasional perilaku.
Dengan layanan perbankan berdasarkan universal standar emas muncul, tujuan mencapai biaya yang paling efisien solusi untuk mengkoordinasikan dan memfasilitasi interspatial dan antarwaktu pertukaran dalam kerangka universal yang terintegrasi pasar dicapai. Harga untuk layanan jasa penyimpanan, pengangkutan dan kliring uang, serta untuk memajukan uang di waktu-kontrak akan turun kepada mereka serendah mungkin tingkat di bawah sebuah rezim bebas masuk. Dan karena harga-harga akan dinyatakan dalam satu universal uang, mereka akan benar-benar mencerminkan biaya minimum untuk menyediakan pasar-integratif pelayanan.
Moreover, bank competition combined with the fact that money must emerge as a commodity—such as gold—which in addition to its value as money has a commodity value and thus cannot be produced without significant cost-expenditure, also provides the best possible safeguard against fraudulent banking.

As money depositing institutions, banks—much like other institutions depositing fungible commodities yet more so in the case of banks because of the special role of the commodity money—are tempted to issue “fake” warehouse receipts, i.e., notes of deposit not covered by real money, as soon as such banknotes have assumed the role of money substitutes and are treated by market participants as unquestionable equivalents of actually deposited real money. In this situation, by issuing fake or fiat banknotes that physically cannot be distinguished from genuine money substitutes, a bank can—fraudulently and at another’s expense—increase its own wealth. It can directly purchase goods with such fake notes and thus enrich itself in the same way as any simple counterfeiter does. The bank’s real wealth and the wealth of the early recipients of the money increases through these purchases, and at the same time and by the same action the wealth of those receiving the new money late or not at all decreases, due to the inflationary consequences of counterfeiting. Or a bank can use such fiat money to expand its credit and earn interest on it. Once again a fraudulent income and wealth redistribution in the bank’s favor takes place.[^6] Yet in addition, this time a boom-bust cycle is also set in motion: Placed at a lowered interest rate, the newly granted credit causes increased investments and initially creates a boom that cannot be distinguished from an economic expansion; however, this boom must turn bust because the credit that stimulated it does not represent real savings but instead was created out of thin air. Hence, with the entire new and expanded investment structure under way, a lack of capital must arise that makes the successful completion of all investment projects systematically impossible and instead requires a contraction with a liquidation of previous malinvestments.[^7]

Under the gold standard any bank or banking system (including a monopolist one) would be constrained in its own inclination to succumb to such temptations by two requirements essential for successful counterfeiting. On the one hand, the banking public must not be suspicious of the trustworthiness of the bank—that is, its anti-fraud vigilance must be low for otherwise a bank run would quickly reveal the committed fraud. On the other hand, the bank cannot inflate its notes at such a pace that the public loses confidence in the notes’ purchasing power, reduces its reservation demand for them and flees instead towards “real” values, including real money, and thereby drives the counterfeiter into bankruptcy. Under a system of free banking, however, with no legal tender laws and gold as money, an additional constraint on potential bank fraud arises, for then every bank is faced with the existence of nonclients or clients of different banks. If in this situation additional counterfeit money is brought into circulation by a bank, it must invariably reckon with the fact that the money may end up in nonclients’ hands who demand immediate redemption, which the bank then would be unable to grant without at least a painful credit contraction. In fact, such a corrective contraction could only be avoided if the additional fiat money were to go exclusively into the cash reserves of the bank’s own clients and were used by them exclusively for transactions with other clients. Yet since a bank would have no way of knowing whether or not such a specific outcome could be achieved, or how to achieve it, the threat of a following credit contraction would act as an inescapable economic deterrent to any bank fraud.[^8]

### The State and the Monopolization of Money and Banking

Saat ini tatanan ekonomi ditandai oleh national uang bukan satu universal uang; dengan uang fiat, bukan komoditas seperti emas; oleh monopoli bank sentral bukan gratis perbankan; dan permanen penipuan bank, dan terus diulang pendapatan dan redistribusi kekayaan, inflasi permanen dan berulang siklus bisnis seperti ekonomi rekan-rekan, daripada 100-persen-perbankan cadangan dengan tidak ada konsekuensi ini.

Dalam menyelesaikan kontradiksi, maka, untuk pria kepentingan memaksimalkan kekayaan melalui integrasi ekonomi, berbeda antieconomic kepentingan yang berlaku atas orang-orang ekonomi harus bertanggung jawab terhadap munculnya kontemporer tatanan moneter.

Satu dapat memperoleh dan meningkatkan kekayaan baik melalui homesteading, memproduksi dan kontrak pertukaran, atau dengan mengambil alih dan mengeksploitasi homesteaders, produsen, atau kontrak exchanger. Tidak ada cara lain. Kedua metode alami untuk umat manusia. Di samping minat dalam memproduksi dan kontraktor selalu ada suatu kepentingan produktif dan noncontractual properti dan kekayaan akuisisi. Dan dalam perjalanan pembangunan ekonomi, seperti mantan bunga dapat menyebabkan pembentukan perusahaan-perusahaan yang produktif perusahaan dan perusahaan, sehingga dapat yang terakhir ini menyebabkan perusahaan-perusahaan berskala besar dan membawa tentang pemerintah atau negara.[^9]

Ukuran dan pertumbuhan yang produktif perusahaan dibatasi di satu sisi oleh sukarela permintaan konsumen, dan di sisi lain oleh persaingan dari produsen lain yang terus memaksa setiap perusahaan untuk beroperasi dengan biaya terendah yang mungkin jika ingin bertahan dalam bisnis. Untuk sebuah perusahaan untuk tumbuh dalam ukuran, yang paling mendesak keinginan konsumen harus disajikan dalam cara yang paling efisien. Apa-apa tapi sukarela pembelian konsumen dukungan ukurannya.

Kendala-kendala pada jenis lain dari lembaga—negara—yang sama sekali berbeda.[^10] Untuk satu hal, itu jelas tidak masuk akal untuk mengatakan bahwa munculnya dan pertumbuhan ditentukan oleh permintaan dalam arti yang sama seperti ekonomi perusahaan. Satu tidak bisa mengatakan dengan imajinasi bahwa homesteaders, produsen dan kontrak exchanger yang harus menyerah (bagian dari) aset mereka ke negara menuntut layanan tersebut. Sebaliknya, mereka dipaksa menerima hal itu, dan ini adalah bukti dari fakta bahwa layanan ini tidak dalam permintaan. Di sisi lain, negara juga tidak dibatasi dalam cara yang sama dengan kompetisi seperti yang produktif perusahaan. Untuk tidak seperti perusahaan, negara tidak harus menjaga biaya operasi yang minimal, tetapi dapat beroperasi di atas biaya minimum, karena mampu menggeser biaya yang lebih tinggi ke para pesaingnya dengan pajak atau mengatur perilaku mereka. Sejauh keadaan muncul, kemudian, hal ini tidak terlepas dari kenyataan bahwa itu tidak dalam permintaan atau efisien.

Instead of by cost and demand conditions, the growth of an exploiting firm is constrained by public opinion: Nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions require coercion, and coercion creates victims. It is conceivable that resistance can be lastingly broken by force in the case of one man (or one group of men) exploiting one or maybe two or three others (or a group of roughly the same size). It is inconceivable, however, to imagine that force alone can account for the breaking down of resistance in the actually familiar case of small minorities expropriating and exploiting populations ten, hundreds, or thousands of times their size. For this to happen a firm must have public support in addition to coercive force. A majority of the population must accept its operations as legitimate. This acceptance can range from active enthusiasm to passive resignation. However, acceptance it must be in the sense that a majority must have given up the idea of actively or passively resisting any attempt to enforce nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions. Instead of displaying outrage over such actions, of showing contempt for everyone who engages in them, and of doing nothing to help make them successful (not to mention actively trying to obstruct them), a majority must actively or passively support them. State-supportive public opinion must counterbalance the resistance of victimized property owners such that active resistance appears futile. And the goal of the state, then, and of every state employee who wants to contribute toward securing and improving his own position within the state, is and must be that of maximizing exploitatively acquired wealth and income by producing favorable public opinion and creating legitimacy.

Ada dua yang saling melengkapi langkah-langkah yang tersedia untuk negara berusaha untuk mencapai hal ini. Di satu sisi, ada propaganda ideologis. Banyak waktu dan usaha yang dihabiskan untuk membujuk masyarakat bahwa hal-hal yang tidak benar-benar seperti mereka muncul: Eksploitasi adalah benar-benar kebebasan; pajak-pajak yang benar-benar sukarela: noncontractual hubungan yang benar-benar "konseptual" kontrak;[^11] tidak ada yang diperintah oleh siapa pun tetapi kita semua aturan sendiri; tanpa negara baik hukum maupun keamanan yang ada; dan yang miskin akan binasa, dll.

Di sisi lain, ada redistribusi. Bukannya hanya parasit konsumen dari barang-barang yang lain telah diproduksi, negara meredistribusi beberapa paksa disesuaikan kekayaan kepada orang-orang di luar aparatur negara dan dengan demikian mencoba untuk korup mereka menjadi asumsi negara-mendukung peran.

Tapi bukan sembarang redistribusi yang akan dilakukan. Hanya sebagai ideologi harus melayani—statis—tujuan, jadi harus redistribusi. Redistribusi membutuhkan biaya pengeluaran dan dengan demikian membutuhkan pembenaran. Hal ini tidak dilakukan oleh negara hanya dalam rangka untuk melakukan sesuatu yang baik untuk beberapa orang, seperti, misalnya, ketika seseorang memberi orang lain yang hadir. Atau apakah hal itu dilakukan hanya untuk mendapatkan tinggi pendapatan yang mungkin dari bursa, seperti ketika ekonomi biasa bisnis yang terlibat dalam perdagangan. Hal ini dilakukan dalam rangka untuk mengamankan lebih lanjut keberadaan dan perluasan eksploitasi dan perampasan. Redistribusi harus melayani tujuan strategis. Biaya yang harus dibenarkan dalam hal peningkatan pendapatan negara dan kekayaan. Politik pengusaha bertanggung jawab aparatur negara dapat berbuat salah dalam tugas ini, seperti pengusaha biasa, karena keputusan mereka tentang yang redistributif langkah-langkah terbaik untuk melayani tujuan ini harus dilakukan dalam mengantisipasi mereka hasil yang sebenarnya. Dan jika kewirausahaan kesalahan terjadi, pendapatan negara dapat benar-benar jatuh bukan naik, bahkan mungkin membahayakan keberadaannya sendiri. Itu adalah tujuan dari politik negara dan fungsi politik kewirausahaan untuk menghindari situasi seperti itu dan memilih bukan sebuah kebijakan yang dapat meningkatkan pendapatan negara.

Sementara baik bentuk-bentuk tertentu dari kebijakan redistributif atau hasil-hasil tertentu yang dapat diprediksi, melainkan berubah sesuai dengan perubahan keadaan, sifat negara masih membutuhkan bahwa kebijakan redistributif harus mengikuti urutan tertentu dan menampilkan struktural tertentu keteraturan.[^12]

Sebagai perusahaan yang bergerak dalam maksimalisasi exploitatively disesuaikan kekayaan, negara pertama dan terutama di daerah di mana itu berlaku redistributif langkah-langkah produksi keamanan, yaitu polisi, pertahanan, dan sistem peradilan. Negara akhirnya bertumpu pada paksaan dan dengan demikian tidak dapat melakukan tanpa angkatan bersenjata. Apapun bersaing angkatan bersenjata—yang secara alami akan muncul di pasar dalam rangka untuk memenuhi permintaan tulus untuk keamanan dan perlindungan layanan—ini adalah ancaman bagi keberadaannya dan harus dihilangkan. Untuk melakukan ini adalah untuk merebut pekerjaan untuk dirinya sendiri dan menjadi monopoli pemasok dan redistributor dari layanan perlindungan bagi wilayah yang ditetapkan. Demikian pula, bersaing sistem peradilan akan menimbulkan ancaman langsung terhadap keadaan klaim legitimasi. Dan sekali lagi, demi eksistensinya sendiri sistem peradilan juga harus dimonopoli dan pelayanan hukum termasuk dalam redistributif skema.

Keadaan alam sebagai lembaga yang bergerak di bidang diselenggarakan agresi juga menjelaskan pentingnya kolom berikutnya redistributif kegiatan: bahwa lalu lintas dan komunikasi. Ada bisa menjadi tidak teratur eksploitasi tanpa monopoli kontrol dari sungai, pantai, seaways, jalan, rel kereta api, bandara, e-mail, dan sistem telekomunikasi. Dengan demikian, hal-hal ini, juga harus menjadi objek redistribusi.

Yang sama pentingnya adalah bidang pendidikan. Tergantung seperti halnya pada opini publik dan penerimaan negara sebagai tindakan yang sah, adalah penting untuk keadaan yang tidak menguntungkan ideologis kompetisi dihilangkan sejauh mungkin dan statis ideologi menyebar. Upaya negara untuk mencapai hal ini dengan menyediakan layanan pendidikan pada redistributif dasar.

Ditindaklanjuti oleh sistem pendidikan negara, selanjutnya penting untuk redistribusi adalah mendistribusikan kekuasaan negara itu sendiri, yaitu, hak diasumsikan oleh negara untuk mengambil alih, exploit dan mendistribusikan nonproductively disesuaikan aset. Bukannya tersisa sebuah lembaga yang membatasi masuk ke dalam dirinya sendiri dan/atau pemerintah tertentu posisi, keadaan semakin, dan jelas untuk alasan strategis, mengadopsi struktur organisasi yang pada prinsipnya membuka sejumlah posisi untuk semua orang dan hibah yang sama dan universal hak-hak partisipasi dan kompetisi dalam penentuan kebijakan negara. Setiap orang—bukan hanya hak istimewa bangsawan—menerima hukum saham dalam negeri dalam rangka untuk mengurangi resistensi terhadap kekuasaan negara.[^13]

Dengan monopoli hukum dan keamanan produksi, lalu lintas, komunikasi dan pendidikan, serta demokratisasi negara aturan itu sendiri, semua fasilitas negara modern telah diidentifikasi tetapi satu: negara monopoli uang dan perbankan. Untuk semua tapi yang satu ini telah dijelaskan, meskipun sebentar, bagaimana mereka dapat dan harus dipahami sebagai melakukan fungsi strategis: mengapa dan bagaimana mereka tidak normal produktif kontribusi ditentukan oleh permintaan dan penawaran pasukan atau hanya perbuatan baik, tetapi redistributif kegiatan yang bertujuan untuk menstabilkan dan, jika mungkin, meningkatkan keadaan ini exploitatively disesuaikan pendapatan dan kekayaan.

Monopoli uang dan perbankan adalah pilar utama di mana negara modern yang bertumpu. Pada kenyataannya, itu mungkin telah menjadi yang paling dihargai instrumen untuk meningkatkan pendapatan negara. Untuk tempat lain yang dapat negara membuat hubungan antara redistribusi-pengeluaran dan eksploitasi-kembali lebih langsung, cepat dan aman dibandingkan dengan memonopoli uang dan perbankan. Dan di tempat lain adalah negara skema kurang dipahami dengan jelas dari sini.

Preferring, like everyone, a higher to a lower income, yet unlike others, being in the business of nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions, the state’s position regarding money and banking is obvious: Its objectives are served best by a pure fiat money monopolistically controlled by the state. For only then are all barriers to counterfeiting removed (short of an entire breakdown of the monetary system through hyperinflation) and the state can increase its own income and wealth at another’s expense practically without cost and without having to fear bankruptcy.[^14]

However, there are obstacles in the way of attaining this enviable state of affairs. On one hand, there is the inexorable fact that money can emerge only as a commodity. (It is impossible to start out with fiat money).[^15] On the other hand, there is the problem that while enrichment through counterfeiting is no doubt less conspicuous than doing so by means of taxation, it is nonetheless a measure that is bound to be noticed, certainly by the banks, particularly if it occurs on a regular basis. And so it is also impossible for the state to get away with institutionalized counterfeiting unless it can be combined with redistributive measures which are capable of bringing about another favorable change in public opinion. This problem and the state’s natural desire essentially determine the course of its actions.

As the result of free market processes, the state finds gold established as money and a system of free banking. Its goal is the destruction of this system and with it the removal of all obstacles to counterfeiting. Technically (ignoring for the moment all psychological difficulties involved in this), the sequence of steps that must be taken in order to accomplish this objective is then dictated: In a first step the minting of gold must be monopolized by the state. This serves the purpose of psychologically denationalizing gold by shifting the emphasis from gold as denominated in universal terms of weight to gold as denominated in terms of fiat labels. And it removes a first important obstacle toward counterfeiting because it gives the state the very institutional means of enriching itself through a systematic process of currency debasement.

Second, the use of money substitutes instead of actual gold must be systematically encouraged and such a tendency backed up by the enactment of legal tender laws. The counterfeiting process thereby becomes much less costly. Instead of having to remint gold, only paper tickets must be printed.

However, the problem already discussed earlier remains. As long as a system of free banking is in operation, the counterfeit notes cannot be prevented from returning to the new issuer with the request for redemption, and he then cannot—at least not without a contractive adjustment—fulfill his obligations. To overcome this obstacle, in the next step the state must monopolize the banking system or force the competing banks into a cartel under the tutelage of its own state-operated central bank. Once it is in command of a monopolized or cartelized banking system, the state can put the coordinated and joint counterfeiting process of the entire banking system into effect that avoids this risk.

In the next step gold must be nationalized, i.e., the state must require all banks to deposit their gold at the central bank and conduct their business exclusively with money substitutes instead of gold. This way gold disappears from the market as an actually used medium of exchange and instead everyday transactions become increasingly characterized by the use of central banknotes.

Finally, gold being already out of sight and in the state’s sole possession, the state must cut the last tie to gold by reneging on its contractual obligations and declaring its notes irredeemable. Built on the ruins of gold, which as a commodity money standard initially made it possible that paper notes could actually acquire any purchasing power, a pure fiat money standard has been erected and can now be kept in operation, at long last handing the state the unlimited counterfeiting power that it had been vying for.

The goal of a complete counterfeiting autonomy likewise dictates the strategy that must be pursued on the psychological front. Obviously, in approaching its ultimate goal the state creates victims and thus it is also in need of favorable public opinion. Its rise to absolute counterfeiting power must be accompanied by redistributive measures that generate the support necessary to overcome all upcoming forces of resistance. It must look for allies.

Regarding the state’s monopolization of law and order, traffic, communication and education, and the democratization of its organizational structure—while it is clear that they are all redistributive measures and as such imply favoring one person at the expense of another—it is difficult if not impossible to identify the gainers and the losers with definite social classes: there can be gainers (or losers) across different classes: within one social class there can be gainers and losers; and the pattern of redistribution can shift over time. In all of these cases the link between the state’s redistributive expenditures and their payoffs is only indirect: whether or not certain education expenditures, for instance, pay off in terms of increased state income will only become visible at a later date; and even then it will be difficult to attribute such an outcome to a definite cause. In the case of the monopolization of money and banking, on the other hand, who outside the apparatus of the state itself will be the benefactors of its redistributive policies and who the losers will be is clear at once; and sociologically the benefactors can easily be identified with a specific social class. In this case the connection between the state’s handing out redistributive favors and its own enrichment is direct and close-circuited; and the attribution of causes obvious: The state is compelled to make banks and the social class of bankers its accomplices by allowing them to participate in its counterfeiting operations and so enrich themselves along with the state’s own enrichment.

Bankers would be the first ones to become aware of the state’s attempts at counterfeiting. Without special incentives to the contrary they would have no reason to support such actions and every reason to uncover and stop them as quickly as possible. And the state would not run into just any opposition here: bankers, because of their exalted position in economic life and in particular because of their far-reaching interconnectedness as a professional group resulting from the nature of their business as facilitators of interspatial and intertemporal exchanges, would be the most formidable opposition one might encounter. The incentive necessary to turn such potential enemies into natural allies is the state’s offer to cut them in on its own fraudulent machinations. Familiar with the ideas of counterfeiting and its great potential for one’s own enrichment, but knowing, too, that there is no chance of engaging in it without running the immediate risk of bankruptcy under free, competitive banking and a gold standard, bankers are faced with an almost irresistible temptation. Going along with the state’s policy of monopolizing money and banking also means fulfilling one’s own dreams of getting rich fast. Not only the state comes into its own once a pure fiat money standard is established. Provided that they are accorded the privilege by the state to counterfeit in addition to its own counterfeited notes under a monetary regime of less than 100-percent-reserve banking, with the central bank functioning as a last resort counterfeiter banks can only too easily be persuaded to regard the establishment of such a monetary system as their ultimate goal and as a universal panacea.[^16]

Economically, this coalition between the state—as the dominant partner—and the banking system—as its affiliate—leads to permanent inflation (constrained only by the imperative of not overdoing it and causing a breakdown of the entire monetary system), to credit expansion and steadily recurring boom-bust cycles, and to a smooth uninterrupted income and wealth redistribution in the state’s and the banks’ favor.

Still more important, however, are the sociological implications of this alliance: With its formation a ruling class whose interests are tied in closely with those of the state is established within civil society. Through its cooperation the state can now extend its coercive power to practically every area of society.

Before the establishment of the state-banking alliance, the sociological separation between state and society, i.e., between an exploitative ruling class and a class of exploited producers, is almost complete and clearly visible. Here is a civil society that produces all economic wealth; and there is the state and its representatives who draw parasitically on what others have produced. People are members either of civil society or the state and see their own interests connected with either the former or the latter. To be sure, there are then redistributive activities going on which favor parts of society at the expense of others and which help divert interests from the pursuit of economic integration to that of supporting exploitation. Yet social corruption is unsystematic at this stage. It is not corruption of social classes which are connected society-wide, but rather corruption of various disparate and dispersed individuals or groups. And these interests are only connected to those of the state rather tenuously through certain specific redistributive state activities, rather than through a direct cash-connection.

With the formation of a state-banking alliance all this becomes different. A cash-connection between parts of civil society and the state exists—and nothing ties people more closely together than joint financial interests. Moreover, this connection is established between the state and what can be identified not only as a closely interconnected social class, but as one of the most widely influential and powerful ones. In fact, it is not just the banks who join interests with the state and its policy of exploitation. The banks’ major clients, the business establishment and the leaders of industry become deeply integrated in the state’s counterfeiting schemes, too. For it is they who, apart from state and banks, are the earliest receivers of most of the regularly created counterfeit money. In receiving it before it gradually ripples through the economic system, and thereby changes relative prices as well as increases the overall price level, and in receiving credit at fraudulently lowered interest rates, they too enrich themselves at the expense of all savers and all later recipients or nonrecipients of this money.[^17]

Moreover, this financial coalition between the industrial establishment, banks, and the state tends to be reinforced by each successive course of events. The credit expansion leads to increased investment and—since it is not covered by an increase in genuine savings—will inevitably result in a corrective contraction. In order to avoid losses or even bankruptcy the bank’s clients will approach the banking system with an increased demand for liquidity (i.e., money). Naturally, to avoid losses of their own the banks are eager to help their clients out—and the more so the more established they are as clients. Unable to do this on their own, they turn to the state and its central bank. And the state, then, being offered another chance at its own enrichment, accepts and provides the banking system, and by extension the business establishment, with the needed liquidity by means of a new round of counterfeiting. The alliance is renewed, and the state has reaffirmed its dominant role by having saved the established banking and the industrial elite from crumbling in the face of economic competition and allowing them instead to preserve the status quo or even further increase the wealth already concentrated in their hands. There is reason to be thankful and to reciprocate with invigorated public support for the state and its propaganda.

To be sure, this coalition between the state and the economic power elite by no means implies a complete identity of interests. The various established industrial enterprises may have different or even contrary interests; and the same is true for the banks. Similarly, the interests of banks and business clients may in many respects be different. Nor do the interests of the industrial elite or the banks coincide completely with those of the state. For after all, banks as well as industrial enterprises are also in the “normal” business of making money through production and productive exchanges—whatever other sources of income acquisition may be available to them. And in this function their interests may well clash with the state’s desire for taxes, for instance. Nonetheless, the establishment of a system of monopolized money and banking still creates one interest common to all of them: an interest in the preservation of the state apparatus and the institution of political (i.e., exploitative) means of income appropriation as such. Not only could the state and its central bank destroy any commercial bank and, indirectly, practically any industrial enterprise; this threat is more severe the more established a business is. The state could also help any and all of them get richer, and more so if they are already rich. Hence, the more there is to lose from opposition and to gain from compliance, the more intensive will be the attempts by the economic power elite to infiltrate the state apparatus and have the state leaders assume financial interests in the business world. Bankers and industrialists become politicians; and politicians take positions in banking and industry. A social system emerges and is increasingly characteristic of the modern world in which the state and a closely associated class of banking and business leaders exploit everyone else.[^18][^19]

### International Politics and International Monetary Order

Man’s economic interests, i.e., his interests in improving his income and wealth by means of producing and exchanging, lead to the emergence of a universally used commodity money—gold—and a system of free banking.

Man’s political interests (i.e., his interests in improving his income and wealth through exploitation at the expense of producers and contractors) lead to the formation of states, the destruction of the gold standard and the monopolization of money and banking.

Yet once a state is established as a monopolist of exploitation and counterfeiting new problems emerge. For even if its monopolistic position is secured within a given territory, competition between states operating in different territories still exists. It is this competition which imposes severe limits on any one government’s exploitative powers. On one hand, it opens up the possibility that people will vote against a government with their feet and leave its territory if they perceive other territories as offering less exploitative living conditions. Or if other states are perceived as less oppressive, the likelihood increases of a state’s subjects collaborating with such foreign competitors in their desire to “take over.” Both of these possibilities pose a crucial problem for each state. For each literally lives off a population, and any population loss is thus a loss of potential state income. Similarly, any state’s interest in another’s internal affairs must be interpreted as a threat, in particular if it is supported by the latter’s own subjects, because in the business of exploitation one can only prosper as long as there is something that can be exploited and, obviously, any support given to another state would reduce what remains left over for itself.

On the other hand, with several competing states each individual state’s counterfeiting power becomes severely limited. In fact, on the international level a problem reemerges which is directly analogous to the obstacle to counterfeiting which was implied by a system of free banking, and which the states solved internally through the monopolization or cartelization of banking. The situation is characterized by different national paper monies with freely fluctuating exchange rates, If one state counterfeits more extensively than another, its currency is bound to depreciate in terms of the other, and for such a state this means (whatever different things it may mean for its various subjects) that its income has declined in relation to that of another state. With this its power vis-à-vis that of another state is decreased. It becomes more vulnerable to a competing state’s attacks (military or economic). Naturally, it is in no state’s interest to see this happen, and hence one’s counterfeiting desire must be restrained accordingly. Counterfeiting still continues permanently, of course, because it is in every state’s own interest; but no state is truly autonomous in its decision about how much to inflate and instead must at all times pay close attention to the inflationary policies of its competitors and flexibly adjust its own actions to theirs.

In order to maximize its exploitatively acquired income, it is in a state’s natural interest to overcome both of these external restrictions on internal power. Cartelization would seem a possible solution. However, it must fail as such because—due to the lack of a monopolistic enforcement agency—interstate cartels could only be voluntary and would hence appear less attractive to a state the more powerful it already is and the less inflationary its counterfeiting policy. By joining any such cartel a state would harm itself to the advantage of less successful and more inflationary states. There is only one stable solution for the problem then: A state must aim to expand its territory, eliminate its competitors and, as its ultimate goal, establish itself as a world government. And parallel to this must be its attempts to make its paper currency used in wider territories and ultimately make it the world currency under the control of its own world central bank. Only if these goals are achieved will a state come into its own. There are many obstacles on this path, and these may prove so severe as to make it necessary to settle for less than such a perfect solution. However, as long as there is a state in existence, such an interest is operative and must be understood as such if one is to correctly interpret past developments as well as future tendencies (after all it also took the states several centuries to reach their present internal counterfeiting powers!).

The means for accomplishing the first of its two integrated goals is war. War and state are inextricably connected.[^20] Not only is a state an exploitative firm and its leading representatives can thus have no principled objection to nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions—otherwise they would not do what they do or the state would simply fall apart and dissolve. And it cannot be surprising then that they should also have no fundamental objection to a territorial expansion of exploitation by means of war. In fact, war is the logical prerequisite of a later cease-fire: and its own internal, institutionalized system of exploitation is nothing but a—legitimate—cease-fire, i.e., the result of previous conquests. In addition, as the representatives of the state they are also in command of the very means which make it increasingly likely that one’s aggressive desires can actually be put into effect. In command of the instrument of taxation and, even better for this purpose, of absolute internal counterfeiting powers the state can let others pay for its wars. And naturally, if one does not have to pay for one’s risky ventures oneself but can force others to do so, or if one can simply create the needed funds out of thin air, one tends to be a greater risk-taker and more trigger-happy than one would otherwise be.

While independent of demand and hence by nature a more aggressive institution than any normal business that would have to finance its wars with income gained exclusively through voluntary transactions and that would thus face immediate financial repercussions if only a single one of its clients reduced his purchases in response to his dissatisfaction with this business’ war policy, the state is still not entirely free of all constraints in its pursuit of foreign aggression. Just as states emerge although there is no demand for them, so wars occur without having been demanded. But as the emergence and the growth of states is constrained by public opinion, so also are the state’s war endeavors. For obviously, in order to come out of an interstate war successfully, a state must be in command of sufficient—in relative terms—economic resources which alone make its actions sustainable. However these resources can only be provided by a productive population. Thus, to secure the means necessary to win wars and to avoid being confronted with slackening productive outputs while at war, public opinion again turns out to be the decisive variable constraining a state’s foreign policy. Only if popular support for the state’s war exists can it be sustained and possibly won. The support from the banking and business establishment can be won easily, provided the foreign aggression promises a successful end and its cost can be established with a sufficient degree of accuracy. Not everyone of this class will be ready to join in, of course, because one may have vested interests in the to-be-conquered territory that will be damaged in the event of an interstate conflict; or one may wish that country C rather than B would be attacked; or one may even in principle be opposed to war. Generally, the expectation that along with one’s own state’s victory the business and banking elite would become established as a ruling class over a larger territory, with correspondingly expanded possibilities for financial exploitation, is a most powerful reason for the economic—in particular the banking—elite to pay close attention to the war option.

Yet their support is by no means sufficient. In a war even more so than during peacetime a state is dependent on every single person’s willingness to work and produce (there can no longer be any loafers during wartime). To ensure widespread enthusiasm, all states must help create and support nationalistic ideologies. They have to wrap themselves up as nation states and pose as the banner carriers and protectors of the superior values of one’s own nation as distinct from those of others, in order to generate the public identification with one specific state which is necessary in order to then turn around and wipe out the independence of more and more distinct nations and separate ethnic, linguistic and cultural groups.

However, something more substantial is required in order to keep the population working and producing the resources needed for a war: After all, the other states assumedly have the support of their business elite; and they, too, have created a spirit of nationalism in their territories. Assuming further that the antagonistic states initially control populations of comparable size and territories with similar natural endowments, the decisive variable determining victory or defeat becomes the relative economic wealth of the societies involved, their relative degree of economic development and capital accumulation. Those states tend to be victorious in interstate warfare that can parasitically draw on superior economic wealth. Clearly though, in order to be in this position conditions relatively favorable to wealth and capital formation in their respective territories must previously have existed. States do not positively contribute to this. On the contrary, as institutions engaged in nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions, their very existence is destructive of wealth and capital accumulation. However, they can make a negative contribution. Wealth and capital comes into existence only through homesteading, producing and contracting, and a relatively lower degree of exploitation of homesteaders, producers and contractors means a relative boost to capital formation, which in the next round of exploitation can give the state the additional resources needed to succeed militarily over its foreign competitors. Thus, what is also required in order to win wars is a relatively high degree of internal liberalism.

Paradoxical as it may first seem, the more liberal[^21] a state is internally, the more likely it will engage in outward aggression. Internal liberalism makes a society richer; a richer society to extract from makes the state richer, and a richer state makes for more and more successful expansionist wars. And this tendency of richer states toward foreign intervention is still further strengthened, if they succeed in creating a “liberationist” nationalism among the public, i.e., the ideology that above all it is in the name and for the sake of the general public’s own internal liberties and its own relatively higher standards of living that war must be waged or foreign expeditions undertaken.

In fact, something still more specific can be stated about internal liberalism as a requirement and means for successful imperialism. The need for a productive economy that a warring state must have also explains why it is that *ceteris paribus* those states tend to outstrip their competitors in the arena of international politics which have adjusted their internal redistributive policies so as to decrease the importance of economic regulations relative to that of taxation. Regulations through which states either compel or prohibit certain exchanges between two or more private persons as well as taxation imply a nonproductive and/or noncontractual income expropriation and thus both damage homesteaders, producers or contractors. However, while by no means less destructive of productive output than taxation, regulations have the peculiar characteristic of requiring the state’s control over economic resources in order to become enforceable without simultaneously increasing the resources at its disposal. In practice, this is to say that they require the state’s command over taxes, yet they produce no monetary income for the state (instead, they satisfy pure power lust, as when A, for no material gain of his own, prohibits B and C from engaging in mutually beneficial trade). On the other hand, taxation and a redistribution of tax revenue according to the principle “from Peter to Paul,” increases the economic means at the government’s disposal at least by its own “handling charge” for the act of redistribution. Since a policy of taxation, and taxation without regulation, yields a higher monetary return to the state (and with this more resources expendable on the war effort!) than a policy of regulation, and regulation with taxation, states must move in the direction of a comparatively deregulated economy and a comparatively pure tax-state in order to avoid international defeat.[^22]

With the backdrop of these theoretical considerations about the nature of the state and international politics, much of history falls into place. Lasting over centuries, practically uninterrupted series of interstate wars vividly confirm what has been stated about the inherently aggressive nature of states. Similarly, history dramatically illustrates the tendency towards increased relative concentration of states as the outcome of such wars: States’ aggressive expansionism has led to the closing of all frontiers, and a steady decline in the number of states along with an equally steady increase in the territorial size of those states that managed to survive. No world state has yet been brought about, but a tendency in this direction is undeniably present. More specifically, history illuminates the central importance that internal liberalism has for imperial growth: First, the rise of the states of Western Europe to world prominence can be so explained. It is in Western Europe that, built on the older intellectual traditions of Greek and Stoic philosophy as well as Roman law, the ideology of natural rights and liberalism emerged.[^23] It was here that—associated with names such as St. Thomas Aquinas, Luis de Molina, Francisco Suarez and the late sixteenth century Spanish Scholastics, Hugo Grotius, Samuel Pufendorf, and John Locke—it increasingly gained influence in public opinion; and where the various states’ internal powers of exploitation were then correspondingly weakened. And their power was even further weakened by the fact that pre-modern Europe was characterized by a highly competitive, almost anarchic international system, with a multitude of rivaling small scale states and feudal principalities. It was in this situation that capitalism originated.[^24] Because the states were weak, homesteaders, producers and contractors increasingly began to accumulate capital; previously unheard of economic growth rates were registered; for the first time a steadily increasing population could be sustained; and, in particular with the population growth leveling off, gradually but continuously the general standard of living began to rise, finally leading to what is called the Industrial Revolution. Drawing on this superior wealth of capitalist societies the weak, liberal states of Western Europe became the richest states on earth. And this superior wealth in their hands then led to an outburst of imperialist ventures which for the first time in history established the European states as genuine world powers, extending their hegemonic rule across all continents.

Similarly, England’s outstanding role among the West European states can be explained. The most liberal country of all, the British government became the most successful imperialist.[^25] And the relative decline of England (and Western Europe) and the rise of the U.S. to the world’s foremost imperialist power fits the theoretical picture as well. With no feudal past to speak of and British imperialism defeated, liberalism was still more pronounced in the U.S. than anywhere in Europe. State power was at its weakest, hardly to be noticed in people’s daily activities. Accordingly, economic growth was higher than in all other countries; standards of living went up; the population increased; and living standards and population size gradually surpassed those of all West European countries. At the same time, beginning in the late nineteenth century England and Western Europe suffered from reinvigorated internal statism brought about by the emergence of socialist ideologies on the European scene. It was this superior economic wealth—produced by a little exploited civil society—which allowed the internally weak U.S. government apparatus to slowly become the richest, most resourceful state, and turn these resources toward foreign aggression and in time establish itself as the dominant world power, with “home bases” all around the globe and direct or indirect military dominance and hegemonic control over a large part of the world (with the exception of the Soviet Union and China and their respective satellites).[^26] The nineteenth century already displayed aggressive expansionism of the—liberal—U.S. government second to none. Since as early as 1801, when the U.S. Navy was sent on a punitive mission to the remote area around Tripolis, virtually no single year has passed without U.S. government intervention somewhere in the world.[^27] Three major wars were waged: Against England (1812); against Mexico (1846–48), in which Mexico lost half its territory; and against Spain (1898), which resulted in the United States’ occupation of Cuba and the Philippines. Contrary to popular myth, the Civil War, too, was essentially an expansionist war waged by the relatively more liberal North against the Confederate states. However, the great breakthrough to world dominance did not occur until the twentieth century, when the U.S. entered World Wars I and II. Both wars dramatically proved the superiority of U.S. might over the European states. The U.S. determined the victors as well as the losers, and both wars ended with a victory of the more liberal U.S. government—resting on a less taxed and regulated economy—over all of the more socialist-authoritarian European states (including the Soviet Union) with their more heavily taxed and regulated economies. With the end of World War II the U.S. had reached hegemony over Europe and, as heir to the European states’ foreign empires, over large territories all around the world. Since World War II the U.S. has continued and even intensified its unrivaled expansionism with smaller or larger military interventions in Greece, Iran, Korea, Guatemala, Indonesia, Lebanon, Laos, Cuba, the Congo, British Guiana, the Dominican Republic, Vietnam, Chile, Grenada, and Nicaragua.[^28]

Finally, history also provides the most vivid illustration of the direct link between a state’s internal powers of counterfeiting and its policy of external aggression, as well as the banking and business elite’s conspiracy with the state in its expansionist desires. The watershed mark in the process leading to the rise of the U.S. as the world’s premier power is World War I. The U.S. government could not have entered and successfully won this initially inner-European war without the absolute counterfeiting power that was achieved in 1913 with the establishment of the Federal Reserve System. It would have lacked the resources to do so. With a central banking system in place, a smooth transition to a war economy could be made and it became possible for the U.S. to get involved more deeply in the war and enlarge it to one of history’s most devastating wars. And just as the prior establishment of the Federal Reserve System had been enthusiastically supported by the banking establishment (in particular by the houses of Rockefeller, Morgan, and Kuhn, Loeb and Co.), so the U.S. policy of entering the war on the Allied side found its most ardent supporters among the economic elite (notably in the firm of J.P. Morgan and Co. as the fiscal agent of the Bank of England and monopoly underwriter of British and French bonds as well as a major arms producer, and represented within the Wilson administration by such powerful forces as W.G. McAdoo, secretary of the Treasury and Wilson’s son-in-law; Colonel P.M. House, Wilson’s intimate foreign policy adviser; and B. Strong, governor of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York).[^29]

There is only one important element still missing from a complete reconstruction of the present international order: money. It is in a state’s natural interest to expand its territory militarily; and hence, one should expect a tendency toward a relative concentration of states. It is also in a state’s interest to engage in “monetary imperialism” (i.e., to extend its counterfeiting power over larger territories); thus, a tendency toward a one-world paper currency should be expected. Both interests and tendencies complement each other. On the one hand, any step in the direction of an international counterfeiting cartel is bound to fail if it is not complemented by the establishment of military dominance and hierarchy. External and internal economic pressures would tend to burst the cartel. With military superiority, however, an inflation cartel becomes possible. On the other hand, once military dominance has made such a cartel possible, the dominant state can actually expand its exploitative power over other territories without further war and conquest. In fact, the international cartelization of counterfeiting allows the dominant state to pursue through more sophisticated (i.e., less visible) means what war and conquest alone might not be able to achieve.

In the first step a dominant state (a state, that is, which could crush another militarily and is perceived as capable of doing so, in particular by the dominated government) will use its superior power to enforce a policy of internationally coordinated inflation. Its own central bank sets the pace in the counterfeiting process, and the central banks of dominated states are ordered to inflate along with the dominating state. In practical terms, the dominating state’s paper currency is imposed as a reserve currency on foreign central banks, and they are pressured to use it as a basis for their own inflationary actions.

Constrained not by actual demand but only by public opinion, it is relatively easy for a dominant state to accomplish this goal. Direct territorial conquest and the direct implementation of its own currency in foreign territories can be prohibitive because of the state of national or foreign public opinion. Yet with the power to destroy any specific foreign government—even thought it is not strong enough for a complete take-over—little is required in order for the dominant state to succeed in *monetary* imperialism.

Internally, it will most likely encounter no resistance whatsoever. The government itself will be satisfied with this solution. For once its own currency is employed as a reserve currency by foreign banks on which they then pyramid their various national paper monies, then it becomes possible for it to engage in an almost costless expropriation of foreign property owners and income producers without having to fear contractive consequences. Similarly, its own banking and business elite is ready to accept such an arrangement, because they, too, can thereby safely participate in foreign exploitation. Banks in particular are enthusiastic. And the public is largely ignorant of what is happening, or considers the exploitation of foreigners minor as compared to internal problems.

Externally, matters are only slightly more complicated. The dominated state loses resources to the dominating one as a consequence of monetary regime. But faced with the possibility of losing its internal control altogether, it naturally prefers acquiescing to a scheme which not only allows it to stay in power but to actually continue in its own fraudulent expropriations of its own population by inflating its currency on top of and in accordance with the dominating state’s paper money creation. For essentially the same reason bank and business elites, as the first receivers of their respective state’s counterfeit money, are willing to accept this solution. And the general public in the dominated territories, which through arrangement is subject to a double layer of exploitation of foreign states’ elites on top of a national state and elite, is again largely unaware of all this and fails to identify it as one important cause of its own prolonged economic dependency and relative stagnation vis-à-vis the dominant nation.

This first step, however, does not provide a perfect solution. The international monetary system is characterized by a dominant paper currency, and a multitude of national paper monies pyramiding on top of it, and freely fluctuating exchange rates between such currencies.

On one hand, this is less than satisfactory for the dominant state, because under these circumstances ample room is left for the possibility of its own currency depreciating against others, and such a development would pose a threat to its own role as a dominant power. For exchange rates are not exclusively determined by the inflationary policies of various central banks. Ultimately and *ceteris paribus*, they are determined by purchasing power parity.[^30] And even if a dominated central bank willingly inflates along with the dominating central bank, other factors (such as a lower level of taxation and regulation, for instance) can still make its currency appreciate against that of the dominant state.

On the other hand, the existence of a multitude of currencies freely fluctuating against each other is, as explained earlier, dysfunctional of the very purpose of money. It is a system of partial barter. It creates informational chaos, makes rational economic calculation impossible, accordingly leads to inefficiencies within the very system of production which the dominant state parasitically rests.

Thus, in order to assure its dominant position and maximize exploitatively appropriated income, in a second step a dominant state will invariably try to institute an international—and ultimately universal—currency monopolistically controlled and issued either directly by its own central bank or indirectly by an international or world bank dominated by its central bank.

There are some obstacles on the way to this goal. However, once the first step has been completed successfully, none of them would seem insurmountable. Naturally, the dominated state would lose some discretionary power under this arrangement. But this would be compensated for by the fact that its own economy would function more efficiently, too, if calculational chaos in international trade were reduced. Further, the banking and business elite in both countries would be adamantly in favor of such a monetary regime and would use their close ties to their respective state and international connections to promote its adoption. For, after all, banks and industrial firms are also in the business of making money through production and exchanges. Freely fluctuating exchange rates are an artificial impediment in their pursuit of this economic interest. And they will be perceived as dysfunctional more intensively by larger businesses, because it is big business, in particular, for which foreign trade plays a more important role.

In fact, the most severe resistance to the adoption of an international currency is to be expected not from the states and the economic elites, but from the general public. Insofar as an international currency implies giving up an accustomed one, it runs against the very nationalism that all states eagerly bred for so long. This would be a problem especially if the public in the dominated countries were asked to adopt the dominant state’s currency directly—name and all—because the underlying imperialist nature of such a monetary system would then become dangerously apparent. Yet with some degree of diplomacy and patient propaganda, this problem seems solvable, too. A new currency with a new name must be created and defined in terms of existing national monies in order not to arouse nationalistic or anti-imperialist sentiments. This new currency must only be somewhat overvalued against the various national monies (which in turn are defined in terms of the new currency) in order to drive all national monies out of circulation (in accordance with Gresham’s law).[^31] This must be accompanied by the states’ and the economic elites’ constant appeal to the general public’s sound economic intuition that—regardless of all nationalistic feelings—freely fluctuating national monies are an anachronistic institution which cripples rational economic calculation, and that it is in everyone’s best interest to have an internationally (and if possible universally) used money such as the international banking system under the leadership of the dominant state’s central bank is willing to provide. Barring any drastic change in public opinion in the direction of a strengthened private property and sound money orientation and a correspondingly increased antistate vigilance, nothing will prevent the dominant state from achieving this complete international counterfeiting autonomy. And with a world money and world bank in place, and controlled by the dominant state’s central bank, a decisive step is taken toward reaching its ultimate goal of establishing itself as a full-scale world government, with world-wide control not only over counterfeiting, but also over taxation and legal regulation.

In light of this explanation of monetary imperialism and its function as a “natural” (from a statist viewpoint, that is) complement of military expansionism, the remaining pieces from the history of international politics fall into place. Hand in hand with the rise of Great Britain to the rank of the foremost imperialist nation state went a sterling imperialism. Not entirely free at the time of all internal obstacles in the way of counterfeiting, British-dominated countries were compelled to keep their reserves in the form of sterling balances in London, where the Bank of England would redeem them in gold. This way, these countries would pyramid their national currencies on top of the pound, and Britain could inflate sterling notes on top of gold without having to fear an outflow of gold. With Britain’s decline and the concurrent rise of the U.S. government to the position of the world’s leading military power, sterling imperialism has gradually been replaced by a dollar imperialism. At the end of World War II, with U.S. domination extended over most of the globe, and essentially ratified in the Bretton Woods agreement, the dollar became the world reserve currency on top of which all other states have inflated their various national paper monies.[^32] For a while, the U.S. officially still maintained the pretense of redeeming foreign central banks’ dollars in gold, and this somewhat limited its own inflationary potential. However, it did not prevent steady dollar counterfeiting on top of gold from occurring. The position of the U.S. as a militarily dominant international power (in the meantime formalized through a number of military pacts, most notably the NATO) allowed it to compel foreign governments to exercise their right to ask for redemption only sparingly if at all, so that its own dollar inflation could take place without setting off contractive consequences. And when its counterfeiting policy had incited foreign governments to become all too daring in their attempts to obtain gold at bargain prices, it was the U.S. government’s superior military might that finally allowed it to give up all pretense and declare its notes irredeemable. Since then the Federal Reserve System has acquired the position of an autonomous counterfeiter of last resort to the entire international banking system.[^33]

The imperialist nature of this dollar standard takes effect in particular through such instruments as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the Bank for International Settlement (BIS).[^34] Money and credit, created by the strike of a pen, is passed from these U.S.-dominated institutions first to foreign governments which inflate their national currencies on top of it and in turn pass this money on to their own cartelized banking system which, adding a further dose of counterfeiting, then hand it on to the various states’ favorite business establishments whence it ripples to the economic periphery. Parallel to this flow of money goes a reversed process of income and wealth redistribution from the periphery onto national business and banking elites and the various nation states as well as from the dominated territories to the U.S. government and the U.S. banking and business establishment as the ultimate center of world finance.

From a sociological point of view, the consequences are particularly interesting if these two integrated processes are superimposed on pre-modern, feudal societies. Such countries, primarily in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, are typically characterized by a class of feudal landlords, or feudal landlords-turned-financial-orindustrial-magnates controlling the state apparatus and mostly residing in the capital-city-and-seat-of-government; and by a class of largely landless, dependent peasants dispersed over the countryside and sustaining the state, the feudal elite, and the capital city through the payment of land rents.[^35] Dollar imperialism here means upholding feudal rule, supporting and participating in the exploitation of an impoverished peasantry and the countryside by a parasitic feudal caste and the capital city, and contributing in the latter’s suppression of any liberationist land reform movement. In fact, the typical Third World cycle of ruthless government oppression, revolutionary movements, civil war, renewed suppression, and prolonged economic dependency and mass poverty is to a significant extent caused and maintained by the U.S.-dominated international monetary system.

Since 1971, in particular, increased efforts have been undertaken in the direction of the second step in the process of monetary expansionism. Not all of the roughly 160 freely fluctuating currencies actually pose a problem, because most of them are in no danger for internal reasons of appreciating against the dollar and thereby strengthening the respective states’ power vis-à-vis that of the U.S. government, or they play such a minor role in international trade that the calculational chaos which is introduced by their existence is largely insignificant. However, because of the relative strength of their currencies and their important role in international trade, the major West European states as well as Japan are a problem. Hence it is to these states and currencies in particular that U.S-led attempts to create a world currency that helps rationalize economic calculation and at the same time safeguard U.S. domination and further increase its own inflationary powers have been directed. The creation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), defined initially in terms of sixteen and later five leading export nations, and issued by the IMF, was a move toward a one-world currency and a one-world bank under U.S. domination.[^36] Another important push toward this goal was provided through the activities of the Trilateral Commission (TC), founded in 1973 as an offshoot of David Rockefeller’s Council on Foreign Relations. Composed of some 300 highly influential politicians, bankers, businessmen, as well as intellectuals and journalists from North America, Western Europe and Japan, the TC has made the establishment of a world paper currency and a world central bank its primary concern.[^37] Fervently supported by the TC as an intermediate step toward this ultimate goal as well as by several other politicianbanker-industrialist associations with a substantial overlap of membership with the TC and devoted to the same ends, such as the Action Committee for Europe, the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe, the Banking Federation of the European Community, the ECU Banking Association, the Basel Committee and the Wilton Park Group, great advances have been made in aligning the European monetary front. In 1979, the newly created European Currency Unit (ECU), issued under the aegis of the European Economic Community, first appeared. Defined as a weighted average of ten European currencies, and assisted by organizations such as the European Monetary System, the European Investment Bank, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, and the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, the ECU has assumed a more and more important rule. Since as an average it is less volatile than the various national currencies, multinational banks and corporations in particular have found it increasingly attractive to use the ECU as a unit of account and a medium of settlement: economic calculation is less haphazard with only three currencies—the ECU, the yen, and the dollar—than with a dozen. In 1998, according to official intergovernmental agreements, the European Central Bank was established and the ECU became the all-European currency supplanting all national monies.[^38]

With the European calculational chaos solved, then, and in particular with the European hard currency countries neutralized and weakened within a cartel that by its very nature favors more against less inflationary countries so as to protect and prolong U.S. hegemony over Europe, little indeed would remain to be done. With essentially only three central banks and currencies and U.S. dominance over Europe and Japan, the most likely candidates to be chosen as a U.S-dominated World Central Bank are the IMP or the BIS: and under its aegis then, initially defined as a basket of the dollar, the ECU, and the yen, the “phoenix” (or whatever else its name may be) will rise as a one-world paper currency—unless, that is, public opinion as the only constraint on government growth undergoes a substantial change and the public begins to understand the lesson explained in this book: that economic rationality as well as justice and morality demand a worldwide gold standard and free, 100-percentreserve banking as well as free markets worldwide; and that world government, a world central bank and a world paper currency—contrary to the deceptive impression of representing universal values—actually means the universalization and intensification of exploitation, counterfeiting-fraud and economic destruction.[^39]

[^8]: What about cartels? Could not the competing banks form a cartel and agree on a joint venture in counterfeiting? Again, under free banking this is most unlikely, because a system of free banking is characterized by the complete absence of any economic incentive for cartelization. With no restrictions of entry in existence, any such bank cartel would have to be classified as voluntary and would suffer from the same problems as any voluntary cartel: Faced with the threat of noncartelists and/or new entrants, and recognizing that like all cartel agreements, a banking cartel would favor the less efficient cartel members at the expense of the more efficient ones, there is simply no economic basis for successful action, and any attempt to cartelize would quickly break down as economically inefficient. Moreover, insofar as the counterfeit money would be employed to expand credit, banks acting in concert would set off a full-scale boom-bust cycle. This, too, would deter cartelization. See on the theory of free banking Mises, *Human Action*, pp. 434–48; Rothbard, *The Mystery of Banking*, chap. VIII.

[^9]: Contrary to the claim of the public choice school, states and private firms are not doing essentially the same sort of business, but instead are engaged in categorically different types of operations. Both types of institutions are the outcome of different, antagonistic interests. The “political” interest in exploitation and expropriation underlying the formation of states obviously requires and presupposes the existence of wealth, and hence an “economic” interest of at least one person in producing such wealth in the first place (while the reverse is not true). But at the same time, the more pronounced and successful political interests are, the more destructive of economic interests this will be. The public choice school is perfectly correct in pointing out that everyone—a government employee no less than an employee of an economic firm—normally prefers a higher to a lower income and that this interest explains why government should be expected to have no less of a tendency to grow than any other enterprise.

However, this discovery—that politicians and bureaucrats are no more altruistic or concerned about the public good than are people in other walks of life—is hardly new even if it has sometimes been overlooked. Yet what is in fact new with public choice is the inference drawn from this correct insight then, that all institutions should hence be regarded as an outgrowth of identical motivational forces and be treated analytically on a par with each other—is false to the point of being ridiculous. Regardless of a person’s subjective beliefs, integrating one’s actions into the institutional framework of either the state or a “normal” economic enterprise and pursuing one’s wealth maximizing interests here or there will in fact produce categorically different outcomes. On a representative statement of the public choice school regarding the idea of the “state as a firm” and of “political exchange” as essentially the same as economic exchange, see James Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, *The Calculus of Consent* (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1965), p. 19; for a critique of this view and the fundamental difference between economic and political means, see Franz Oppenheimer, *The State* (New York: Vanguard Press, 1914), pp. 24–27; Murray N.

[^18]: In the Marxist tradition this stage of social development is termed “monopoly capitalism,” “finance capitalism,” or “state monopoly capitalism.”

The descriptive part of Marxist analyses is generally valuable. In unearthing the close personal and financial links between state and business, they usually paint a much more realistic picture of the present economic order than do the mostly starry-eyed “bourgeois economists.” Analytically, however, they get almost everything wrong and turn the truth upside down.

The traditional, correct pre-Marxist view on exploitation was that of radical laissez-faire liberalism as espoused by, for instance, Charles Comte and Charles Dunoyer. According to them, antagonistic interests do not exist between capitalists as owners of factors of production and laborers, but between, on the one hand, the producers in society, i.e., homesteaders, producers and contractors, including businessmen as *well* as workers, and on the other hand, those who acquire wealth nonproductively and/or noncontractually, i.e., the state and stateprivileged groups, such as feudal landlords. This distinction was first confused by Saint-Simon, who had at some time been influenced by Comte and Dunoyer, and who classified market businessmen along with feudal lords and other stateprivileged groups as exploiters. Marx took up this confusion from Saint-Simon and compounded it by making only capitalists exploiters and all workers exploited, justifying this view through a Ricardian labor theory of value and his theory of surplus value. Essentially, this view on exploitation has remained typical for Marxism to this day despite Böhm-Bawerk’s smashing refutation of Marx’s exploitation theory and his explanation of the difference between factor prices and output prices through time preference (interest). To this day, whenever Marxist theorists talk about the exploitative character of monopoly capitalism, they see the root cause of this in the continued existence of the private ownership of means of production. Even if they admit a certain degree of independence of the state apparatus from the class of monopoly capitalists (as in the version of “state monopoly capitalism”), for them it is not the state that makes capitalist exploitation possible; rather it is the fact that the state is an agency of capitalism, an organization that transforms the narrow-minded interests of individual capitalists into the interest of an ideal universal capitalist (the *ideelle Gesamtkapitalist*), which explains the existence of exploitation.

In fact, as explained, the truth is precisely the opposite: It is the state that by its very nature is an exploitative organization, and capitalists can engage in exploitation only insofar as they stop being capitalists and instead join forces with the state. Rather than speaking of state monopoly capitalism, then, it would be more appropriate to call the present system “state financed monopoly socialism,” or “bourgeois socialism.”

Lenin, *Imperialism Last Stage of Capitalism* (Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, 1947); Paul M.

Rothbard, “Left and Right” in *Egalitarianism As a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays* (Washington, D.C.: Libertarian Review Press, 1974); on the refutation of the Marxist theory of exploitation, see Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, *Karl Marx and the Close of His System*, ed. Paul M. Sweezy, (New York: Augustus M. Kelley, 1948).

[^19]: To recognize the far-reaching integration of state interests and those of the economic power elite, which is brought about by the monopolization of money and banking, is not to say that there cannot be conflicts arising within this coalition. As mentioned earlier, the state is also characterized, for instance, by the necessity of democratizing its constitution. And the democratic process could well bring egalitarian or populist sentiments to the surface which were opposed to the state’s favorable treatment of banks and big business. However, it is precisely the financial nature of the state-business connection that makes such an occurrence unlikely. For not only would this pose an immediate threat to the economic power elite; it would also imply severe financial losses in state income, even if it did not threaten the stability of the state as such. Hence a powerful incentive exists for both sides to join forces in filtering any such sentiment out of the political process before it ever becomes widely heard and to ensure with all resources at their command that the range of political alternatives admitted to public discussion is so restricted as to systematically exclude any scrutinizing of their joint counterfeiting racket.
