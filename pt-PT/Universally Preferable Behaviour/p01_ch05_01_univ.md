## Comportamento Universalmente Preferível

Como resultado dos argumentos anteriores, podemos ver que é impossível entrar em qualquer debate sem aceitar a premissa de que certos comportamentos são *universalmente preferíveis*.

Aqui uso a palavra "comportamento", em vez de "pensamento", porque é importante diferenciar entre estados puramente internos e não verificáveis, como "pensamento", de estados objectivos e verificáveis, como "agir", "escrever" e "falar"

É impossível provar que sonhei com um elefante ontem à noite. É possível provar que escrevi a palavra "elefante", e é por isso que uso a palavra "comportamento" em vez de "pensamento"

Concordar com a lógica superior num argumento é uma* acção*. Se, sempre que tivesse que lhe conceder um ponto, não dissesse nada e ficasse apenas a olhar para si, acharia bastante irritante discutir comigo. Para conceder um ponto, devo realizar a acção da aquiescência verbal.

Assim, podemos ver que, inerente ao próprio acto de argumentar existe uma série de premissas interligadas que não podem ser destruídas.

Se lhe peço que me encontre no campo de ténis e apareço com um rifle de caça, podemos acabar praticando um desporto, mas certamente não será ténis. When I ask you to meet me on the tennis court for a game, implicit in that request is an acceptance of the rules of tennis.

Historically, those engaged in ethical debating have often failed to maintain this basic reality.

I cannot submit a scientific paper written in my own personal language, claiming that it has been refereed by my psychic goldfish, and expect to be taken seriously. Similarly, I cannot start a philosophical debate on ethics with reference to my own personal values, and claim that my arguments have all been validated by Trixie the omniscient and invisible leprechaun, and expect to be taken seriously.

The very act of debating requires an acceptance of universally preferable behaviour (UPB). There is no way to rationally respond to an ethical argument *without* exhibiting UPB.

Let us now turn to a series of positive proofs for UPB.

### UPB And Validity

One of the central challenges faced by modern philosophers is the need to prove that moral rules are both possible and universal. Until moral rules can be subjected to the same rigour and logic as any other propositions, we will forever be stymied by subjectivism, political prejudices and the pragmatic “argument from effect.”

The closest historical analogy to our present situation occurred in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, during the rise of the scientific method. The early pioneers who advocated a rational and empirical approach to knowledge faced the same prejudices that we face today – all the same irrationalities, entrenched powers of church and state, mystical and subjective “absolutes” and early educational barriers. Those who advocated the primacy of rationality and empirical observation over Biblical fundamentalism and secular tyrannies faced the determined opposition of those wielding both cross and sword. Many were tortured to death for their intellectual honesty – we face far less risk, and so should be far more courageous in advocating what is *true* over what is *believed*.

In order to attack false moralities, we must start from the beginning, just as the first scientists did. Francis Bacon did not argue that the scientific method was more “efficient” than prayer, Bible texts or starvation-induced visions. He simply said that if we want to understand nature, we must observe nature and theorise logically – and that there is *no other* route to knowledge.

We must take the same approach in defining and communicating *morality*. We must begin using the power and legitimacy of the scientific method to prove the validity and universality of moral laws. We must start from the beginning, build logically and reject *any* irrational or non-empirical substitutes for the truth.

What does this look like in practice? All we have to do is establish the following axioms:

- Morality is a valid concept.
- Moral rules must be consistent for all mankind.
- The validity of a moral theory is judged by its consistency.

To start from the very beginning… are moral rules – or universally preferable human behaviours – valid at all?

There are only two possibilities when it comes to moral rules, just as there are in any logical science. Either universal moral rules are valid, or they are not.[^6]

A rule can be valid if it *exists empirically*, like gravity, or because it is *true*, like the equation two plus two equals four.

We must then first ask: do moral rules exist at all?

Certainly not in material reality, which does not contain or obey a single moral rule. Moral rules are different from the rules of physics, just as the scientific method is different from gravity. Matter innately obeys gravity or the second law of thermodynamics, but “thou shalt not murder” is nowhere inscribed in the nature of things. Physical laws *describe* the behaviour of matter, but do not contain a single *prescription*. Science says that matter *does* behave in a certain manner – never that it *should* behave in a certain manner. A theory of gravity proves that if you push a man off a cliff, he will fall. It will not tell you whether you *should* push him or not.

Thus it cannot be said that moral rules exist in material reality, and neither are they automatically obeyed like the laws of physics – which does *not* mean that moral laws are false, subjective or irrelevant. The scientific method itself does not exist in reality either – and is also optional – but it is not at all false, subjective or irrelevant.

If we can prove that moral theories can be objective, rational and verifiable, this will provide the same benefits to ethics that subjecting *physical* theories to the scientific method did.

Before the rise of the scientific method, people believed that matter obeyed the subjective whims of gods and devils – and people believe the same of morality now. Volcanoes erupted because the mountain-god was angry; good harvests resulted from human or animal sacrifices. No one believed that absolute physical laws could limit the will of the gods – and so science could never develop. Those who historically profited from defining physical reality as subjective – mostly priests and aristocrats – fought the subjugation of physical theories to the scientific method, just as those who currently profit from defining morality as subjective – mostly priests and politicians – currently fight the subjugation of *moral* theories to objective and universal principles.

As mentioned above, the scientific method is essentially a methodology for separating accurate from inaccurate theories by subjecting them to two central tests: logical consistency and empirical observation – and by always subjugating logical consistency to empirical observation. If I propose a perfectly consistent and logical theory that says that a rock will float *up* when thrown off a cliff, any empirical test proves my theory incorrect, since observation always trumps hypothesis.

A further aspect of the scientific method is the belief that, since matter is composed of combinations of atoms with common, stable and predictable properties, the behaviour of matter must also be common, stable and predictable. Thus experiments must be *reproducible* in different locations and times. I cannot say that my “rock floating” theory is correct for just one particular rock, or on the day I first tested it, or at a single location. My theories must describe the behaviour of *matter*, which is universal, common, stable and predictable.

Finally, there is a generally accepted rule – sometimes called Occam’s Razor – which states that, of any two theories that have the same predictive power, the simpler of the two is preferable. Prior to the Copernican revolution, when Earth was considered the centre of the universe, the retrograde motion of Mars when Earth passed it in orbit around the sun caused enormous problems to the Ptolemaic system of astronomical calculations. “Circles within circles” multiplied enormously, which were all cleared away by simply placing the sun at the centre of the solar system and accepting the elliptical nature of planetary orbits.

Thus any valid scientific theory must be (a) universal (b) logical (c) empirically verifiable (d) reproducible and (e) as simple as possible.

The methodology for judging and proving a *moral* theory is exactly the same as the methodology for judging and proving any other theory.

#### Moral Rules: A Definition

The first question regarding moral rules is: *what* are they?

Simply put, *morals* are a set of rules claiming to accurately and consistently identify universally preferable human behaviours, just as *physics* is a set of rules claiming to accurately and consistently identify the universal behaviour of matter.

The second question to be asked is: is there any such thing as “universally preferable behaviour” at all? If there is, we can begin to explore what such behaviour might be. If not, then our examination must stop here – just as the examination of Ptolemaic astronomy ceased after it became commonly accepted that the Sun was in fact the centre of the solar system.

[^6]: In physics, the question is: either universal physical rules are valid, or they are not.
