# Apêndices

## Apêndice A: UPB resumidamente

Por favor, encontre abaixo um sumário do argumento principal para a moralidade.

1. Reality is objective and consistent.
2. “Logic” is the set of objective and consistent rules derived from the consistency of reality.
3. Those theories that conform to logic are called “valid.”
4. Those theories that are confirmed by empirical testing are called “accurate.”
5. Those theories that are both valid and accurate are called “true.”
6. “Preferences” are required for life, thought, language and debating.
7. Debating requires that both parties hold “truth” to be both objective and universally preferable.
8. Thus the very act of debating contains an acceptance of universally preferable behaviour (UPB).
9. Theories regarding UPB must pass the tests of logical consistency and empirical verification.
10. The subset of UPB that examines enforceable behaviour is called “morality.”
11. As a subset of UPB, no moral theory can be considered true if it is illogical or unsupported by empirical evidence.
12. Moral theories that are supported by logic and evidence are true. All other moral theories are false.

## Appendix B: Moral Categories

Below is a sample table that lists some of the most common categories of actions/rules, and their key differentiators.

## Appendix D: Every UPB Debate I've Ever Had...

**UPB Sceptic**: UPB is invalid. **Me**: How do you know? **UPB Sceptic**: It's not proven! **Me**: So “proof” is UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No, nothing is UPB. **Me**: Isn't the statement "nothing is UPB" UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No, that's not what I'm saying at all! I'm saying that UPB is invalid! **Me**: Why? **UPB Sceptic**: Because it's false! **Me**: So presenting true arguments is UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No! **Me**: So there's nothing wrong with false arguments? **UPB Sceptic**: No. **Me**: Then why are you opposing a false argument? **UPB Sceptic**: Oh, it's just my personal preference. I just dislike falsehood. **Me**: So you're arguing for a merely personal preference? **UPB Sceptic**: Sure! **Me**: So why should your personal preference take precedence over mine? I like UPB, you don't – and why bother debating personal preferences at all? **UPB Sceptic**: Oh - because UPB is invalid! **Me**: Why is it invalid? **UPB Sceptic**: Because it's self-contradictory! **Me**: So consistency is UPB? **UPB Sceptic**: No! And stop repeating the same points over and over! And go read Kant / Hegel / Hume etc.
