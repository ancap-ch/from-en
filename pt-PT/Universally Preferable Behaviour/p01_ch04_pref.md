## Preferências

Agora que entendemos a natureza dos argumentos auto-destrutivos, podemos passar à questão das preferências.

As preferências são fundamentais para qualquer metodologia que pretenda definir o valor da verdade das proposições. O método científico, por exemplo, é amplamente definido por preferências inatas, para a consistência lógica e a verificação empírica. Para a ciência, a premissa é: *se* quiser determinar uma verdade válida sobre o comportamento da matéria e da energia, é *preferível* usar o método científico.

Neste sentido, "preferível" não significa "tipo de melhor", mas sim "obrigatório". *Se* quiser viver, é *universalmente preferível* que se abstenha de comer um punhado de arsénico. *Se* desejar determinar verdades válidas sobre a realidade, é * universalmente preferível* que as suas teorias sejam internamente consistentes e empiricamente verificáveis. "Universalmente preferível", então, traduz-se para "objectivamente necessário", mas manteremos a palavra "preferível" para diferenciar entre absolutos humanos opcionais e absolutos físicos não-opcionais, como a gravidade.

De igual modo, se as teorias éticas puderem ser válidas, então elas devem ser *pelo menos* interna e externamente consistentes. Por outras palavras, uma teoria ética que se contradiga não pode ser válida - e uma teoria ética que contradiga evidências empíricas e preferências quase universais, também não pode ser válida.

Assim, na ética, como na ciência, na matemática, na engenharia e em todas as outras disciplinas que comparam as teorias com a realidade,* as teorias válidas devem ser logicamente consistentes e empiricamente verificáveis*.

### Preferências e Existência

Se eu disser "eu gosto de sorvete", apenas uma palavra permanece ambígua nessa frase. Claramente, "eu" existe, já que estou expressando uma preferência pessoal. Igualmente claramente, o "sorvete" também existe na realidade. No entanto, a palavra "gosto" é mais problemática.

As preferências não existem objectivamente dentro da realidade. Se você fosse obsessivamente curioso, talvez me pudesse acompanhar e gravar cada vez que eu comia sorvete, o que provavelmente forneceria uma boa base empírica para estabelecer a minha preferência por ele. Contudo, poderia existir a possibilidade de que eu fosse de facto um masoquista, e não gostasse mesmo nada, de sorvete e preferisse me torturar com o seu sabor desagradável - e depois confundi-lo, alegando gostar disso.

Podemos encontrar *evidências* para preferências; não podemos encontrar, realmente *a própria* preferência. A preferência existe como uma *relação* entre a consciência e a matéria, assim como a gravidade existe como uma relação entre corpos de matéria.

Deixando de lado as questões desafiadoras do livre arbítrio contra o determinismo, é lógico supor que seja o que for que uma pessoa esteja a fazer no presente, é o que ela "prefere" fazer. Se eu me levantar e for trabalhar, então obviamente *prefiro* para fazer isso, em vez de qualquer outra alternativa. Even if I hate my job, I clearly hate it *less* than, say, being penniless.

Given that human beings can perform a near infinite variety of actions, whatever a person is doing in the moment is chosen out of all other possible options. I am choosing to write this book rather than, say, learning how to tango.

When we apply this simple fact to ethical arguments, we come up with some very interesting results.

### Preferences And Arguments

Remembering our above analysis of self-defeating arguments, we can easily understand the contradictory nature of the statement: “preferences do not exist.” Given that every human action – including making philosophical statements – is chosen in preference to every other possible action, arguing that preferences do not exist requires a *preference* for arguing that preferences do not exist, which is a self-contradictory statement. Arguing that preferences do not exist is exactly the same as arguing that language does not exist. It is an utterly self-defeating argument.

Since it is impossible to act without expressing a preference – either implicitly or explicitly – anyone who acts accepts the premise that preferences exist. Thus it is impossible to debate the existence of preferences without accepting the existence of preferences.

### Preferences And Universality

The next question thus becomes: are preferences purely subjective, or can they be universal?

Clearly, some preferences are subjective. Musical tastes, personal hobbies, favourite literature and so on are all subjective and personal preferences.

The challenge arises when we try to define some preferences as *objective*.

The proposition before us is thus: *can some preferences be objective, i.e. universal?*

When I say that some preferences may be objective, I do not mean that all people follow these preferences at all times. If I were to argue that *breathing* is an objective preference, I could be easily countered by the example of those who commit suicide by hanging themselves. If I were to argue that eating is an objective preference, my argument could be countered with examples of hunger strikes and anorexia.

Thus when I talk about universal preferences, I am talking about what people *should* prefer, not what they always *do* prefer. To use a scientific analogy, to truly understand the universe, people *should* use the scientific method – this does not mean that they always do so, since clearly billions of people consult ancient fairy tales rather than modern science for “answers.” There is no way to achieve truth about the universe without science, but people are perfectly free to redefine “truth” as “error,” and content themselves with mystical nonsense.

Likewise, if a man wants to cure an infection, he *should* take antibiotics rather than perform an Aztec rain dance. The preference for taking antibiotics rather than doing a rain dance is universal, since dancing cannot cure infections. Thus, although there is the occasional madman who will try to cure himself through dancing, it is still *universally preferable* that if a man wants to cure himself, he must take antibiotics.

In other words, if you want to get to the top of a mountain, wishing for it will never work. If you want to know the origins of the universe, prayer will never provide an answer. People still wish, and pray, but that does not make wishing or praying any more effective. With that in mind, let us turn to the question of whether or not universal preferences can be valid.

### Arguments And Universality

If I choose to debate, I have implicitly accepted a wide variety of premises that are worth spending some time to unpack here.

#### Premise 1: We Both Exist

If I choose to debate with you, then I necessarily must accept that we both exist. If believe that I exist, but you do not, then debating makes no sense, and would be the action of a madman. If I were to start arguing with my reflection in a mirror, I should be sedated, not debated.

#### Premise 2: The Senses Have The Capacity For Accuracy

Since human beings cannot communicate psychically, all debates necessarily involve the evidence of the senses. Writing presupposes sight; talking requires hearing; Braille requires touch. Thus any proposition that depends upon the invalidity of the senses automatically self-destructs.

#### Premise 3: Language Has The Capacity For Meaning

Similar to Premise Two, since all arguments require language, any proposition that rests on the premise that language is meaningless is immediately disproven. Using language to argue that language has no meaning is like using a courier to send a message arguing that couriers never deliver messages.

#### Premise 4: Correction Requires Universal Preferences

If you correct me on an error that I have made, you are implicitly accepting the fact that it would be *better* for me to correct my error. Your preference for me to correct my error is not subjective, but objective, and universal.

You don’t say to me: “You should change your opinion to mine because I would prefer it,” but rather: “You should correct your opinion because it is objectively incorrect.” My error does not arise from merely disagreeing with you, but as a result of my deviance from an objective standard of truth. Your argument that I should correct my false opinion rests on the objective value of truth – i.e. that truth is *universally preferable* to error, and that truth is *universally objective*.

#### Premise 5: An Objective Methodology Exists For Separating Truth From Falsehood

If you disagree with me, but I tell you that you must agree with me because I am always right, it is unlikely that you would be satisfied by the rigour of my argument. If you provided good reasons as to why I was wrong, but I just kept repeating that I was right because I am *always* right, our interaction could scarcely be categorised as a debate.

The moment that I provide some sort of objective criterion for determining truth from falsehood, I am accepting that truth is more than a matter of opinion.

This does not necessarily mean that my objective criteria are *logical* – I could refer you to a religious text, for example. However, even if I do so, I am still accepting that the truth is something that is arrived at independent of mere personal assertion – that an objective methodology exists for separating truth from falsehood.

#### Premise 6: Truth Is Better Than Falsehood

If I tell you that the world is flat, and you reply that the world is not flat, but round, then you are implicitly accepting the axiom that truth and falsehood both exist objectively, and that truth is better than falsehood.

If I tell you that I like chocolate ice cream, and you tell me that you like vanilla, it is impossible to “prove” that vanilla is objectively better than chocolate. The moment that you correct me with reference to objective *facts*, you are accepting that objective facts exist, and that objective truth is *universally preferable* to subjective error.

#### Premise 7: Peaceful Debating Is The Best Way To Resolve Disputes

If I tell you that the world is flat, and you pull out a gun and shoot me, this would scarcely be an example of a productive debate. True, our disagreement would have been “resolved” – but because only one of us was left standing at the end.

If you told me in advance that you would deal with any disagreement by shooting me, I would be unlikely to engage in a debate with you. Thus it is clear that any debate relies on the implicit premise that evidence, reason, truth and objectivity are the *universally preferable* methods of resolving disputes between individuals. It would be completely illogical to argue that differences of opinion should be resolved through the use of violence – the only consistent argument for the *value* of violence is the use of violence.[^4]

In essence, then, debating requires an objective methodology, through meaningful language, in the pursuit of universal truth, which is objectively preferable to personal error.

This preference for universal truth is not a preference of *degree*, but of *kind*. A shortcut that reduces your driving time by half is twice as good as a longer route – but both are *infinitely preferable* to driving in the completely wrong direction.

In the same way, the truth is not just “better” than error – it is *infinitely preferable*, or required.

#### Premise 8: Individuals Are Responsible For Their Actions

If I argue that human beings are not responsible for their actions, I am caught in a paradox, which is the question of *whether or not I am responsible for my argument, and also whether or not you are responsible for your response*.

If my argument that human beings are *not* responsible for their actions is true, then I am not responsible for my argument, and you are not responsible for your reply. However, if I believe that you are not responsible for your reply, it would make precious little sense to advance an argument – it would be exactly the same as arguing with a television set.[^5]

Thus, fundamentally, if I tell you that you are not responsible for your actions, I am telling you that it is universally preferable for you to believe that preference is impossible, since if you have no control over your actions, you cannot choose a preferred state, i.e. truth over falsehood. Thus this argument, like the above arguments, self-destructs.

[^4]: It will be useful to keep this particular premise in mind, since it will be very important later on.

[^5]: The question of responsibility is, of course, closely related to the question of free will versus determinism, which will be the subject of another book.
