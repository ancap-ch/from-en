### Governments And Religion

A idéia de que nascer cria um contrato com uma agência de ficção, que em termos práticos o torna um quase escravo para indivíduos específicos, é comum tanto à religião quanto ao estado - e uma outra agência muito mais pessoal, que falo sobre no meu primeiro livro "Na verdade: A Tirania da Ilusão"

Sempre que um sacerdote diz: "Obedecer a Deus", o que ele realmente está dizendo é: "Obedecer-me *eu*." Como Deus não existe, qualquer mandamento que o sacerdote afirma que vem de Deus é realmente vindo do padre. “God” is just the fictional entity used to bully you conceptually in order to obtain your very practical subservience in the real world, to real individuals, in terms of voluntarily handing over money, time and resources.

It is far more efficient for exploiters to have their slaves consider slavery a virtue, since it cuts down enormously on the costs of controlling them. É muito mais eficiente para os exploradores que seus escravos considerem a escravidão uma virtude, uma vez que reduz enormemente os custos de controlá-los.

As mitologias religiosas e estaduais então são ficções que reduzem consideravelmente os custos de controle das populações; Eles são o lubrificante e o combustível para a horrível maquinaria da violência institucionalizada.

Em todo o mundo, os governantes são uma porcentagem muito pequena da população. Como pode ser possível que por um a dois por cento das pessoas controle todos os outros? There is a certain monopoly on armaments, to be sure, but that monopoly is relatively easy to counter, since most governments make a fortune selling weapons throughout the world.

A triste realidade é que as pessoas como um todo são escravizadas para entidades de ficção, como nações, deuses, culturas e governos.

Nosso orgulho pessoal se rebelaria instintivamente contra uma escravidão imediata e forçada para outro ser humano - no entanto, parecemos quase revelar a escravidão de * mitologia *.

O nosso desejo de ser bom - combinado com a emoção da virtude que obtemos obedecendo as mitologias morais - nos leva a entregar voluntariamente nossos recursos para aqueles que afirmam representar essas mitologias.

Uma razão central que sabemos que os governos e os deuses são desnecessários é que eles são tão eficazes. * Sabemos que a maioria das pessoas deseja desesperadamente ser boa porque são tão facilmente controladas por teorias morais *.

. A lógica da obediência à mitologia é manifestamente tola. Se um sacerdote me diz que tenho que obedecer "Deus", isso é exatamente o mesmo que ele me diz que devo obedecer a uma entidade chamada "Nog". Mesmo que eu aceite que essa entidade ficcional é digna de obediência eterna, isso ainda de forma alguma obrigaria-me a obedecer * o padre *. If I tell you to “obey your heart,” can I then reasonably say: “and *I alone* speak for your heart”?

Claro que não.

Quando retiramos mitologia e ficção de nossas "interações" com nossos governantes, o que emerge é uma realidade sombria, espalhafatosa e assassino.

Tomemos como exemplo um perigo muito real e presente: a tributação.

#### Tributação

. Fui informado que em virtude de escolher viver no Canadá, devo ao governo "mais de cinquenta por cento da minha renda.

Despojado da mitologia, para o que isso realmente se traduz?

Na realidade, vou esperar até o fim dos tempos para "o governo" vir e pegar seu dinheiro. Esperar que "o governo" caia é como querer namorar o conceito de "feminilidade". Posso também tentar pagar o meu jantar com a palavra "dinheiro"

Na realidade, quando me dizem que devo pagar meus impostos para "o governo", o que isso realmente significa é que devo escrever um cheque para transferir meu dinheiro para uma determinada conta bancária, que é acessada por indivíduos particulares. Esses indivíduos então têm o direito de tomar esse dinheiro e gastá-lo como acharem conveniente - esses indivíduos particulares, portanto, têm controle total sobre meu dinheiro.

Em nenhum momento, qualquer entidade como "o governo" levantar um dedo, fazer um movimento, abrir uma conta bancária ou gastar um centavo. Imaginando que um conceito chamado "o governo" tem a capacidade de levar ou gastar seu dinheiro é exatamente o mesmo que esperar que "Deus" venha buscá-lo e levá-lo para a igreja.

Assim, a interação real é que um homem me envia uma carta me dizendo que eu devo-lhe dinheiro. I have no contract with this guy, and he does not in fact own any of my property, although some other guys wrote a supposed “contract” which claims that he does.

If I do not pay this guy, he will send another guy over to my house to collect the money – plus “interest” and “charges.”

Normally, when a man with a gun comes to my house and demands my money, I have the right to use force to defend myself. In this case, however, because he is in a costume and claims to represent a fictional entity, I am not allowed to use force to defend myself.

Now, if I come to your house tonight dressed as a “high elf of Narnia” and demand the money that you owe to the “Queen of Sorrows,” assuming it is not Halloween, you are allowed to stare at me in amazement, and order me off your property.

If I do not pay the man who comes to take my money, he is allowed to pull out a gun, point it at my chest, and kidnap me – or shoot me if I resist. He can hold me in a tiny cell for year after year, where I will be subjected to the most violent brutality and continual rape, until he chooses to let me go.

Interestingly, if a man legitimately owes me money, I am not allowed to kidnap him and subject him to torture and rape for year after year. Thus taxation utterly violates the UPB framework, since it is the violent transfer of property using the initiation of force.

Stealing, as we have proven, is evil.

Einstein revolutionised physics by claiming – and proving – that the speed of light was constant.

We can revolutionise the world by accepting the claim – and the proof – that stealing is always evil.

### Government, Religion, And UPB

When we take the UPB framework and apply it to moral propositions regarding government and religion, some very interesting results occur.

The proposition that is most often used to justify government power is: “the government has the right to take your money.” This, however, is an utterly imprecise and false statement. The “government” does not have the right to take your money, since “the government” is merely a concept, an abstract description for a self-defined group of people. UPB requires a more consistent and objective statement. Since moral rules must be the same for everyone in all places and at all times, we must rephrase the rule in this way:

“*Human beings can morally take money from other human beings if they make up a conceptual agency that justifies their actions.*”

If we return to Bob and Doug in our little room of moral experimentation, we can very quickly see that this becomes an impossible proposition.

If Bob says to Doug: “I now represent the ideal concept ‘FUBAR,’ which fully justifies me taking your lighter from you. Since you now owe me your lighter, you must hand it over, or I will be compelled to take it from you by force.”

What will Doug’s reaction be? Remember, according to UPB, whatever is valid for Bob must also be valid for Doug. Inevitably, Doug will reply: “Oh yeah? Well *I* now represent the ideal concept ‘ANTI-FUBAR,’ which fully justifies me retaining possession of my lighter. Since you now have no right to take my lighter, if you try to take it, I will be compelled to defend myself by force.”

As you can see, if *Bob* has the right to make up imaginary obligations and impose them on Doug, then *Doug* has the right to make up imaginary obligations and impose them on Bob. Clearly, we immediately end up in a perfect stalemate. If it is morally good to impose made-up obligations on other people, but it is impossible to do it if *everyone* possesses that ability, then morality becomes impossible. The only way that Bob can impose his made-up obligation on Doug is if Doug refuses to impose his made up obligation on Bob – thus we have a situation where what is moral for one person can only be achieved by the other person acting in an anti-moral manner. Virtue can thus only be enabled by vice, which is impossible – and we have opposing moral rules for two human beings in the same circumstance, which UPB instantly rejects as invalid.

In other words, every imaginary abstract justification for the use of force can be countered by another imaginary abstract justification for the use of force. If I have an imaginary friend that can justify everything I do, then *you* also can have an imaginary friend that can justify everything you do. Thus neither of us can possess the ability to impose our imaginary obligations on others.

#### Religion And UPB

The same holds true for religion.

The statement: “You must obey me because God commands it,” must be restated more accurately as: “an entity that I have made up commands you to obey me.” The principle that UPB requires, then, is: “Human beings must impose unchosen positive obligations on others, and justify those obligations according to imaginary entities.”

Here we see the same issues as above. Bob tells Doug: “You must give me your lighter, because my imaginary friend tells you to.” Naturally, Doug replies: “You must not ask me for your lighter, because *my* imaginary friend forbids you to.” If Bob’s “commandments” are valid, then Doug’s “commandments” are equally valid, and so cancel each other out.

In the same way, if a man claims that his concept called “the government” justifies his theft of my property, then I can claim that my concept called “the anti-government” justifies my *retention* of my property, and we are both equally “valid” in our justifications.

If this tax collector then claims that his concept called “the government” only justifies his theft of *my* property, not my retention of it, then we are no further ahead. He can take my thousand dollars, but then I can invoke my concept to “steal” that money back, and his moral theory commands us to spend the rest of eternity handing back and forth the thousand dollars.

#### UPB And "The Majority"

UPB does not allow for the accumulation of individuals to override or reverse the properties of each individual. Ten lions do not make an elephant, a government, or a god. Ten thousand soldiers might make an “army,” but they cannot reverse gravity, or make murder moral.

Returning one last time to the room of Bob and Doug, let’s introduce “Jane.”

Now that there are three people in the room, we can look at the “majority rule” principle.

If Bob, Doug and Jane take a “vote” on whether or not it is moral to rape Jane, we would all recoil at such an unjust and immoral premise. Clearly, even if Jane were “outvoted,” we would not consider the resulting rape to be transformed into a morally good act.

Why not?

Well, UPB does not recognise the reality of aggregations, since the “majority” is a mere conceptual tag; it does not exist in reality, any more than “gods” or “governments” do. Thus to claim that the concept of “the majority” has any sort of moral standing is utterly invalid – it is like saying that “the Fatherland” can impregnate a woman, or that one can sit in the word “chair.”

To say that “the majority” has rights or attributes which directly contradict the rights or attributes of any individual also contradicts rational principles, since any conceptual grouping is only validated by the accurate identification of individual characteristics. If I say that “mammals” are warm-blooded living creatures, can I logically include three plastic flamingos in the category “mammal”?

Claro que não.

Thus if it is evil for human beings to rape, can I logically create a category called “the majority” and then claim that for *these* human beings, rape is now morally good?

Of *course* not.

### Majority Rule

Can I create a moral rule that says: “the majority should be able to do whatever it wants”?

Of course I can, but it will never be valid or true.

Only *individuals* act – the “majority” never does. If moral rules can change when a certain number of people get together, then UPB is continually violated.

If it is moral for Bob and Doug to rape Jane because they have “outvoted her,” what happens when Jane’s two friends show up and vote against Bob and Doug’s infernal desires?

Well, suddenly Bob and Doug are the ones outvoted, and rape becomes “evil” for them again.

Nothing substantial has changed in these “outvoting” scenarios, but we have a series of opposing moral rules for the same men – a violation of UPB, and thus invalid.

Rape cannot be good, then evil, then good again, just because a few hands are raised or lowered.

Thus if you think that “majority rule” sounds like a reasonable moral proposition, and a perfectly valid moral theory, then I am afraid you’re going to have to go back to the beginning of this book and start again!☺
