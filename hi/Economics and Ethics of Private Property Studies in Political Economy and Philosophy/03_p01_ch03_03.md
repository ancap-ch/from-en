दूसरा, वस्तविक सोने के बजाय पैसे के उपयोग का विकल्प ढंग से प्रोत्साहित करना चाहिए और इस तरह केई कानूनी निविदा के कानूनों को प्रवृत्ति द्वारा समर्थित किया गया। यह जालसाजी की प्रक्रिया है, जिससे बहुत कम मेहंगई होती है सोने को घटाने के बजाय केवल कागज टिकट मुद्रित किया जाना चाहिए.

हालांकि, जो समस्या पहले भी चर्चा में रही है अभी भी है। जितने लंबे समय के लिए मुफ्त बैंकिंग का ऑपरेशन जारी रहेगा, नकली नोटों को नय्ये मुद्दे के अनुरोध मोचन से वापस लेने से बचाया नहीं जा सकता और वह कर ही नही सख्ते कम से कम संकोची समायोजन के बिना उसके दायित्वों को पूरा। इस बाधा पर काबू पाने के लिए राज्य को चाहिए कि एकाधिकार बैंकिंग सिस्टम को लागो करे या फिर प्रतिस्पर्धा बैंक्स को बल करे कार्टेल के संरक्षण के तहत अपने स्वयं के राज्य-संचालित केंद्रीय बैंक में। एक बार जब यह एकाधिकार या काटलाइज्ड बैंकिंग प्रणाली के कमान में होगा, तो राज्य समन्वित और संयुक्त जालसाजी की प्रक्रिया पूरी बैंकिंग को प्रणाली में डाल सकता है जो बचा लेगा जोखिम के प्रभाव से।

अगले चरण में सोने को राष्ट्रीयकृत करना चाहिए,वह यह है कि,राज्य को चाहिए कि सभी बैंकस सोना जमा करे केंद्रीय बैंक में और चाहिए की वह अपना काम या बिज़नेस रुपयों से करे सोने के बजाय। इस प्रकार से सोना जो वास्तव में इस्तेमाल किया जाता था ऐक विनिमय माध्यम के तौर पर बाजार से गायब हो गया और उसके बजाय हरदिन का लेनदेन तेजी से बढ़ने लगा केंद्रीय पैसों के उपयोग के द्वारा।

अंत में, सोना पहले से ही दृष्टि और राज्य के एकमात्र अधिकार से बाहर हो गया है, राज्य को चाहिए कि वो कटौती करे अंतिम टाई को सोने से reneging पर अपने संविदात्मक दायित्वों और इसके नोट्स को अपूरणीय गोशित करे सोने के खंडरो पर प्रमाण जिसकी वजह से मानक पैसुं को शुरू में यह संभव हुआ कि कागज के नोटों को वास्तव में किसी भी प्राप्त क्रय शक्ति के लिए इस्तेमाल किया जा सकता है, एक शुद्ध फिएट मानक पैसूं को सीधा कर दिया है और आपरेशन में रखा गया है, लंबे समय में राज्य को सौंपने में असीमित जालसाजी शक्ति जिसके लिए होड़ किया गया था.

जालसाजी स्वायत्तता का लक्ष्य इस तरह रणनीति को दिखाता है जो मनोवैज्ञानिक के सामने दिखना चाहिए । Obviously, in approaching its ultimate goal the state creates victims and thus it is also in need of favorable public opinion. निरपेक्ष जालसाजी शक्ति की वृद्धि को पुनर्वितरण उपाय के साथ किया जाना चाहिए जिसकी वजह से उत्पन्न आवश्यक समर्थन मिलता है सभी आगामी बलों के प्रतिरोध से यह देखने के लिए चाहिए था ।

Regarding the state’s monopolization of law and order, traffic, communication and education, and the democratization of its organizational structure—while it is clear that they are all redistributive measures and as such imply favoring one person at the expense of another—it is difficult if not impossible to identify the gainers and the losers with definite social classes: there can be gainers (or losers) across different classes: within one social class there can be gainers and losers; and the pattern of redistribution can shift over time. In all of these cases the link between the state’s redistributive expenditures and their payoffs is only indirect: whether or not certain education expenditures, for instance, pay off in terms of increased state income will only become visible at a later date; and even then it will be difficult to attribute such an outcome to a definite cause. In the case of the monopolization of money and banking, on the other hand, who outside the apparatus of the state itself will be the benefactors of its redistributive policies and who the losers will be is clear at once; and sociologically the benefactors can easily be identified with a specific social class. In this case the connection between the state’s handing out redistributive favors and its own enrichment is direct and close-circuited; and the attribution of causes obvious: The state is compelled to make banks and the social class of bankers its accomplices by allowing them to participate in its counterfeiting operations and so enrich themselves along with the state’s own enrichment.

Bankers would be the first ones to become aware of the state’s attempts at counterfeiting. Without special incentives to the contrary they would have no reason to support such actions and every reason to uncover and stop them as quickly as possible. And the state would not run into just any opposition here: bankers, because of their exalted position in economic life and in particular because of their far-reaching interconnectedness as a professional group resulting from the nature of their business as facilitators of interspatial and intertemporal exchanges, would be the most formidable opposition one might encounter. The incentive necessary to turn such potential enemies into natural allies is the state’s offer to cut them in on its own fraudulent machinations. Familiar with the ideas of counterfeiting and its great potential for one’s own enrichment, but knowing, too, that there is no chance of engaging in it without running the immediate risk of bankruptcy under free, competitive banking and a gold standard, bankers are faced with an almost irresistible temptation. Going along with the state’s policy of monopolizing money and banking also means fulfilling one’s own dreams of getting rich fast. Not only the state comes into its own once a pure fiat money standard is established. Provided that they are accorded the privilege by the state to counterfeit in addition to its own counterfeited notes under a monetary regime of less than 100-percent-reserve banking, with the central bank functioning as a last resort counterfeiter banks can only too easily be persuaded to regard the establishment of such a monetary system as their ultimate goal and as a universal panacea.[^16]

Economically, this coalition between the state—as the dominant partner—and the banking system—as its affiliate—leads to permanent inflation (constrained only by the imperative of not overdoing it and causing a breakdown of the entire monetary system), to credit expansion and steadily recurring boom-bust cycles, and to a smooth uninterrupted income and wealth redistribution in the state’s and the banks’ favor.

Still more important, however, are the sociological implications of this alliance: With its formation a ruling class whose interests are tied in closely with those of the state is established within civil society. Through its cooperation the state can now extend its coercive power to practically every area of society.

Before the establishment of the state-banking alliance, the sociological separation between state and society, i.e., between an exploitative ruling class and a class of exploited producers, is almost complete and clearly visible. Here is a civil society that produces all economic wealth; and there is the state and its representatives who draw parasitically on what others have produced. People are members either of civil society or the state and see their own interests connected with either the former or the latter. To be sure, there are then redistributive activities going on which favor parts of society at the expense of others and which help divert interests from the pursuit of economic integration to that of supporting exploitation. Yet social corruption is unsystematic at this stage. It is not corruption of social classes which are connected society-wide, but rather corruption of various disparate and dispersed individuals or groups. And these interests are only connected to those of the state rather tenuously through certain specific redistributive state activities, rather than through a direct cash-connection.

With the formation of a state-banking alliance all this becomes different. A cash-connection between parts of civil society and the state exists—and nothing ties people more closely together than joint financial interests. Moreover, this connection is established between the state and what can be identified not only as a closely interconnected social class, but as one of the most widely influential and powerful ones. In fact, it is not just the banks who join interests with the state and its policy of exploitation. The banks’ major clients, the business establishment and the leaders of industry become deeply integrated in the state’s counterfeiting schemes, too. For it is they who, apart from state and banks, are the earliest receivers of most of the regularly created counterfeit money. In receiving it before it gradually ripples through the economic system, and thereby changes relative prices as well as increases the overall price level, and in receiving credit at fraudulently lowered interest rates, they too enrich themselves at the expense of all savers and all later recipients or nonrecipients of this money.[^17]

Moreover, this financial coalition between the industrial establishment, banks, and the state tends to be reinforced by each successive course of events. The credit expansion leads to increased investment and—since it is not covered by an increase in genuine savings—will inevitably result in a corrective contraction. In order to avoid losses or even bankruptcy the bank’s clients will approach the banking system with an increased demand for liquidity (i.e., money). Naturally, to avoid losses of their own the banks are eager to help their clients out—and the more so the more established they are as clients. Unable to do this on their own, they turn to the state and its central bank. And the state, then, being offered another chance at its own enrichment, accepts and provides the banking system, and by extension the business establishment, with the needed liquidity by means of a new round of counterfeiting. The alliance is renewed, and the state has reaffirmed its dominant role by having saved the established banking and the industrial elite from crumbling in the face of economic competition and allowing them instead to preserve the status quo or even further increase the wealth already concentrated in their hands. There is reason to be thankful and to reciprocate with invigorated public support for the state and its propaganda.

To be sure, this coalition between the state and the economic power elite by no means implies a complete identity of interests. The various established industrial enterprises may have different or even contrary interests; and the same is true for the banks. Similarly, the interests of banks and business clients may in many respects be different. Nor do the interests of the industrial elite or the banks coincide completely with those of the state. For after all, banks as well as industrial enterprises are also in the “normal” business of making money through production and productive exchanges—whatever other sources of income acquisition may be available to them. And in this function their interests may well clash with the state’s desire for taxes, for instance. Nonetheless, the establishment of a system of monopolized money and banking still creates one interest common to all of them: an interest in the preservation of the state apparatus and the institution of political (i.e., exploitative) means of income appropriation as such. Not only could the state and its central bank destroy any commercial bank and, indirectly, practically any industrial enterprise; this threat is more severe the more established a business is. The state could also help any and all of them get richer, and more so if they are already rich. Hence, the more there is to lose from opposition and to gain from compliance, the more intensive will be the attempts by the economic power elite to infiltrate the state apparatus and have the state leaders assume financial interests in the business world. Bankers and industrialists become politicians; and politicians take positions in banking and industry. A social system emerges and is increasingly characteristic of the modern world in which the state and a closely associated class of banking and business leaders exploit everyone else.[^18][^19]

[^18]: In the Marxist tradition this stage of social development is termed “monopoly capitalism,” “finance capitalism,” or “state monopoly capitalism.”

The descriptive part of Marxist analyses is generally valuable. In unearthing the close personal and financial links between state and business, they usually paint a much more realistic picture of the present economic order than do the mostly starry-eyed “bourgeois economists.” Analytically, however, they get almost everything wrong and turn the truth upside down.

The traditional, correct pre-Marxist view on exploitation was that of radical laissez-faire liberalism as espoused by, for instance, Charles Comte and Charles Dunoyer. According to them, antagonistic interests do not exist between capitalists as owners of factors of production and laborers, but between, on the one hand, the producers in society, i.e., homesteaders, producers and contractors, including businessmen as *well* as workers, and on the other hand, those who acquire wealth nonproductively and/or noncontractually, i.e., the state and stateprivileged groups, such as feudal landlords. This distinction was first confused by Saint-Simon, who had at some time been influenced by Comte and Dunoyer, and who classified market businessmen along with feudal lords and other stateprivileged groups as exploiters. Marx took up this confusion from Saint-Simon and compounded it by making only capitalists exploiters and all workers exploited, justifying this view through a Ricardian labor theory of value and his theory of surplus value. Essentially, this view on exploitation has remained typical for Marxism to this day despite Böhm-Bawerk’s smashing refutation of Marx’s exploitation theory and his explanation of the difference between factor prices and output prices through time preference (interest). To this day, whenever Marxist theorists talk about the exploitative character of monopoly capitalism, they see the root cause of this in the continued existence of the private ownership of means of production. Even if they admit a certain degree of independence of the state apparatus from the class of monopoly capitalists (as in the version of “state monopoly capitalism”), for them it is not the state that makes capitalist exploitation possible; rather it is the fact that the state is an agency of capitalism, an organization that transforms the narrow-minded interests of individual capitalists into the interest of an ideal universal capitalist (the *ideelle Gesamtkapitalist*), which explains the existence of exploitation.

In fact, as explained, the truth is precisely the opposite: It is the state that by its very nature is an exploitative organization, and capitalists can engage in exploitation only insofar as they stop being capitalists and instead join forces with the state. Rather than speaking of state monopoly capitalism, then, it would be more appropriate to call the present system “state financed monopoly socialism,” or “bourgeois socialism.”

[^19]: To recognize the far-reaching integration of state interests and those of the economic power elite, which is brought about by the monopolization of money and banking, is not to say that there cannot be conflicts arising within this coalition. As mentioned earlier, the state is also characterized, for instance, by the necessity of democratizing its constitution. And the democratic process could well bring egalitarian or populist sentiments to the surface which were opposed to the state’s favorable treatment of banks and big business. हालांकि, यह सही वित्तीय प्रकृति के राज्य-व्यापार कनेक्शन को बनाता है इस तरह की एक घटना की संभावना नहीं है । यह सिर्फ तत्काल खतरा नहीं है आर्थिक शक्ति अभिजात वर्ग के लिए; यह गंभीर वित्तीय घाटा भी कर सख्ता है राज्य की आय में, चाहे यह कोई खतरा ना हो राज्य की स्थिरता के लिए । Hence a powerful incentive exists for both sides to join forces in filtering any such sentiment out of the political process before it ever becomes widely heard and to ensure with all resources at their command that the range of political alternatives admitted to public discussion is so restricted as to systematically exclude any scrutinizing of their joint counterfeiting racket.
