## 前言

在许多童话故事，有一个可怕的惊人力量的野兽，龙或蛇，这迫害霸占周围的土地。当地村民颤抖在这个怪物；他们牺牲了他们的动物，付出金钱和鲜血，希望平息其杀人的冲动。

大多数人畏缩这野兽的阴影下，称自己的恐惧”的谨慎，但几–醉也许勇气或鲁莽–决定战斗。年复一年，十年后十年，一波又一波的希望捍卫者试图配合他们的实力、美德和狡猾对抗这个可怕的暴君。

尝试 -并失败。

野兽永远不死，所以村民们不能指望时间来消灭他们的暴君。野兽从不理性，也不想交易，所以没有谈判是可能的。

绝望的村民们唯一希望的是一个能打败野兽的人出现。

不可避免地，一个人向前走，把每个人都看成是完全不协调的。他是一个稳定的男孩，一个鞋匠的儿子，一个面包师的学徒–或有时候只是一个流浪汉。

这本书是我个人攻击这样一个野兽的故事。

这种“野兽”的信念是不可能定义一个客观的、理性的、世俗的和科学的道德体系。这种“野兽”是一种错觉，认为道德必须永远迷失在上帝和政府的不合理的沼泽中，仅仅出于实用主义的理由而强制执行，但永远缺乏逻辑的理由和明确的定义。这个“野兽”是幻想的美德，我们最大的喜悦，我们最深的幸福，必须抛开世俗的大人，和在尘土中被抓，游行和被政客和牧师–和父母。这个“野兽”是迷信，没有父母的长篇大论，欺负神或政府的枪，我们不能理性和良好的相信。

这种野兽把许多伟大的英雄: Socrates、Plato、Augustine、Hume、Kant、Rand。

人类的代价是巨大的。

因为我们仍然无法确定合理的普遍的道德体系，我们不得不把宗教恐怖的故事对我们的孩子，或者把枪支，监狱和军队没有灵魂控制器自称“国家小垄断。

由于我们所说的“伦理”仍然是主观的，只是文化的，我们不可避免地依赖于欺凌、恐惧和暴力来执行社会规则。由于伦理缺乏科学方法的理性依据，“道德”仍然深陷血腥神话的部族之争中，各个团伙为了控制人们对“美德”的忠诚而斗争。

我们不能没有道德生活，但我们不能客观地定义道德 -因此我们永远谴责浮夸虚伪空虚，愤世嫉俗的优势或虔诚的奴隶。

理智上，世界上没有更高的赌注。在宗教和国家的战争中，我们没有界定客观和理性的道德规范，造成数亿人的生命损失。

在许多方面，风险越来越大。

互联网信息流量的增加引发了新一代人的怀疑，所谓的“美德”不过是他们伪善的长辈的自私童话而已。那些当权者所说的虔诚的谎言—以及那些崇拜他们的人的共谋 — 现在比以前更清楚了。

“真理”被认为操纵；“德”作为对照；“忠诚”的奴隶，和所谓的“道德”被发现是一个可笑的木偶剧, 旨在欺骗软弱和恐惧的人们进行奴役。

这种认识催生了新一代的虚无主义者，就像在十九世纪德国一样。这些极端的相对主义者保留最尖刻的攻击的人谁声称任何形式的确定性。这种后现代的一代不再有他们的集体历史文化的偏见，但现在看来所有的真理仅仅是偏见的断言。像睁大眼睛的孩子一样，他们被视为愤世嫉俗的“智慧”，他们把所有的沟通看作是广告，所有的宣传都是宣传，都是虚伪的道德规劝偷窃。

由于我们对一个有凝聚力的、客观的、合理的道德命题评估框架没有达成一致，所以“道德”仍然陷入了神秘主义，而且是不可避免的必然结果。同样，到启蒙运动之前，宗教派别为了控制贵族阶层而无休无止地争夺战争，所以现在做竞争的道德神话战争对国家的控制，和所有的机械强迫。

因此，相对于现代科学而言，道德仍然存在，正如中世纪“天文学”对现代天文学所做的那样 -通过讲故事，威胁，强迫和剥削而实施的想象神话的领域，- 它积极阻止任何朝向真理的真正进展。

这个“野兽”的相对论伦理上织机，捕食我们，调整税收、监禁、审查和战争。它在州立学校和星期天的长椅上奴役年轻人；它诱捕穷人福利软营；它奴役甚至出生在国家债务的无底洞威尔斯。

正如我在以前的书中写道，“在真相：幻觉的暴政，“在未经证实的伦理理论的中心最基本的谎言就是这样的理论总是呈现给孩子以客观、确凿无疑的事实，当事实上他们仅仅是文化偏见。科学家不需要政府或梵蒂冈的原因是科学家有一个客观的方法来解决争端： 科学方法。语言不需要一个中央权威来指导其演变，其原因在于它依赖于积累的个人偏好的“自由市场”，即风格和效用。

现代道德–道德在历史上–一直在欺负孩子依赖的原因，然后对威胁大人，是操纵谎言伪装成一个良性的真理。

事实上，我们需要道德，谎言是上帝或政府可以合理地定义或公正地执行它。

我在这本书中的目标是定义一种方法来验证道德理论是客观的、一致的、清楚的、合理的、经验性的和真实的。

I am fully aware that, at this moment, you will very likely be feeling a rising wave of scepticism. I fully understand that the odds that some guy out there on the Internet – the home world of crazies – has somehow solved the philosophical problem of the ages are not particularly high – in fact, they would be so close to zero as to be virtually indistinguishable from it.

Still, not *quite* zero.

### Ground Rules

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. In taking on this mammoth task – particularly in such a short book – I have set myself some basic ground rules, which are worth going over here.[^1]

1. I fully accept the Humean distinction between “is” and “ought.” Valid moral rules cannot be directly derived from the existence of anything in reality. The fact that human beings in general *prefer* to live, and must successfully interact with reality in order to do so, cannot be the basis for any valid theory of ethics. Some people clearly do not prefer to live, and steadfastly reject reality, so this definition of ethics remains subjective and conditional.
2. Ethics cannot be objectively defined as “that which is good for man’s survival.” Certain individuals can survive very well by preying on others, so this definition of ethics does not overcome the problem of subjectivism. In biological terms, this would be analogous to describing evolutionary tendencies as “that which is good for *life’s* survival” – this would make no sense. Human society is an ecosystem of competing interests, just as the rainforest is, and what is “good” for one man so often comes at the expense of another.
3. I do not believe in any “higher realm” of Ideal Forms. Morality cannot be conceived of as existing in any “other universe,” either material or immaterial. If morality exists in some “other realm,” it cannot then be subjected to a rigorous rational or empirical analysis – and, as Plato himself noted in “The Republic,” society would thus require an elite cadre of Philosopher-Kings to communicate – or, more accurately, *enforce* – the incomprehensible edicts of this “other realm” upon everyone else. This also does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since that which is inaccessible to reason and evidence is by definition subjective.
4. I do not believe that morality can be defined or determined with reference to “arguments from effect,” or the predicted consequences of ethical propositions. Utilitarianism, or “the greatest good for the greatest number,” does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since the odds of any central planner knowing what is objectively good for everyone else are about the same as any central economic planner knowing how to efficiently allocate resources in the absence of price – effectively zero. Also, that which is considered “the greatest good for the greatest number” changes according to culture, knowledge, time and circumstances, which also fails to overcome the problem of subjectivism. We do not judge the value of scientific experiments according to some Platonic higher realm, or some utilitarian optimisation – they are judged in accordance with the scientific method. I will take the same approach in this book.
5. I also refuse to define ethics as a “positive law doctrine.” Although it is generally accepted that legal systems are founded upon systems of ethics, no one could argue that every law within every legal system is a perfect reflection of an ideal morality. Laws cannot directly mirror *any* objective theory of ethics, since laws are in a continual state of flux, constantly being overturned, abandoned and invented – and legal systems the world over are often in direct opposition to one another, even at the theoretical level. Sharia law is often directly opposed to Anglo-Saxon common-law, and the modern democratic “mob rule” process often seems more akin to a Mafia shoot-out than a sober implementation of ethical ideals.
6. I am fully open to the proposition that there is no such thing as ethics at all, and that all systems of “morality” are mere instruments of control, as Nietzsche argued so insistently. In this book, I start from the assumption that there is no such thing as ethics, and build a framework from there.
7. I do have great respect for the ethical *instincts* of mankind. The near-universal social prohibitions on murder, rape, assault and theft are facts that any rational ethicist discards at his peril. Aristotle argued that any ethical theory that can be used to prove that rape is moral must have something wrong with it, to say the least. Thus, after I have developed a framework for validating ethical theories, I run these generally accepted moral premises through that framework, to see whether or not they hold true.
8. I respect your intelligence enough to refrain from defining words like “reality,” “reason,” “integrity” and so on. We have enough work to do without having to reinvent the wheel.
9. Finally, I believe that any theory – especially one as fundamental as a theory of ethics – does little good if it merely confirms what everybody already knows instinctively. I have not spent years of my life working on a theory of ethics in order to run around proving that “murder is wrong.” In my view, the best theories are those which verify the truths that we all intuitively understand – and then use those principles to reveal new truths that may be completely counter-intuitive.

Having spent the last few years of my life preparing, training, and then combating this beast, I hope that I have acquitted myself with some measure of honour. I believe that I have emerged victorious – though not entirely unscathed – and I look forward to seeing who shares this view.[^2]

I studied the history of philosophy in graduate school, and hold a Masters degree, but I do not have a PhD in philosophy. I am far from a publicly recognised intellectual. While I may not be the *most* unlikely champion, I am also far from the most likely. Whether I have succeeded or not is not up to you, and it is not up to me.

If the reasoning holds, the greatest beast is down.

### A Modest Suggestion

It is the height of audacity to suggest to readers how to read a book, but given the challenges of the task before us, I would like to make one small suggestion before we embark.

If we lived in the fifteenth century, and I were trying to convince you that the world were round, I would put forward reams of mathematical and physical proofs. If you held a contrary opinion, you would naturally react with scepticism, and be inclined to quibble with every line of proof. However, if you and I could in fact sail around the world, and arrive back where we started without retracing our steps, you would be far more willing to accept the conceptual proofs for what you had already *experienced* to be true. You might find fault with a particular logical step or metaphor, but you would already agree with the conclusion, and thus would be more prone to help correct the details rather than reject the theory as a whole.

If my task were to respond to every possible objection to every linguistic, logical and empirical step, this book would remain forever unfinished – and unread. Perfectionism is, in essence, procrastination, and I consider the task of this book to be too important – and the dangers of false morality too grave and imminent – to spend so long trying to achieve heaven that we all end up in hell.

Thus I humbly suggest that you wait to see how effective the ethical framework I propose is at proving the most commonly accepted moral maxims of mankind before passing final judgement on the theory.

I truly believe that the definition of a rational ethical framework is the most essential task that faces mankind. I truly appreciate your interest in this crucial matter – and would like as always to thank the wonderfully kind donators who have made this work possible.

I ride into battle well armed by others.
