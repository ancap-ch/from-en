## Foreword

In numerous tall tales, there lives a shocking brute of dynamite control, a mythical beast or a basilisk, which tyrannizes the encompassing grounds. The nearby villagers tremble before this beast; they forfeit their creatures, pay cash and blood in the expectations of pacifying its dangerous motivations.

A great many people grovel under the shadow of this monster, calling their dread "judiciousness," however a couple – smashed maybe on valor or recklessness – choose to battle. After a seemingly endless amount of time, decade after decade, wave after flood of cheerful champions endeavor to coordinate their quality, temperance and sly against this appalling despot.

Try – and fail.

The mammoth is constantly godlike, so the villagers can't seek after time to free them of their dictator. The mammoth is never discerning, and wants to exchange, thus no transactions are conceivable.

The edgy villagers' just seek is after a man to show up who can vanquish the monster.

Unavoidably, a man ventures forward who strikes everybody as absolutely garbled. He is a steady kid, a shoemaker's child, a pastry specialist's understudy – or some of the time, only a drifter.

This book is the account of my own ambush on simply such a mammoth.

This "mammoth" is the conviction that it is difficult to characterize a goal, sane, mainstream and logical moral framework. This "monster" is the dream that profound quality should perpetually be lost in the silly bogs of divine beings and governments, upheld for simply down to earth reasons, yet everlastingly missing intelligent avocation and clear definition. This "monster" is the dream that temperance, our most prominent delight, our most profound bliss, must be thrown away by common adults, and left in the tidy to be pawed at, paraded and abused by government officials and ministers – and guardians. This "mammoth" is the superstition that, without the tirades of guardians, the tormenting of divine beings or the weapons of governments, we can't be both balanced and great.

This brute has cut down numerous incredible legends, from Socrates to Plato to Augustine to Hume to Kant to Rand.

The cost to mankind has been enormous.

Since we have stayed unfit to characterize a normal arrangement of all inclusive profound quality, we have been compelled to incur religious frightfulness stories on our youngsters, or give weapons, detainment facilities and armed forces to a little imposing business model of callous controllers who call themselves "the state."

Since what we call "morals" stays subjective and simply *cultural*, we unavoidably wind up depending on tormenting, dread and viciousness to authorize social tenets. Since morals do not have the levelheaded premise of the logical strategy, "ethical quality" stays buried in an inborn war of bleeding folklores, each pack battling like there's no tomorrow for control over individuals' constancy to "ethicalness."

We can't live without profound quality, yet we can't characterize ethical quality dispassionately – along these lines we remain interminably sentenced to purge lives of self important affectation, skeptical predominance or devout subjection.

Mentally, there are no higher stakes on the planet. Our inability to characterize target and discerning good guidelines has taken a toll a huge number of human lives, in the wars of religions and states.

In many ways, the stakes are getting even higher.

The expanded data stream of the Internet has raised the doubts of another age that what is called "ideals" is nothing more – or less – than the self-serving fables of their fraudulent older folks. The devout falsehoods told by those in specialist – and the complicity of the individuals who adore them – are clearer now than any time in recent memory.

"Truth" has been uncovered as control; "ideals" as control; "dedication" as subjection, and what is called "ethical quality" has been uncovered as a strange manikin demonstrate intended to trap frail and frightful individuals into subjugating themselves.

This acknowledgment has brought forth another age of skeptics, similarly as it did in nineteenth century Germany. These outrageous relativists hold their most vitriolic assaults for any individual who asserts any type of assurance. This post-present day age has outgrown the social bigotries of their aggregate histories, yet now see *all* truth as unimportant biased attestation. Like wide-looked at youngsters who have been scarred into pessimistic "intelligence," they see all correspondence as publicizing, all cases as purposeful publicity, and every single good urging as tricky burglary.

Since we have no concession to a firm, target and levelheaded system for assessing moral suggestions, "ethical quality" stays buried in magic, and its inescapable end product of brutality. Similarly as, preceding the Enlightenment, religious organizations warred interminably for control over the edges of the nobility, so now do contending moral legends war for control over the state, and all its apparatus of pressure.

Accordingly ethical quality stays, in respect to present day science, similarly as medieval "stargazing" did to current space science – a domain of fanciful folklore, upheld through narrating, dangers, impulse and abuse – which effectively bars any genuine advance towards reality.

This "mammoth" of relativistic morals lingers above us, going after us, defending tax collection, detainment, restriction and wars. It subjugates the youthful in state schools and Sunday seats; it captures the poor in the delicate gulags of welfare; it oppresses even the unborn in the endless wells of national obligations.

As I wrote in my past book, "On Truth: The Tyranny of Illusion," the most crucial lie at the focal point of dubious moral speculations is that such hypotheses are constantly introduced to kids as goal and undeniable certainties, when in truth they are simple social bigotries. The reason that researchers needn't bother with a legislature or a Vatican is that researchers have a target procedure for settling question: the logical technique. The reason that dialect does not require a focal specialist to manage its development is that it depends on the "free market" of aggregated individual inclinations for style and utility.

The reason that cutting edge ethical quality – and profound quality all through history – has dependably needed to depend first on the harassing of kids, and after that on the debilitating of grown-ups, is that it is a manipulative lie taking on the appearance of an idealistic truth.

Truly we require ethical quality; the lie is that divine beings or governments can objectively characterize or fairly implement it.

My objective in this book is to characterize an approach for approving good hypotheses that is objective, steady, clear, normal, exact – and *true*.

I am completely mindful that, right now, you will probably be feeling a rising flood of distrust. I completely comprehend that the chances that some person out there on the Internet – the home universe of crazies – has some way or another tackled the philosophical issue of the ages are not especially high – actually, they would be so near zero as to be for all intents and purposes indistinct from it.

Still, not *quite* zero.

### Ground Rules

Extraordinary claims require extraordinary proof. In taking on this mammoth task – particularly in such a short book – I have set myself some basic ground rules, which are worth going over here.[^1]

1. I fully accept the Humean distinction between “is” and “ought.” Valid moral rules cannot be directly derived from the existence of anything in reality. The fact that human beings in general *prefer* to live, and must successfully interact with reality in order to do so, cannot be the basis for any valid theory of ethics. Some people clearly do not prefer to live, and steadfastly reject reality, so this definition of ethics remains subjective and conditional.
2. Ethics cannot be objectively defined as “that which is good for man’s survival.” Certain individuals can survive very well by preying on others, so this definition of ethics does not overcome the problem of subjectivism. In biological terms, this would be analogous to describing evolutionary tendencies as “that which is good for *life’s* survival” – this would make no sense. Human society is an ecosystem of competing interests, just as the rainforest is, and what is “good” for one man so often comes at the expense of another.
3. I do not believe in any “higher realm” of Ideal Forms. Morality cannot be conceived of as existing in any “other universe,” either material or immaterial. If morality exists in some “other realm,” it cannot then be subjected to a rigorous rational or empirical analysis – and, as Plato himself noted in “The Republic,” society would thus require an elite cadre of Philosopher-Kings to communicate – or, more accurately, *enforce* – the incomprehensible edicts of this “other realm” upon everyone else. This also does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since that which is inaccessible to reason and evidence is by definition subjective.
4. I do not believe that morality can be defined or determined with reference to “arguments from effect,” or the predicted consequences of ethical propositions. Utilitarianism, or “the greatest good for the greatest number,” does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since the odds of any central planner knowing what is objectively good for everyone else are about the same as any central economic planner knowing how to efficiently allocate resources in the absence of price – effectively zero. Also, that which is considered “the greatest good for the greatest number” changes according to culture, knowledge, time and circumstances, which also fails to overcome the problem of subjectivism. We do not judge the value of scientific experiments according to some Platonic higher realm, or some utilitarian optimisation – they are judged in accordance with the scientific method. I will take the same approach in this book.
5. I also refuse to define ethics as a “positive law doctrine.” Although it is generally accepted that legal systems are founded upon systems of ethics, no one could argue that every law within every legal system is a perfect reflection of an ideal morality. Laws cannot directly mirror *any* objective theory of ethics, since laws are in a continual state of flux, constantly being overturned, abandoned and invented – and legal systems the world over are often in direct opposition to one another, even at the theoretical level. Sharia law is often directly opposed to Anglo-Saxon common-law, and the modern democratic “mob rule” process often seems more akin to a Mafia shoot-out than a sober implementation of ethical ideals.
6. I am fully open to the proposition that there is no such thing as ethics at all, and that all systems of “morality” are mere instruments of control, as Nietzsche argued so insistently. In this book, I start from the assumption that there is no such thing as ethics, and build a framework from there.
7. I do have great respect for the ethical *instincts* of mankind. The near-universal social prohibitions on murder, rape, assault and theft are facts that any rational ethicist discards at his peril. Aristotle argued that any ethical theory that can be used to prove that rape is moral must have something wrong with it, to say the least. Thus, after I have developed a framework for validating ethical theories, I run these generally accepted moral premises through that framework, to see whether or not they hold true.
8. I respect your intelligence enough to refrain from defining words like “reality,” “reason,” “integrity” and so on. We have enough work to do without having to reinvent the wheel.
9. Finally, I believe that any theory – especially one as fundamental as a theory of ethics – does little good if it merely confirms what everybody already knows instinctively. I have not spent years of my life working on a theory of ethics in order to run around proving that “murder is wrong.” In my view, the best theories are those which verify the truths that we all intuitively understand – and then use those principles to reveal new truths that may be completely counter-intuitive.

Having spent the last few years of my life preparing, training, and then combating this beast, I hope that I have acquitted myself with some measure of honour. I believe that I have emerged victorious – though not entirely unscathed – and I look forward to seeing who shares this view.[^2]

I studied the history of philosophy in graduate school, and hold a Masters degree, but I do not have a PhD in philosophy. I am far from a publicly recognised intellectual. While I may not be the *most* unlikely champion, I am also far from the most likely. Whether I have succeeded or not is not up to you, and it is not up to me.

If the reasoning holds, the greatest beast is down.

### A Modest Suggestion

It is the height of audacity to suggest to readers how to read a book, but given the challenges of the task before us, I would like to make one small suggestion before we embark.

If we lived in the fifteenth century, and I were trying to convince you that the world were round, I would put forward reams of mathematical and physical proofs. If you held a contrary opinion, you would naturally react with scepticism, and be inclined to quibble with every line of proof. However, if you and I could in fact sail around the world, and arrive back where we started without retracing our steps, you would be far more willing to accept the conceptual proofs for what you had already *experienced* to be true. You might find fault with a particular logical step or metaphor, but you would already agree with the conclusion, and thus would be more prone to help correct the details rather than reject the theory as a whole.

If my task were to respond to every possible objection to every linguistic, logical and empirical step, this book would remain forever unfinished – and unread. Perfectionism is, in essence, procrastination, and I consider the task of this book to be too important – and the dangers of false morality too grave and imminent – to spend so long trying to achieve heaven that we all end up in hell.

Thus I humbly suggest that you wait to see how effective the ethical framework I propose is at proving the most commonly accepted moral maxims of mankind before passing final judgement on the theory.

I truly believe that the definition of a rational ethical framework is the most essential task that faces mankind. I truly appreciate your interest in this crucial matter – and would like as always to thank the wonderfully kind donators who have made this work possible.

I ride into battle well armed by others.
