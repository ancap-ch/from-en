Tercero, cualquiera que haya visto estaciones policiales y cortes llevadas por el estado, sin mencionar prisiones, sabe que tan cierto es que los factores de producción usados para proveernos con esa seguridad están sobreusados, mal mantenidos, y sucios. Ya que nadie usando estos factores de producción en realidad es dueño de ellos (nadie puede venderlos y apropiarse de manera privada los recibos de venta) y perdidas (y ganacias) en el valor encarnado en el capital usado son así socializados, todos tnderán a aumentar su ingreso privado resultado del uso de factores a las expensas de perdidas en valor capital. Por lo tanto, el costo marginal tenderá a exceder el valor marginal de producto, y una sobreutilización de capital se dará como resultado. Y si, en un caso excepcional, esto no sucede y una sobreutilización no debería ser aparente, entonces esto solo fue posible a costes que son comparativamente mucho mayores que aquellos de cualquier negocio privado similar.

Sin lugar a duda, todos estos problemas inherentes en un sistema de producción de seguridad monoplística sería resuelto relativamente rápido una vez una demanda dada por servicios de seguridad fue encontrada por mercado competitivo con su estructura incentiva y totalmente distinta para productores. Esto no quiere decir que una solución "perfecta" para el problema de seguridad pueda ser encontrada. Todavía existirían los robos y los asesinatos; y no todos los objetos podrían ser devueltos ni todos los asesinos atrapados. Pero en términos de evaluaciones de consumidor, la situación mejoraría hasta ñp que la naturaleza humana le permitiría mejorarlo. Primero, mientras exista un sistema competitivo (i.e., siempre que los productores de servicios de seguridad dependan de compras voluntarias, muchas de las cuales porbablemente tomen la forma de contratos de servicio y de seguridad accedan en adelanto a cualquier "ocurrencia" de inseguridad o agresión), ningún productor puede aumentar su ingreso sin mejorar sus servicios o su calidad de producto al ser percibidos por los consumidores. Más allá, todos los productores de seguridad juntos no pueden reforzar la importancia de su empresa particular a menos que, por cualquier razón, los consumidores de verdad empiecen a evaluar la seguridad como más importante que otros bienes, así asegurando que la producción de seguridad nunca tome lugar a expensas de la no-productividad o reducida de, digamos, queso, como un bien privado competitivo. En adición, los productores de servicios de seguridad tendrían que diversificar sus ofrecimientos a un término considerable debido a una demanda altamente diversificada de productos de seguridad entre millones y millones de consumidores existentes). Directamente dependiente en soporte del consumidor voluntario, ellos inmediatamente serían heridos financieramente si ellos no responden a propiadamente a los deseos o cambios en los deseos del consumidor. Así cada consumidor tendría una influencia directa, aunque pequeño, en la salida de bienes apareciendo o desapareciendo del mercado de la seguridad. En vez de ofrecer un "paquete de seguridad" uniforme para todos, una característica de la política de la producción del estado, una multitud de servicios de empaquetamiento aparecería en el mercado. Ellos serían adaptados a las diferentes necesidades seguridad de distintas personas, tomando en cuenta las ocupaciones distintas, distinto comportamiento de toma de riesgos, diferentes necesidades para protección y seguridad, y diferentes locaciones geográficas y restricciones de tiempo.

Pero eso está lejos de todo. Además de diversificación, el contenido y la calidad de los improductos mejorarían también. No solo el tratamiento de los consumidores por los empleados de las empresas de seguridad mejorarían inmediatamente, la actitud "no me podría importar menos", el ser arbitrario e incluso la brutalidad, la negligencia y la tardía del policía presente y los sistemas judiciales terminarían desapareciendo. Ya que los policías y los jueces serían dependientes en el soporte del consumidor voluntario, cualquier ejemplo de altrato de consumidores, de descortesía o ineptitud podrían costarles su trabajo. Más allá, la peculiaridad que el asentamiento de disputas entre cliente y su compañero de negocio es invariablemente confiado al juicio de más tarde, casi ciertamente desparecería de los libros, y el ser arbitrario en conflictos por parte de grupos independientes sería lo ofrecido normalmente por los productores de seguridad. Más impotante, para atraer y retener clientes, los productores de tales servicios deberán ofrecer contratos que permitieran al consumidor saber lo que esá comprando y habilitarlo para decir una válida, intersubjetiva queja si el rendimiento del productor de seguridad no le hizo justicia al contrato. Más especificamente, en la medidaen la que no sean contratos de servicio individualizados en donde el pago es realizado por un cliente para cubrir sus propios riesgos exclusivamente, sino contratos de seguro que requieran agrupar sus propios riegos con los de otras personas, contrario a la práctica presente estdística, estos contratos más ciertamente no seguirían conteniendo ningún esquema deliberadamente redistributivo favoreciendo un grupo de personas a las expensas de otro. De otra manera, si alguien tiene la sensación de que el contrato que se le ha ofrecido requiere que pague por las necesidades particlares de otro grupo y de sus factores de riesgo de posibles inseguridades, eso es, que él no percibiera como apliclable a su propio caso, él simplemente rechazaría firmarlo o cancelaría sus pagos.

Aunque todo esto sea dicho, la pregunta inevitablemente surgirá. "¿Un sistema competitivo de producción seguridad no, necesariamente, resultaría en un conflicto social permanente, en caos y en anarquía?" Muchas respuestas pueden ser dadas a esta pregunta. Primero, debe ser notado que esta impresión no concuerda de ninguna manera con la evidencia histórica y empírica. Sistemas de cortes competitivas han existido en muchos lugares (e.g., en la antigua Irlanda) antes de la llegada de la nación de Estado moderna, y, en cuanto sabemos, han trabajado bien. Juzgado por el entonces radio de crimen (crimen per capita), el policía privado en el así llamado Viejo Oeste (el cual incidentalmente no fue tan salvaje como muchas películas lo pintan) fueron relativamente más exitosos que los policías soportados por el estado de hoy. Y volviendo a experiencias y ejempplos contemporáneos, millones y millones de contratos internacionales existen incluso ahora, contratos de intercambio y viaje, y ciertamente parece ser una exageración decir, por ejemplo, que hay más fraude, más crimen, más brechas de contratos que en relaciones domética. 

However, this historical evidence is very much subject to dispute, in particular regarding whether any general information can be derived from it. Yet there are systematic reasons, too, why the fear expressed by the question is not well-founded. Paradoxical as it may seem, establishing a competitive system of security producers implies erecting an institutionalized incentive structure to produce an order of law and law-enforcement that embodies the highest possible degree of consensus regarding the question of conflict resolution. Such a structure will tend to generate less rather than more social unrest and conflict than would occur under monopolistic auspices.[^29] In order to understand this paradox, it is necessary to take a closer look at the only typical situation that concerns the skeptic and that allows him to believe in the superior virtue of a monopolistically organized order of security production: when a conflict arises between A and B, both are insured by different companies and the companies cannot come to an immediate agreement regarding the validity of the conflicting claims brought forward by their respective clients. (No problem would exist if such an agreement were reached or if both clients were insured by one and the same company—at least the problem then would not be different in any way from that emerging under a statist monopoly.) Would not such a situation always result in a shoot-out? This is highly unlikely. First, any violent battle between companies would be costly and risky, in particular if these companies had reached a respectable size (which would be important for them to have in order to appear as effective guarantors of security to their prospective clients in the first place). More importantly, under a competitive system with each company dependent on the continuation of voluntary consumer payments, any battle would have to be deliberately supported by each and every client of both companies. If there were only one person who withdrew his payments because he was not convinced a battle was necessary in the particular conflict at hand, there would be immediate economic pressure on the company to look for a peaceful solution to the conflict.[^30] Hence any competitive producer of security would be extremely cautious about engaging in violent measures in order to resolve conflicts. Rather, to the extent that it is peaceful conflict resolution that consumers want, each and every security producer would go to great lengths to provide it to its clients and to establish in advance, for everyone to know, to what arbitration process it would be willing to submit itself and its clients in case of a disagreement over the evaluation of conflicting claims. And as such a scheme could appear to the clients of different firms to be working only if there were agreement among them regarding such arbitrational measures, a system of law governing relations between companies that would be universally acceptable to the clients of all of the competing security producers would naturally evolve. Moreover, the economic pressure to generate rules representing a consensus on how conflicts should be handled is even more farreaching. Under a competitive system, the independent arbitrators who would be entrusted with the task of finding peaceful solutions to conflicts would be dependent on the continued support of the two disputing companies insofar as the companies could and would select different judges if either one of them were sufficiently dissatisfied with the outcome of the arbitration work. Thus, these judges would be under pressure to find solutions to the problems handed over to them that, this time not with respect to the procedural aspects of law but its content, would be acceptable to all of the clients of the firms involved.[^31] Otherwise one or all of the companies might lose customers, thus inducing those firms to turn to different arbitrators the next time they are in need of one.[^32]

But wouldn’t it be possible under a competitive system for a security producing firm to become an outlaw company—a firm, that is, which, supported by its own clients, started aggressing against others? There is certainly no way to deny that this might be possible, though again it must be emphasized that here one is in the realm of empirical social science and no one could know such a thing with certainty. And yet the tacit implication that the possibility that a security firm could become an outlaw company somehow indicates a severe deficiency in the philosophy and economics of a pure capitalist social order is fallacious.[^33]

First, it should be recalled that any social system, a statist-socialist order no less than a pure market economy, is dependent for its continued existence on public opinion and that a given state of public opinion at all times delimits what can or cannot occur as well as what is more or less likely to occur. The current state of public opinion in West Germany, for instance, makes it highly unlikely or even impossible that a statist-socialist system of the current Soviet type could be imposed on the West German public. The lack of public support for such a system would doom it to failure and make it collapse. It is even more unlikely that any attempt to impose a Soviet-type order could ever hope to succeed among Americans, given American public opinion. Hence, in order for us to see the problem of outlaw companies correctly, the above question should be phrased as follows: How likely is it that any such event would occur in a given society with its specific state of public opinion? Formulated in this way, it is clear that the answer would have to be different for different societies. For some, characterized by socialist ideas deeply entrenched in the public, there would be a greater likelihood of the reemergence of aggressor companies, and for other societies there would be a much smaller chance of this happening. But then, would the prospect of a competitive system of security production in any given case be better or worse than that of the continuation of a statist system? Let us look, for instance, at the present-day United States. Assume that by a legislative act the state had abolished its right to provide security with tax funds and a competitive system of security production was introduced. Given the state of public opinion, how likely then would it be that outlaw producers would spring up, and what if they did? Evidently, the answer would depend on the reactions of the public to this changed situation. Thus, the first reply to those challenging the idea of a private market for security would have to be: What about you? What would your reaction be? Does your fear of outlaw companies mean that you would then go out and engage in trade with a security producer that aggressed against other people and their property, and would you continue supporting it if it did? Certainly the critic would be much muted by this counterattack. But more important than this is the systematic challenge implied in this personal counterattack. Evidently, the described change in the situation would imply a change in the cost-benefit structure that everyone would face once he had to make his decisions. Before the introduction of a competitive system of security production, it had been legal to participate in and support (state) aggression. Now such an activity would be illegal. Hence, given one’s conscience, which makes each decision appear more or less costly (i.e., more or less in harmony with one’s own principles of correct behavior), support for a firm engaging in the exploitation of people unwilling to deliberately support its actions would be more costly than before. Given this fact, it must be assumed that the number of people (including even those who otherwise would have readily lent their support to the state) who would now spend their money to support a firm committed to honest business would rise wherever this social experiment was tried. In contrast, the number of people still committed to a policy of exploitation—of gaining at the expense of others—would fall. How drastic this effect would be would of course depend on the state of public opinion. In the example at hand—the United States, where the natural theory of property is extremely widespread and accepted as a private ethic, the libertarian philosophy being essentially the ideology on which the country was founded and that led it to the height it reached[^34]—the effect would naturally be particularly pronounced. Accordingly, security producing firms committed to the philosophy of protecting and enforcing libertarian law would attract the greatest bulk of public support and financial assistance. And while it may be true that some people, and among them especially those who have profited from the old order, might continue their support of a policy of aggression, it is very unlikely that they would be sufficient in number and financial strength to succeed in doing so. Rather, the likely outcome would be that the honest companies would develop the strength needed—alone or in a combined effort and supported in this effort by their own voluntary customers—to check any such emergence of outlaw producers and destroy them wherever and whenever they came into existence.[^35]

::::> If … the consumer is not free to buy security wherever he pleases, you forthwith see open up a large profession dedicated to arbitrariness and bad management. Justice becomes slow and costly, the police vexatious, individual liberty is no longer respected, the price of security is abusively inflated and inequitably apportioned, according to the power and influence of this or that class of consumers.

[^30]: Contrast this with the state’s policy of engaging in battles without having everyone’s deliberate support because it has the right to tax people; and ask yourself if the risk of war would be lower or higher if one had the right to stop paying taxes as soon as one had the feeling that the states’ handling of foreign affairs was not to one’s liking.

[^32]: Again, contrast this with state-employed judges who, because they are paid from taxes and so are relatively independent of consumer satisfaction, can pass judgments that are clearly not acceptable as fair by everyone; and ask yourself if the risk of not finding the truth in a given case would be lower or higher if one had the possibility of exerting economic pressure whenever one had the feeling that a judge who one day might have to adjudicate in one’s own case had not been sufficiently careful in assembling and judging the facts of a case, or simply was an outright crook.

[^35]: Naturally, insurance companies would assume a particularly important role in checking the emergence of outlaw companies. Note Morris and Linda Tannehill (*The Market of Liberty*, pp. 110–11):

::::> Insurance companies, a very important sector of any totally free economy, would have a special incentive to dissociate themselves from any aggressor and, in addition, to bring all their considerable business influence to bear against him. *Aggressive violence causes value loss*, and the insurance industry would suffer the major cost in most such value losses. An unrestrained aggressor is a walking liability, and no insurance company, however remotely removed from his original aggression, would wish to sustain the risk that he might aggress against one of its own clients next. Besides, aggressors and those who associate with them are more likely to be involved in situations of violence and are, thus, bad insurance risks. An insurance company would probably refuse coverage to such people out of a foresighted desire to minimize any future losses which their aggression might cause. But even if the company were not motivated by such foresight, it would still be forced to rate their premiums up drastically or cancel their coverage altogether in order to avoid carrying the extra risk invoked in their inclination to violence. In a competitive economy, no insurance company could afford to continue covering aggressors and those who had dealings with aggressors and simply pass the cost on to its honest customers; it would soon lose these customers to more reputable firms which could afford to charge less for their insurance coverage.
