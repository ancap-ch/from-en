Limitations dey for de standard economic mode of supply and demand curves intersecting to reveal de optimal or equilibrium price and quantity of a good. Those limitations, as Austrians dey well aware, dey due to unrealistic. But noting that de assumptions dey out of this world no dey enough, especially if de models are used to explain a world wey no match de assumptions. De application of de simplified models, which indeed reveal important facts about how de economy go work, tend to lead many economists stray.

# Increasing Costs to Producers Does Not Increases Prices

A [recent EconTalk Episode](http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2017/02/tom*wainwright.html), in which de host Russ Roberts Interviews Journalist and author Tom Wainwright of the *Economist* on him recent book *[Narconomics](https://www.amazon.com/Narconomics-How-Run-Drug-Cartel/dp/1610395832/?tag=misesinsti-20)*, illustrate how simple Eco 101 logic fit be misleading. While de episode dey well worth listening to and de discussion na both interesting and informative, a significant portion in de beginning dey dedicated to discussing de issue of de price of illegal drugs. Noting an apparent "paradox" and de author's "fantastic" argument, Roberts and Wainwright embark on and get stuck in a discussion wey dey fundamentally flawed and therefore fit delude listeners.

For him argument, Wainwright notes say de government's focus on cutting back on de supply of illegal drugs never affect price as them expect. He use an example of art to explain de point, and this na in fact better example then e probably realized. Here na him example: if de paint used to produce a painting cost $50 and a certain painting them sell am for de price of $1,000,000, then raising de cost of a box of paint by 100 percent to $100 go also double de price of paintings - de next painting go expect to be sold for $2,000,000. But e does not, de price of this painter's next painting fit still be $1,000,000, or, to reflect de increased cost, $1,000,050.

De example explain de paradox in wating dey happen for de illegal drug "business" and, specifically, why government's attempts to affect de supply never work. Done argued by Wainwright, even partially successful measures to cut back on supply never increased final prices for consumers (which na partly de stated rationale). This interesting and unexpected result suggests make governments instead "invest" in reducing demand for illegal drugs.

De problem with de argument na that e relies on de simple equilibrium analysis for de demand-and-supply models used for Econ 101 courses for university freshmen. And e no actually apply here. Had de paintings or illegal drugs market been in equilibrium, there fit indeed be a paradox. But this is hardly de care, *especialy* in dis markets.

Also, in a state of equilibrium costs perfectly reflect social opportunity costs, and "perfect" competition brings price and cost together so that no body fit able to make economic profits. In other words, there is no difference between price and cost. Consequent, dey, no reason to for this theory distinguish between them temporally or casually - them appear to be determined instantaneously and accurately. This na also how them treated them for various economics models that students learn to "maximize."

# Price Drivers Cost - Not the Other Way Around

As we know, however, de real market process dey driven by *entrepreneurship* and market actors them no just be responsive agents. Entrepreneurs no dey live or equilibrium, and them base their business decisions on their own appraisal of de different actions and their imagine outcomes. For this real market, price drives cost - not de other way around. Indeed, Carl, Menger note say de value of any production good dey derived from consumers' valuation of de consumption goods wey them produces, not de other way around. This is also core to for example Mises's argument about economic calculation.

Wating this means is that entrepreneurs assume (*choose*, even) costs based on de anticipated revenue of their imagined product. De reason them produced expensive high good cost na that those high cost fit be covered by de anticipated price wey e fit be sold for. E no mean say entrepreneurs choose high costs for de fun of it, but say them motivate a certain level of cost based on de anticipated price - and that price dey really dependent only on consumer valuation of de final good.

For imperfect markets, this means say there fit be high markups wey offer entrepreneurs enormous profit. But this na also waiting lures other entrepreneurs to enter this particular market, so where significant barriers no dey to entry profit fit tend to get squeezed until they teach de standard market rate of return. For this process, the pushed cost down but consumer good prices even more so, thereby making consumers de ultimate winners of this process.

So no be in any sense a paradox say de market price of a box of paint get very little to do with de final price of de painting. Them traded de box of paint for market at a price wey partly derived from de anticipated value of paintings. Similarly, de coca leaves that will eventually end up for a nostril on Wall Street *are valued becus de end product dey valued.*

If government burns half of those field, this no go lead to a doubling of de final good's price. Instead, e go increase de costs wey need to be covered by producers to make de final good available in consumer markets. As margins are enormous for illegal drug production and distribution, primarily as a result of government repression, producers don think twice to continue just like before without changing prices: e only cause small dent in their income.

For Wainwright's example, a kilo of cocaine, with a market value of $100,000 if them sell am for "tiny portion," e produced from a ton of fresh coca leaf sell am at a price of $500. De refined product sells at $1,000 for Columbia, and to "distributors" for de United states for $15-20,000. For this situation, if de field of some coca farmer dey burned, those farmer lose all their revenue while prices of de remaining product fit potentially be bid up (assuming some form of market). How much those prices are bid up depend on de [ reservation price](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservation*price) of existing cocaine producers and de chance of new entrants. E no cause any proportional ripple effect throughout de supply chain.

This dey easy to see if we adopt de Austrian view wey pricing of production goods them do am "backward" through entrepreneurial biddinig aiming for anticipated consumer prices. But using de supply-and-demand schedule for equilibrium prices fit produce a fundamentally flawed analysis - even by those who recognize sey de assumptions dey unrealistic (which Roberts naturally do).

This no be to say that de prices within de cocaine supply chain are not some form of equilibrium prices. De assumption of partial equilibrium no be wating make de analysis flawed. De error lies for failing to recognize say cost (that is, de existence and shape o supply) na function of de anticipated price (demand) o de final good.

From this follows that changes in factor prices no dey necessarilly reflect for prices of consumer goods, especially for de short term. Rather, they will be reflect am for de profit margins of producers, and fit thus cause them to change their behavor.
