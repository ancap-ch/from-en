## We Don Visit De Null Zone Again

For where dis book start, I talk about one way wey we go take look how we dey process truth, I even compare am to physics. From de small truth of how we dey catch baseball, we go reach de "big truth dem" of physics – and de big truth dem nor go fit contradict de small truth dem.

Na so e be for morality. From de small truth of "make I nor kill" we go fit reach de big truth dem like "to use force dey morally wrong".

Inside de area of physics, religion na de main barrier wey don dey block logical opinion of truth from de experience wey we get and universal theory.

Just imagine, no man don ever  experience perfect circle directly – dat kind entity dey only exist for imagination and for mathematics, but we nor fit see am for our mind, or experience am for real life. e no any place for nature wey we know wey perfect circle dey exist, weda na for de small truth of we own experience or de big truth of physics.

Howeva, for thousand years, na de quest for dis perfect circle wey cripple de science of astronomy. planetary orbits dem suppose be perfect circle, cos baba God nor go create wetin nor dey perfect like half circle.

De problem wey dis approach get na – na only one problem – na say mars dey move go back. If you look Mars from dis planet wey we dey, e be like e dey move "backward" as earth dey always overtake am wen dem dey go round de sun.  de false believe wey people bin get say earth na im be de center of solar system, and de how people bin dey desperate to see perfect circle, come cause the Ptolemaic system of astronomy, wey come multiply all the perfect circle so tey e nor come make sense again, so dat dem go fit record elliptical orbit and also talk record say mars dey move backwards.

Why dis fake belief of perfection come be de requirement for all de things wey dey for sky? true true de evidence say  moon body get small small hole dem, be like e dey show say heaven nor dey perfect, but cos of religion people nor agree to see de evidence  say our planet and ode planet dem nor dey perfect. wen Galileo discover moon-mountain sunspot and Jupiter moon, dem talk sey im dey talk wetin dey against dia belief.

We turn dis study to de question of weda God dey exist.

We nor get any direct, empirical, or clear evidence of weda God dey or not. de biggest abstract measurement wey scientist dem don do nor show any evidence say God dey eida – yet for inside de truth of wetin we don experience wey be say God nor dey and de most scientific abstract measurement and tori dem – wey also confirm say God nor dey – one kind "null zone" dey come into existence wey dey turn all standard of truth upside down.

### Bigotry

Beliefs go fit be true, false or anti-truth. Na true belief say Sahara desert dey for North Africa; and na false belief say Sahara dey for Scotland; and na anti-truth belief Sahara na anytin wey I want am to be, and anywhere I want am na dere e go dey. De first belief na true, de second one na lie, – de third one na statement from person wey nor believe wetin oda people believe wey dey make de idea of proof to cast.

We fit talk say:

1. Propsition X na true cos dat one na fact
2. Proposition Y na lie cos e nor make sense.
3. Proposition Z na true cos I want am to be true. 

De third statement dey contradict im sef. "Truth" nor dey depend on wetin we want, since de meaning of wetin we want na subjective preference, and de meaning of truth na for idea dem to follow objective standard dem of logic and empirical reality.  to say sometin na true  cos you want am to be true, na like to make subjectivity dey equal with objectivity, and dat one na statement wey dey contradict im sef. 

Bigoted tori - or "faith" – by wetin e mean na sometin wey we nor fit test, since dem nor be belief if we nor get evidence, but dem only be belief if we nor follow reason and evidence.

We fit believe things wey nor dey proven but wey come turn to be true – person wey nor get doubt think say de world dey round before im even prove am – but de "null zone" na place wey we dey get belief on top things wey nor fit turn out to be *truth*..

If I tok say two plus two dey equal to five, dat one mean say I dey make mistake wey fit dey corrected with reference to logic. If I follow talk say square fit dey in form of circle, e mean say I dey make statement wey nor rhyme sef and e nor make any sense.
If I continue to dey talkk, come talk say
foo plus tury na same thing as desty” – come refuse to explain any of those obonge gramma  e mean say I dey make statement wey no follow at all.

### De next place we go stop: Na de "Alternative Universe"

de way wey people dey try to “save” dem belief wey no make sense at all na to just for “alternate realm” or “alternate universe” wey be say anytin wey dem believe go dey true.

If I talk say: “square circle dey”, I dey try talk wetin nor dey possible for dis world. Dat one mean say, if I stand gidigba for my tori, I get to form new world  wey dey “outside” d world wey  square circle fit dey.

If I come form  world wey be say my own beliefs dey equal to wetin dey true, dat one mean say I fit come talk say people wey nor believe say square circle dey nor dey reason well , cos dem nor dey reason wetin dey possible.

If we consider wetin dem call “null zone”, na only two possibilities  really dey. na either dis null zone dey on im own and e no relate wit dis world and we nor fit measure am or find am in any way, or shape or form- or at a time we go fit find, den relate with dis our magic world wey say our belief go dey equal to wetin dey true.

If, time come reach wey be say e come be say we fit come dey relate with dis null zone, den we fit get direct feeling wey be like to touch sometin wey mean say e dey exist. Dis one follow mean say, e gats enter our real world anyhow wey e be. But stilll, d moment wey be say we fit find am for dis our real world..e gats dey real like everytin wer we fit feel and see. So dis oda world wey wan enta our real world nor fit create space wey go let our real world gree say square circle dey real

We fit come dey sure say if we dey able to find dis oda world, evidence wey we don get nor go support de belief wey  we dey believe. Square circles, gods and oda tori wey we dey believe nor fit hide for dere, even like wen dem talk about leprechauns get wet dreams.

For anoda mata, if e come be say we no fit eva find out dis oda world and everytin wey we dey yarn na theory wey nor get evidence or wetin to carry back am up, den we fit talk say na like bag wey we fit just dey put things wey nor dey true.

[^1]: dis tori get to end for dose pipo mata wey talk say Einsteinian physics nor dey possible becos  de world nor fit dey round, blah blah blah. wetin nor dey certain for wetin dey inside am in content – as in theory – suppose dey equal with wetin nor dey certain for how dem carry dey run am, as in reason and evidence. De fact say mathematical tori fit dey wrong nor mean say principles of mathematics dey wrong but e dey confam am.
