2. “Logic” na set of objective and rules wey dey consistent wey dem derive from the consistency of reality.
3. All those theory wey follow with logic, dem dey call am “valid”.
4. All those theories wey dem don confirm by empirical testing, dem dey call am “accurate”.
5. All those theories wey dey valid, com still dey accurate, dem dey call am “true”.
6. Them require “Preferences” for life, thought, language and all those debating.
7. Debating always need may both parties hold “truth” and may dem dey objective and dem go prefer am universally.
8. Therefore, that very act of debating wey we dey do contain an acceptance of universally preferable behavior (UPB).
9. Theories regarding UPB must pass the tests of logical consistency and empirical verification.
10. The subset of UPB wey dey examine behavior  wey dem fit enforce is called “morality”
11. As e com be subset of UPB, e no get any moral theory wey them go fit consider as true if e dey illogical or empirical evidence no support am.
12. Moral theories wey dey supported by logic and evidence na true. All the rest moral theories no be true.
