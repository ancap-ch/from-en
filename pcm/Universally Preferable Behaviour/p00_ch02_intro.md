## Introduction dem

For many of dem generations, man pikin dey live for one kyn egocentric womb ignorance wey be say na dem do am: d world dey flat, d sun, moon, and dem stars dey rotate round am, im old ones wey don pass dey call am from beyond dem mists of death, and thunder na d vex of dem gods.

Burrowing out from dis narcissitic womb of subjective interpretation require d labour of millennia – and cost plenty lives of person we yenta millions. D effort wey dey required to struggle dem our perspective from *perceptual experience* to *conceptual logic* dey fear person, exhilarating, dey scatter person brain and dey very very dangerous. To grab say d world no dey as e *felt like*, or *seemed like*, dey – and e go be – d greatest tin of our intelligence. D *truth* of reality don turn to be say e dey for d eyes of d mind, not d flesh.

D world wan look like say e dey flat; dem no dey. D sun and d moon wan be like say dem be d same; dem no be. D stars wan be like say dem dey rotate round d earth; dem no dey. To sabi d truth mean say we go see d world from anoda angle – dis wan no mean say we go reject our senses dem, but an airtight compliance wit d *real* evidence of dem senses, wey be say d world no flat, but wetin matter, energy and physical laws dem dey sepe. Wen we leave a rock wey dey our hand, e go fall down – dis na d *real* evidence of dem senses, no be say d earth dey one place or e no fit move. D idea say d world no fit move no be correct assumption as e no gel wit d direct evidence of our senses dem, wey be dat evry evry falls. If evry evry falls, d world no fit dey one place and no fit move.

Dis na d shikini truths for evry day; dat dem rocks fall, smoke wey rise, fire dey hot and dem sun and moon gada dey round. If we dey steadfastly and dey rigorously commited to dis “little truths,” wit tym we fit get am for d great truths of physics, wey dey provide us wit dt kyn knowledge and power.

For middle off dem shikini truths and dem great truths, however, na dem illusion wey cover our eyes – for both physics and ethics dem

For physics. D great truths no fit different from d little truths. No “unified field theory” fit orjjo different for our direct sense-experience of rock wey dey fall or flame wey dey rise. D mathematical theory wey great pass no fit be orijo if wen u dey apply am e dey return incorrect change for d checkout counter.

For dem old tori, however, for middle of our own shikini truths and d great truths dey wetin dem dey call “null zone.”

### D "Null Zone"

We dey tell our pikin make dem no blow each oda, and we tink say violence no good for d abstract, as a moral rule ery dey for evry evry. D “little truth” na: *no blow*. D “great truth” na: *violence no good*.

However, one entity dey exist wey dey imaginary wey dem dey call “God,” and dem dey look dis entity say n aim be d ogbonge moral. Unfortunately, dis entity dey always and plenty tyms dey no dey respect d edict dat “violence no good” by drowning d world, dey put souls to hell despite say im don sabi dia “decisions,” before, dey sanction rape, murder, dey steal, assault and oda actions wey we dey talk say na very bad tin for any man pikin.

Thus we get d shikini truth (*don’t punch*) and d great truth (*violence is wrong*) but for d middle, we get dis “null zone” *wia d complete opposite of both dem our shikini truths and our great truths dey considered say dem be ogbonge true*.

For dem old tori, we fit see d same inconsistency for physics. No perfect circle dey for our direct experience, but because say of a belief for God syd, all dem planetary motion dey always be a “perfect circle” – a area wey carry astronomy go back for centuries. For same tin, if a man turn im head, he no dey reasonably accept say d world dey rotate round im – and he go happy to put am forward no be for im own “little truth,” but as a *great truth*, or universal principle dem, Yet for most of dem human old tori, dem don accept say dem stars and de planets dey rotate round d earth, rada dan say na d world dey rotate. For dis place again we fit see d “null zone” between dem direct sense and universally principle, wey be say all dem opposite principles na im dem talk say be ogbonge orijo.

No normal person experiences god directly. For im daily life, he accept say *that which cannot be perceived does not exist*. No reasonable man dey fear wen e dey waka, tinkin say one wall wey e no fit see fit com block im way. Dem greatest abstractions of science dey for dis approach back gidigba.

Conversely, for d “null zone” of religion dem, d *exact opposite* of both d shikini truths and d great truths na im dem accept say e true. Personally, a man dey accept say *that which cannot be perceived does not exist* - imtellectually, science don prove dis evry evry time. However, for d “null zone” of theology, na d exact opposie proposition carry true – d axiom wey de y na *that which cannot be perceived **must** exist*.

Our belief for d virtue of dem military dey for dis “null zone.” If dem giv a private man ego make im go kill anoda man, we dey call im “gun for hire,” and dey condemn im say im be hit man. If, however, dis man wearm am for green costume com put some ribbons *and commits the same act*, we go dey hail am say na badoo and com give am pension. D shikini truth (*I should not murder*) dey ogbonge consistent wit d great truth (*murder is wrong*) – yet for d middle na “null zone,” dey wia to dey kill don turn “virtuous.”

If dis “null zone” na ogbonge, den no logical proposition fit dey. If a proposition dey true – and d exact opposite of dat proposition dey true too – den logical reasoning no possible o. D growth of dem normal science na d one wey dey attack dis “null zone,” wella and d incursion of objective consistency indo dis craze shikini pockets dem of subjective whim.

For dem old maps, before dem cartographers finish dia explorations, d drawings of dem known lands go comot turn blank paper. D growth of knowledge dey require first a delineation of wetin dem no sabi, and den an expansion of principles wey dem know into d areas wey dem neva know.

TD same dey true for d realm of morality

### D casualties

Crossing dis “null zone” dey plenty wit gobe. D road from dem shikini truths to dem great truths dey paved wit dem bones of millions. From d peme of Socrates reach d torture of dem early scientists by dem religious zealots, to d millions who don kill and peme dor d black fantasies of fascism and communism, any forward-thrust of human wey grab into d “null zone” dey plenty wit many gobe.

Go “crossing the null zone” by force - or to seamlessly carry d shikini truths wit d great truths togeda - for sure e go dey hard and gobe? Na very big challend to caryy togeda d perpetual wit d conceptual for a straight line of logical reasoning - but *must* dis progress come take plenty years wey reach thousands and plenty plenty blood so?

If we look at the technological and economic progress of mankind, we see more or less a flat line for countless millennia, followed by massive and asymptotic spikes over the past few hundred years. It is inconceivable that some widespread genetic mutation could account for this sudden and enormous acceleration of intellectual consistency and material success. Theories claiming that a certain “snowball effect” came into existence, mysteriously propelled by an accumulation of all the little increments of knowledge that had occurred since the dawn of civilisation, can usually be dismissed out of hand as entirely *ex post facto* explanations, since they have no predictive value.

If we understand that our staggering potential has been available to us for at least tens of thousands of years – and that there is both great profit and great pleasure in exercising it – then it at once becomes clear that we really *do* want to use our amazing minds.

Thus there must be a downward force that has historically acted to crush and enslave the natural liberty of mankind.

In the realm of science, it is not too hard to see the oppressive forces that continually kept our minds in near-primeval ignorance. The combination of superstition in the form of religion, and violence in the form of the aristocracy, threatened rational thinkers with intimidation, imprisonment, torture, and murder. Just as a farmer profits from the low intelligence of his cows, and a slave-owner profits from the fear of his slaves, priests and kings retained their privileges by threatening with death anyone who dared to think.

The simple truth is that “priests” and “kings” were – and are – merely men. The simple truth is that the gods and devils that were supposed to justify their rule never existed.

We have made great strides in understanding the nature and reality of simple human equality, but the sad fact of the matter is that the realm of *morality* is still lost in the “null zone” – in the destructive illusions of the “middle truths.”

### "Middle Truths"

Let us call the oppositional principles that reside in the “null zone” – between sense perception and conceptual consistency – the “middle truths.”

These “middle truths” are the most dangerous illusions of all, because they grant the *appearance* of truth while actually *attacking* the truth.

By providing the illusion that we have found the truth, “middle truths” actually prevent us from gaining the truth. They are the last line of defence for fantasy, predation and exploitation.

Since they are not only irrational, but *anti*-rational, “middle truths” remain endlessly flexible – as long as they serve those in power. For instance, Christianity arose out of the growing fascism of the late Roman Empire partly by lashing out at the “primitive” superstitions of existing theologies. “Forget your old gods, we have a brand new God who is far better!”

“Middle truths” always take the form of a truth, followed by a lie. “Zeus is a pagan superstition” is a true statement, which was openly made by Christian proselytisers. The lie that followed was: “Yahweh is not a pagan superstition, but a real and living God.”

We can personalise this a little bit more with an example that will be familiar to anyone who has ever counselled a dysfunctional friend. “My last boyfriend was a real jerk,” she will say, and you will fervently agree. “My new boyfriend is really *great* though,” she will add, and you will try not to roll your eyes.

It is very hard not to replace one illusion with another.

“The British government is a tyranny!” cried the American revolutionaries in the eighteenth century – and, after evicting the British troops, they then set up their own government and started attacking their own citizens.

“Aristocracy is an unjust abomination!” cried other revolutionaries, who then set up the tyranny of the majority in the form of democracy.

“Middle truths” can also exist in science, and similarly prevent the natural progress from the little truths to the great truths. Until the eighteenth century, for instance, biologists believed in “spontaneous generation,” or the idea that life can spring from nonliving matter. This had never been observed, of course, but conformed to ancient writings both philosophical and religious, and so was accepted as fact. Also, prior to the Einsteinian revolution in 1905, light was believed to move through a fixed and invisible substance called “luminiferous ether,” just as sound waves move through air. No scientist who believed in this theory had any empirical evidence for this “ether,” either personally or scientifically – but it was considered necessary to conform to other observable characteristics.

Religion is also another “middle truth” – one of the most dangerous ones. It is true that we are a unique species in the universe, as far as we know. A giraffe is a taller quadruped, but man is not just a “smarter” primate, but something quite different. The nature of that difference remains largely unknown – the religious explanation of “we are not the same as animals because we have a soul and were created by a God” is just another example of a “middle truth.” It is true that we are very different from animals. It is not true that we were created by a god and have a soul.

Just as some parasites cannot take root until they dislodge the prior parasites, “middle truths” only attack previous illusions *so that they can take their place*. Those who are sceptical of the prior fantasies are drawn towards the new fantasy. Thus does Christianity displace paganism, Marxism displace Christianity, post-modernism displace Marxism, democracy displace aristocracy, and so on.

Until the great truths are achieved, and united with the little truths, “middle truths” are just a rotating phalanx of exploitive and destructive falsehoods – specifically designed to prevent the achievement of the great truths.

And the great truths are always achieved from the little truths.

The world falls because a rock falls.

### "Middle Truths" And Exploitation

Biologically, parasitism is a wholly viable survival strategy for many creatures. In the absence of ethical norms, stealing energy and resources from other creatures is perfectly sensible. In general, the most sustainable and stable form of parasitism is *symbiosis*, or mutually beneficial coexistence. Thus the bacteria that inhabit our intestines aid their own survival by helping us digest our food.

However, a virus that renders us continually exhausted, and barely able to keep ourselves alive, can scarcely be called “mutually beneficial.” If we think of our long and grim history of disaster, starvation, war, disease and poverty – and compare it with the astounding material successes of modernity – it is clear that a form of parasitism tyrannised our minds and capacities for millennia. Now that the last few hundred years have shown the power and creativity of the human spirit, we can view our species as an organism that has shaken off a terrible parasite, and sprung from an endless gasping deathbed to perform the most astounding feats of gymnastics.

When we cure ourselves of a disease, we feel better, but the disease does not. From the perspective of the smallpox virus, the smallpox vaccine is genocidal.

In the same way, the parasites that strangle mankind view the liberty of the majority with horror. Since their parasitism frees them from the demands of reality – to earn their daily bread – they inevitably view the freedom of the masses as a form of enslavement for themselves. Thus would a farmer view the “liberation” of his livestock as an utter disaster…

Establishing truth necessarily limits fantasy. Limiting fantasy necessarily limits exploitation. If I can convince you that I am a living man-God, and that the God who birthed me wants you to give me ten percent of your income, or you will be punished for eternity, then I can become exceedingly rich. I am a parasite of illusions, and depend on those illusions for my sustenance as surely as fungus relies on warmth, dampness – and darkness.

Those who use moral fantasies to exploit mankind have always fought tooth and nail against those who threaten their livelihood by discovering and disseminating the truth.

We are familiar with the example of the Mafia, which threatens potential rivals with maiming and death, or the spectacle of religious sects attacking each other, or one government attacking another.

When philosophers expose the falsehoods necessary for continued exploitation, however, they are ideally not aiming to set themselves up as competitors. They do not wish to *replace* the Mafia, or the church – they wish to eliminate it completely.

A more modern analogy would be the relationship between the state, lobbyists and taxpayers. Lobbyists will ferociously attack other lobbyists who compete for the same tax dollars. However, imagine how *all* lobbyists would band together to attack anyone who proposed eliminating the state as an institution.

Parasites will aggressively compete with one another for the host’s limited resources – but it is in their best interest to band together to attack anything that threatens to eliminate the host itself.

In this way, in any society where the state and the church are nominally separated, each entity tends to compete for adherents. Where the church begins to lose ground, the state will aggressively recruit patriots – resulting in secular socialism. Where the state begins to lose ground, the church will aggressively recruit adherents – resulting in religious fundamentalism, often with tinges of libertarianism.

However, the philosophers who oppose *all* intellectual error are the sworn enemies of all the parasites that feed off illusions. The “great truths” of physics eliminate the need for supernatural agents, and render miracles impossible. The explanatory power of science wholly outshines the religious fictions that masquerade as knowledge about the physical world.

The scientific method requires that every thesis be supported by evidence and rationality. Since there is no evidence for gods – and the very *idea* of gods is innately self-contradictory – the thesis “gods exist” cannot stand. Inevitably, the religious parasites attempt to defend their thesis by trying to split reality into “two realms” – the scientific and the spiritual. However, there is no evidence for the existence of this “spiritual” realm in the present, any more than there was for the parallel universe of Platonic “Forms” two thousand five hundred years ago.

Thus the establishment of consistent and universal truth necessarily limits and destroys the exploitive potential of illusion. In particular, the “great truths,” which are universal and consistent, make redundant and ridiculous the “middle truths” – which are in fact exploitive fantasies. We are familiar with the “middle truth” of religion; a few others will be examined and revealed here, some of which may shock you.

### Effective Parasitism

The most effective parasites – or viruses – are those which fool the body into indifference. Our immune systems are designed to attack foreign substances within the body, isolating and killing them. We fear HIV and cancer in particular because they are able to bypass our immune systems. The same technique is used by intellectual parasites to disable the defence systems of those they prey upon.

If a stranger attacks you in an alley and demands your money, you will be horrified and appalled. You may fight back, you may run, or you may give him your wallet, but you would remain shocked, angry and frightened by the interaction. When you repeated the story, you would tell it in a way that reinforced the base and vile violation of your personal and property rights. Others would feel sympathy for your predicament, and would avoid said alley in the future.

This is an example of a “little truth,” which is: “Stealing from me is wrong.”

However, when a government agent sends you a letter demanding that you pay him money, you may feel a certain indignity, but you would not relate the story with the same horror and indignation to your friends.

This is an example of a “middle truth,” which obscures a “great truth,” which is that “stealing is wrong.”

This book will focus on exposing and destroying these false “middle truths.” I believe that mankind suffers endlessly under the tyranny of false ethical “middle truths” which justify the destructive world-views of religious superstition, secular despotism and the cult of the family.

My thesis in this book is that in ethics, as in every other intellectual discipline, the great truths arise directly from the little truths. The disorienting fog of the “middle truths” is a hellish path to navigate, but it is worth struggling through, because the only fundamental alternative to truth is exploitation, destruction – and, inevitably, the untimely demise of millions.
