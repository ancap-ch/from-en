## Introduction dem

For many of dem generations, man pikin dey live for one kyn egocentric womb ignorance wey be say na dem do am: d world dey flat, d sun, moon, and dem stars dey rotate round am, im old ones wey don pass dey call am from beyond dem mists of death, and thunder na d vex of dem gods.

Burrowing out from dis narcissitic womb of subjective interpretation require d labour of millennia – and cost plenty lives of person we yenta millions. D effort wey dey required to struggle dem our perspective from *perceptual experience* to *conceptual logic* dey fear person, exhilarating, dey scatter person brain and dey very very dangerous. To grab say d world no dey as e *felt like*, or *seemed like*, dey – and e go be – d greatest tin of our intelligence. D *truth* of reality don turn to be say e dey for d eyes of d mind, not d flesh.

D world wan look like say e dey flat; dem no dey. D sun and d moon wan be like say dem be d same; dem no be. D stars wan be like say dem dey rotate round d earth; dem no dey. To sabi d truth mean say we go see d world from anoda angle – dis wan no mean say we go reject our senses dem, but an airtight compliance wit d *real* evidence of dem senses, wey be say d world no flat, but wetin matter, energy and physical laws dem dey sepe. Wen we leave a rock wey dey our hand, e go fall down – dis na d *real* evidence of dem senses, no be say d earth dey one place or e no fit move. D idea say d world no fit move no be correct assumption as e no gel wit d direct evidence of our senses dem, wey be dat evry evry falls. If evry evry falls, d world no fit dey one place and no fit move.

Dis na d shikini truths for evry day; dat dem rocks fall, smoke wey rise, fire dey hot and dem sun and moon gada dey round. If we dey steadfastly and dey rigorously commited to dis “little truths,” wit tym we fit get am for d great truths of physics, wey dey provide us wit dt kyn knowledge and power.

For middle off dem shikini truths and dem great truths, however, na dem illusion wey cover our eyes – for both physics and ethics dem

For physics. D great truths no fit different from d little truths. No “unified field theory” fit orjjo different for our direct sense-experience of rock wey dey fall or flame wey dey rise. D mathematical theory wey great pass no fit be orijo if wen u dey apply am e dey return incorrect change for d checkout counter.

For dem old tori, however, for middle of our own shikini truths and d great truths dey wetin dem dey call “null zone.”

### D "Null Zone"

We dey tell our pikin make dem no blow each oda, and we tink say violence no good for d abstract, as a moral rule ery dey for evry evry. D “little truth” na: *no blow*. D “great truth” na: *violence no good*.

However, one entity dey exist wey dey imaginary wey dem dey call “God,” and dem dey look dis entity say n aim be d ogbonge moral. Unfortunately, dis entity dey always and plenty tyms dey no dey respect d edict dat “violence no good” by drowning d world, dey put souls to hell despite say im don sabi dia “decisions,” before, dey sanction rape, murder, dey steal, assault and oda actions wey we dey talk say na very bad tin for any man pikin.

Thus we get d shikini truth (*don’t punch*) and d great truth (*violence is wrong*) but for d middle, we get dis “null zone” *wia d complete opposite of both dem our shikini truths and our great truths dey considered say dem be ogbonge true*.

For dem old tori, we fit see d same inconsistency for physics. No perfect circle dey for our direct experience, but because say of a belief for God syd, all dem planetary motion dey always be a “perfect circle” – a area wey carry astronomy go back for centuries. For same tin, if a man turn im head, he no dey reasonably accept say d world dey rotate round im – and he go happy to put am forward no be for im own “little truth,” but as a *great truth*, or universal principle dem, Yet for most of dem human old tori, dem don accept say dem stars and de planets dey rotate round d earth, rada dan say na d world dey rotate. For dis place again we fit see d “null zone” between dem direct sense and universally principle, wey be say all dem opposite principles na im dem talk say be ogbonge orijo.

No normal person experiences god directly. For im daily life, he accept say *that which cannot be perceived does not exist*. No reasonable man dey fear wen e dey waka, tinkin say one wall wey e no fit see fit com block im way. Dem greatest abstractions of science dey for dis approach back gidigba.

Conversely, for d “null zone” of religion dem, d *exact opposite* of both d shikini truths and d great truths na im dem accept say e true. Personally, a man dey accept say *that which cannot be perceived does not exist* - imtellectually, science don prove dis evry evry time. However, for d “null zone” of theology, na d exact opposie proposition carry true – d axiom wey de y na *that which cannot be perceived **must** exist*.

Our belief for d virtue of dem military dey for dis “null zone.” If dem giv a private man ego make im go kill anoda man, we dey call im “gun for hire,” and dey condemn im say im be hit man. If, however, dis man wearm am for green costume com put some ribbons *and commits the same act*, we go dey hail am say na badoo and com give am pension. D shikini truth (*I should not murder*) dey ogbonge consistent wit d great truth (*murder is wrong*) – yet for d middle na “null zone,” dey wia to dey kill don turn “virtuous.”

If dis “null zone” na ogbonge, den no logical proposition fit dey. If a proposition dey true – and d exact opposite of dat proposition dey true too – den logical reasoning no possible o. D growth of dem normal science na d one wey dey attack dis “null zone,” wella and d incursion of objective consistency indo dis craze shikini pockets dem of subjective whim.

For dem old maps, before dem cartographers finish dia explorations, d drawings of dem known lands go comot turn blank paper. D growth of knowledge dey require first a delineation of wetin dem no sabi, and den an expansion of principles wey dem know into d areas wey dem neva know.

TD same dey true for d realm of morality

### D casualties

Crossing dis “null zone” dey plenty wit gobe. D road from dem shikini truths to dem great truths dey paved wit dem bones of millions. From d peme of Socrates reach d torture of dem early scientists by dem religious zealots, to d millions who don kill and peme dor d black fantasies of fascism and communism, any forward-thrust of human wey grab into d “null zone” dey plenty wit many gobe.

Go “crossing the null zone” by force - or to seamlessly carry d shikini truths wit d great truths togeda - for sure e go dey hard and gobe? Na very big challend to caryy togeda d perpetual wit d conceptual for a straight line of logical reasoning - but *must* dis progress come take plenty years wey reach thousands and plenty plenty blood so?

If we look at dem technological and economic increase of man pikin, we go see plenty or small a flat line for millenia wey dem no fit count, wey be say na boku and asymptotic spikes follow am for d few hundred years wey pass. E dey somehow say some genetic mutation wey spread for evry evry fit be say na im cause for dis sharpaly and biggy biggy acceleration of intellectual consistency dem and dem material success. Theories wey dey claim say na one kyn “snowball effect” na im com into existence, wey com mysteriously propel by dem accumulation of all d shikini increments of knowledge wey don dey since d tym of civilisation, fit just forget am out of hand say na *ex post facto* explanations dem, since dem no get predictive value.

If we grab say our potential wey dey shake don dey for use for tens of thousands of years dem - and say boku profit dey and boku pleasure wen u dey exercise am - den e go com clear say we really *do* wan use our minds wey dey amazing.

So dia go be a force wey dey drag tin down wey don dey for old tym to crush and make im enslave d natural liberty of man pikin.

For dem science realm so, e no too hard to see d oppressive forces wey dey put our mind for near-primeval ignorance. D combination of supersition wey carry rreligion form, and kasala wey carry aristocracy form,threatened normal tinkers dem wit intimidation, imprisonment, torture, and peme. Just as a farmer dey profit from d shikini brain wey im cows get, and person wey get slave dey profit from d fear wey dey im slaves mind, dem prists and kings dey retain dia privileges by threatening say anyone wey tink go peme.

D simple truth be say “priests” and “kings” be - and dem be - ordinary men. D simple truth be say dem gods and devils wey suppose justify dia rule no exist at all. 

We don make great strides to grab d nature and d reality of simple man pikin equality, but d tin wey dey pain for d matter na say d realm of *morality* still dey lost for “null zone” - for d destructive illusions of d “middle truths.”

### "Truths wey dey Middle"

Make we call dem oppositional principles wey dey reside for d “null zone” – wey dey middle of sense perception and conceptual consistency - d “truths wey dey middle.” 

Dis “truths wey dey middle.” na d illusions wey dey gobe pass, because dey grant d *appearance* of truth wey be say na *attacking* d truth dem dey actually do. 

By giving d illusion say we don sabi d truth, “truths wey dey middle.” dey actually stop us to get am for d truth. Na dem be d last line of defence for dem fantasy, predation and to dey use person brain.

Since no be only craze dem be, but *anti*-normal, “truths wey dey middle.” go everly dey flexible - as long say dem dey serve dose wey dey power. Make we look dis now, Christianity small part com from d growing fascism of d Roman empire wey don go so by lashing out at d “primitive” superstitions of dem existing theologies. “Forget ur old gods dem, we don get tear rubber God wey beta pass una own!”   

“Truths wey dey middle” dey always take truth form , den na lie go follow. “Zeus na pagan superstition im be” na true talk, wey be say na for public dem Christian proselytisers voice am. D lie wey follow am na: “Yahweh no be pagan superstition, but na confam and God wey dey live.”

We fit personalise dis one shikini wit example wey evry evry go sabi especially person wey don counsell a dysfunctional padi. “My boyfriend wey pass na real jerk,” she go say, and you go sharp sharp accept am. “My new boyfriend dey really *great* though,” she go add, and u no go wan roll ur eyes.

E dey hard to replace one illusion wit anoda.

“D British government just dey oppress!” na im d American revolutionaries dey shout for d eighteenth century - and after dey don pursue d British troops dem, dey com start dia own government and com dey attack dia own country people dem. 

“Aristocracy na unjust abomination!” na im d oda revolutionaries dey shout, na who com start d oppression of dem majority wey com for democracy form.

“Truths wey dey middle” fit dey for science too, and similarly stop d natiral increase from d shikini truth reach d great truths dem. Until d eighteenth century, make we look dis now, dem biologists dey believe in “spontaneous generation,” or d idea say lyf fit comot for somtin wey no get lyf. Dem neva observe am o, for sure, but e dey same wit dem old writings dem both dem philosphical and religious, and so dem accept am say na fact. Also before d Einsteinian revolution for 1905, dem believe say light fit move through somtin wey no dey move, and wey u no fit see wey dem dey call “luminiferous ether,” just as dem sound waves dey move through air so. No scientists wey believe dis theory get any empirical evidence for dis “ether,” make e be personally or na scientifically - but dem see am say e dey necessary to conform wit dem oda characteristicss wey dem fit see.

Religion na anoda “truth wey dey middle” too - one of dem gobe ones/ Na true say we be special species for dis universe, as far wetin we sabi. A girrafe tall pass 4 time of man pikin, but man no be only “smarter” primate, but somtin dey we just different. D nature of dat difference na im dem no sabi. - d religious explanation of “we no be d same lyk dem animals because say we get soul and na God create us” Religion self na anoda “truth wey dey middle.” Na true say we no be d same wit dem animals. No be true say na God create us and say we get soul.

Just as some parasites dem no fit get root until dem gaz remove dem parasites wey been dey dia before, “truths wey dey middle” dey attck only dem illusions wey don pass *so dey fit come collect dia place*. Dose wey no too believe d fantasies wey pass are drawn to d new fantasy, So na so Christianity com displace paganism dem, Marxism com displace Christianity dem, post-modernism com displace Marxism, democracy displace aristocracy dem, and na so e dey go.

Until dem achieve d greath truths, and com join am wit d shikini truths, “truths wey dey middle” go just be a rotating phalanx of exploitive and destructive falsehoods dem - wey dem design specifically to stop wetin great truths wan achieve.

And dem great truths na from dem shikini truths dem dey achieve am.

D world falls because say a rock falls.

 ### “Truths wey dey middle” And To dey use person brain

Biologically, parasitism na wholly a survival strategy wey dey possible for plenty creatures dem.  As ethical norms no dey, to dey steal energy and resources from oda creatures dem dey perfectly sensible. in evry evry, d type parasitism wey dey sustainable and stable pass na *symbiosis*, or somtin wey both tin wey dey dia dey enjoy. So d bacteria wey dey our intestine dey helep us digest d food wey we chop and e dey helep dem dey alive.

However, a virus wey dey always leave us to dey tire, and wey na small we no peme, no fit to dey call am “Somtin wey both tin dey enjoy.” If we tink am for d long and grim old tori of disaster, starvation, war, disease and no money - make we com compare am wit d astounding material success for now - e dey clear say one form of parasitism dey tyrannise our mind and capacities for millenia dem. For d few hundred years wey don pass don show d power and d creativity wey dey d man pikin spirit, we fit see our species say na organism wey don comot parasite wey bad, and don comot from deathbed wey be like for lyf com perform astounding feats for gymnastics dem.

Wen we cure ourself of a disease so, we go feel beta, but d disease no go feel beta. If we look am for smallox virus angle, d vaccine for small pox dem na die.

For d same way, d parasites wey dey strangle man pikin dey see d liberty of d majority wit horror. Since dia parasitism don free dem from d demands of dem reality - to dey earn wetin dem go chop evry day - dem see d freedom of d masses say na way of enslavement for demselves so. So shey a farmer go see d “liberation” of im livestock as total gbese…

To establish truth dey reduce fantasy. To dey limit fantasy mean say e go dey reduce using of person brain. If I fit convince u say na me be God wey dey live as-man, and dat d God wey born me wan make u giv me ten percent for ur income, or na punishment u go get for life, den me go com rich well well. I be parasite of illusions dem, and na dat illusions me dey depend ontop for ma sustenance as fungus dey depend ontop warmth, dampness - and darkness so.

Dose wey dey use moral fantasies to dey use man pikin brain dey always fyt tooth and nail against dose wey dey threaten dia livelihood by sabi and to dey spread d truth.

We dey familiar wit d example of d Mafia, wey dey threaten potential rivals dem wsay dem go maim and kill dem, or d show of dem religious sects wey dey attack dem self, or one government wey dey attack dem self.

Wen dem philosophers com expose d lies wey dem dey use to dey use man pikin brain, however, dem no dey look say make dem be competitors. Dem no wish say dem wan *replace* d Mafia, or d church - dey wan remove am completely.

A beta analogy wey dey now go be d relationship wey dey between d state, dem lobbyists and dem taxpayers. Lobbyists go attack oda lobbyists dem wella who dey follow drag for d same tax dollar so. However, look am how *all* lobbyists go com join togeda com attack anyone wey tink say make dem comot d state as e be institution.

Parasites go vex com compete wit dem self for d host's resources wey no too plenty - but na for dia own best interest say make dem com join togeda com attack anything wey tink say e fit comot d host itself.

For dis way, for any area wey d state and d church no too dey togeda, each of dem entity go dey compete for loyal followers dem. Wia d church don dey lose ground, d state go dey vex dey recruit patriots dem - wey go turn to religious fundamentalism, wey dey wit d tinges of libertarianism.

However, dem philosphers wey no accept *all* intellectual mistake dem na d sworn enemies of all dem parasites wey dey feed off dem illusions. D “great truths” of physics don comot d need for dem supernatural agents, and dey put say miracles no dey possible. D explanatory power of science dem don outshine d religious fictions wey dey hide com talk say im be knowledge about d physical world. 

D scientific method need say make dem support evry thesis wit evidence and rationality. Since evidence no dey for dem gods - and d *idea* say dem gods dey contradict demself innately - d thesis say “gods exist” no fit dey. For sure, d religious parasites go wan try defend dia thesis as dem go wan divide reality into “two realms” - d scientific and d spiritual. However, evidence no dey say dis “spiritual” realm dey for now, any more dan dia was for d parallel universe of Platonic “Forms” towo thousand five years wey don pass. 

Thus d establishment of of consistent and d universal truth dey limit and dey destroy d expolitive potential of illusion dem. In particular, d “great truths,” wey dey universal and consistent, make e dey redundant and ridiculous d “truths wey dey middle” - wey be say dem be exploitive fantasies. We dey familiar wit d “truths wey dey middle” of religion; na just shikini odas we go examine and reveal hia, wey be say som of dem go surprise u so.

### Parasitism wey dey effective 

D parasitism wey dey effective pass - or dem viruses - na d ones wey dey fool d bodi into indifference. Dem do our immune system wey be say e fit attack anytin wey be jjc for our bodi, to separate and make dem kill dem. We dey fear HIV and cancer in particular because say dem fit bypass our immunne systems dem. Na d same technique intellectual parasites dey use to disable d defence systems of dose wey dem wan chop.

If a person wey u no sabi com attack u for one corner and ask for ur money, u go dey horrified and appalled. You fit fyt back, or make u pick race, or u fit giv am ur wallet, but u go dey shocked, vex and fear by d convo. Wen u dey talk d story wey happen again, u go talk am for a way wey reinforce d base and vle violation of ur own right and property rights dem. Odas go dey feel for ur wahala, and go tell u say make u dey avoide corner for future so.

Dis na example of a “shikini truth,” wey be: “to dey steal from me no dey ryt.”

However, when one government agent com send u letter say make u pay am ego, you go feel one kyn indignity, but u no go follow ur friends talk d tori wit d same horror and indignation.

Dis na example of “truth wey dey middle,” wey be “to dey steal no ryt.”

Dis book go focus to expose and destroy dis false “truths wey dey middle.” I believe say man pikin don too suffer under d tyranny of ethical wey no correct “truths wey dey middle” wey justify d destructive world-views of religious superstition dem, secular despotiam and d cult of d family dem.

Ma thesis for dis book na say fo ethics, as e dey for evry intellectual discipline dem, d greath truths dey arise straight from d little truths. D disorienting fog of d “truths wey dey middle” dem na one kyn hell part to pass, but e com worth d wahala, because d only fundamental alternative to truth na to dey use person brain, destruction - and, for sure, d peme of millions dem.
