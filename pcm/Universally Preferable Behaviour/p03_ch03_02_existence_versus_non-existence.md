### Wetin dey Practical

Once dem expose the violence wey dey inside government intellectually – and the “voluntarism” of citizens wey we be dey assume before go come dey revealed as fraud wey dey clear – the argument dey always come back say we *need* make government dey supply us with goods wey suppose dey public like protection, defence wey dey regional, roads etc.

I don write dozens of article wey dey expose the lie lie of this position, so I nor go bother to dey talk all those arguments again for here, since dem nor dey essential to the book wey concern morality, but instead, e go dey more appropriate for the book wey dey explain the principles and practicalities of society wey dey voluntary.[^4]

The “argument from practicality” no in any way dey solve the problems wey concern violence. If I see you dey chop cheeseburgers everyday, I fit tell you say e nor dey practical make you dey do like that, if you wan maintain weight wey dey healthy. I nor fit talk say e dey *evil* for you to dey chop cheeseburgers, for reasons wey we don go into already. I nor fit with good mind come force you to increase the “practicality” wey dey concerned to your actions.

Therefore if we dey talk say the government dey right if dem dey force us make we dey more “practical” na complete lie, wey dem don already verify for the UPB framework – even if we dey assume say government solutions dey more “practical”, and nor be so for real life.

Also, if people wey dey represent government dey claim say social contracts dey allow them to dey force population wey “nor dey practical” to dey behave more “practically”, we go don create contradiction wey we nor fit overcome.

If I force one woman make im marry one man wey I don choose for her, then e clear say I believe  say I get better judgement wey dey infinite about if the husband dey suitable for her pass as she want. In fact, I nor believe say she dey open to reason at all, or even get any clue about wetin go even interest her, because I *no* take account of wetin she go choose, but I dey force her make she marry the man wey I choose.

When I force this woman make she marry, I go fit only justify say na force I use – even on pragmatic grounds wey dey immediate – I go come claim say she nor dey fit mentally to choose wetin she like for matter wey concern marriage.

If the woman nor dey fit mentally to choose for herself for matter wey concern marriage, then e clear say she *nor also dey mentally fit to come choose person wey go dey help her choose*. If she nor get idea wetin dey make up husband wey dey good and suitable, den how she come tey fit check me  well as person wey go fit help her choose husband wey dey good for her?

If one man wey im intelligence dey extraordinarily low nor fit understand the concept of “health”, e go dey reasonable to expect am make im dey rational if e dey choose who go be im doctor? If we wan really choose doctor wey dey competent, we must to understand the concepts wey concern health, the efficacy, cost, professionalism and many other things. For the same way, if I nor allow woman make she talk at all for matter wey concern who she wan marry, then e clear say I must believe say she nor get any understanding of how dem tey dey know husband wey dey good, then she nor get any capacity to take transfer that choice give me, since she nor go get any way to take check the criteria of the good husband wey*I* choose for her.

If I nor fit decide the colour of paint wey I wan use for my house, and my answer na to sign contract with one painter wey go allow am to choose colour for me – and for that contract, I don sign all my freedoms wey dey future to tey disagree with wetin the painter go choose comot, and I don give am the right to kidnap and even enslave me if I nor agree to any of im decisions, or say I nor give am money for them – then e clear say I nor dey in sound mind. If I give person the power to tey dey force me *for the rest of my life*, then e clear say I nor believe say I dey competent to make decisions wey concern me.

If I nor think say I dey competent to make my own decisions, then e clear say my decisions to put myself under violence *for as long as I go live* na decision wey nor dey competent.

Either I dey capableto make decisions wey dey competent, or I nor dey. If I *dey* capable to dey make decisions wey dey competent, then to put myself under force for the remaining part of my life nor dey valid. If I *nor* dey capableto make decisions wey dey competent, then my decisions to put myself under force for the rest of my life nor still dey valid too.

Even if the things wey we consider for up dey somehow bypassed, however, e still dey impossible to justly carry out contract wey dey social pass through government. E clear say I nor fit sign contract for *your* behalf, or for my children behalf wey go dey binding on you or for the children for the rest of una lives. I nor go fit buy motor, den send you the bill, and come say make you pay for am. If I dey claim the power to put on top of una body contracts wey dey unilateral, UPB dey also grant *you* this power, and so you go just return the contract come give me wey carry my name.

For the same way, even if I by myself  choose to dey pay my own tax, I nor fit just force that choice put on top you, since contract wey dey voluntary na just personal preference, and so dem nor fit force am put for everybody body through violence.

### The Thing Wey Make The State Dey Necessary?

The whole question go come even dey more ludicrous if we dey look for the moral “justification” wey common pass for the power wey democratic governments get, wey dey based on the “will of people wey many pass”.

First of all, “will” na one aspect of person, while “majority” na tag for the group wey dey conceptual. The “majority” nor go come get “will” pass “chorus line” go fit “give birth”. If you dey doubt this thing, just try to build one tree house with the concept wey be “forest” instead of any pieces of wood wey dey one-one.

Two objections wey come add join dey constantly recur anytime the question of the necessity of government dey arise. The first one na say, society wey dey free go only dey possible if people dey perfectly good or if dem dey rational – for another word, say citizens go *need* government wey dey centralized because evil people dey this world.

The first problem and the one wey dey obvious pass with this position na say if evil people dey exist for the society, them go also dey exist for inside government – and them go come dey more dangerous like that. Citizens go fit protect themselves from individuals wey dey evil but them nor go fit stand government wey dey aggressive wey dey armed to the teeth wey come still get police and military power. Therefore the argument we talk say we need government because say people dey evil nor dey correct. If evil people dey exist, then them *must* dismantle the government, since dem fit bring in people wey dey evil make dem come use their power for wetin dem want – and, unlike private thugs, evil people wey dey inside government get police and military to flog the helpless (people wey nor carry arms) people better flogging. Therefore the argument na the same thing with the idea wey talk say “counterfeiters dey very dangerous, so make we nor provide monopoly wey dey exclusive over counterfeiting to one group of individuals wey no many”. Where for this earth people dey think say the counterfeiters go go first?[^5]

Logically, e get four possibilities wey dey if good and evil people for this world mix:

1. All men dey moral.
2. All men dey immoral.
3. Men wey plenty pass dey immoral, and the ones wey nor many dey moral.
4. Men wey plenty pass dey moral, and the ones wey nor many dey immoral.[^6]

For the first case (*all men dey moral*), e clear say dem nor need the government at all, since evil nor fit exist.

For the second case (*all men nor dey moral*), dem nor fit allow the government make e exist for one simple reason. The government, as dem dey argue am generally go exist because evil people dey this world wey dey want to dey harm people, and wey dem go fit hold through fear of retribution wey concern government (police, prisons, *et al*). Corollary wey dey for this argument na say the less retribution wey this people go dey fear, the more evil dem go dey do.

However, the government *demself* nor dey under any force or retribution, but na law for even imself. Even for Western democracies, how many policemen and politicians dey go jail?

Therefore if evil people dey wish to do harm, but na only force dey fit dey hold them, then society *nor go ever* permit make government exist because evil people go work well well to grab control of that government, make them for do evil and come avoid retribution. For society wey get pure evil, then the only hope for stability go come be the state of nature, where arming wey dey general and fear for retribution go come reduce the evil intentions wey all these disparate groups get. As the case wey concern nuclear-armed nations, a “balance of power” go dey bring peace.

The third possibility na say *most*people dey evil, na only small good. If that one na the case, then the government nor go fit dey permitted to exist, since the majority of people wey dey control the government go come be evil people, and go come rule despotically over the minority wey dey good. Democracy in particular nor go dey permitted, since the minority of people wey dey good go dey under the democratic control of the plenty people wey dey evil. Evil people, wey dey wish to harm people wey nor dey fear retribution, go control the government inevitably, and use their power to tey do evil and nor go fear the consequences.

Good people nor dey act morally because of say them dey fear retribution, but because dem love virtue and peace of mind – and therefore, unlike evil people, them go only gain little if dem get control of the government. For this scenario, then, the government go inevitably dey controlled by the evil people wey plenty pass wey go rule over everybody, to the detriment of people wey dey moral.

The fourth option na say most people dey good, and only few dey evil. This possibility dey under the same problems wey dem list for up, notably say evil people go wan always gain control over government, make dem for cover themselves from retaliation wey dey just, because of their crimes. This option dey only change the *appearance* of democracy: because the majority of people dey good, power-seekers wey dey evil must lie give them make them for get power, and then, after them don enter public office, them go immediately break the faith and begin dey pursue their own agendas wey dey corrupt, come dey enforce their own will through police and military.[^7] Therefore the government go remain the greatest prize to most of the men wey dey evil. Wey go quickly gain control over the power wey dey good - to the detriment of all the souls wey dey good – and so them nor suppose allow the government to exist for this scenario too.


E don dey clear say e nor get situation wey government go fit logically or morally allow make e exist. De only justification wey dey possible make government for tey exist na say if the majority of men go com dey evil, but all the power wey dey government go com dey controlled by de minority of men wey dey good.[^8]

Dis kind situation, as e dey interesting theoretically go com break down logically because:

1. De majority wey dey evil go quickly vote comot de minority or dem go use coup tey overthrow them;
2. E no get way to tey make sure say na only good people go always dey run government; and,
3. E nor get any example say this kind thing don occur for any record of state history wey dey brutal.

De error wey dey logical wey dem make to dey always defend government na to imagine say any moral judgement wey dey collective wey dem apply to any group of people na *dem nor apply am for group wey dey rule over them*. If fifty percent of people dey evil, den *at least* fifty percent of people wey dey rule over dem go also dey evil.[^9] So, to tey talk say evil dey exist nor go fit justify de reason say na because of am government com dey exist.

If evil nor dey, governments nor go dey necessary. If evil dey exist, de government go dey very dangerous if dem allow am make e exist.

Why this mistake dey occur well well?

E get some of de reasons, wey dem go fit only touch for dis place. De first one na say government dey introduce imself give children as teachers wey dey teach for public schools wey dem consider as people wey get power and wey com still dey moral. Therefore *morality* plus *authority* dey associated with government – one kind association first wey go don get power well well after many years of repetition wey don already dey inside their body.

De second one be say government nor dey ever teach children about the root of their own power – wey be violence – instead, im go dey pretend say e be another institution wey dey social, like one kind business or church or even charity sef, but im dey more moral.

De third one na de prevalence of religion and propaganda wey dey always tie men to de evil wey dey government – dat na why rulers dey always dey interested to push the interest wey concern churches and state “education”. For de world-view wey dey religious, absolute power resemble virtue wey dey perfect, for form wey resemble deity. For de real political world wey concern men, however, for power to increase mean say evil go increase. With religion too, all wetin go happen go be for good – therefore, to dey fight power wey don already dey encroach be like to dey fight de will of dat deity. E get many more reasons, of course, but dese ones dey among de ones wey deep pass.[^10]

For de beginning of this section, I talk say people dey generally dey make *two* type of mistake wen dem confront dem with de idea to remove government. De first one na de belief say government dey necessary because evil people dey exist. De second one na de belief say if government nor dey, any social institution wey rise go inevitably take over the place wey government dey occupy. Therefore, Dispute Resolution Organisations (DROs), insurance companies and security forces wey dey private, all of dem dey considered as potential cancers wey go swell and go take over de polity.

Dis view dey rise from de same error wey we talk for up. If *all*institutions wey dey social dey constantly dey try to increase their power and carry out the will wey concern them on top other people, den with dat particular argument, government wey dey centralized, dem nor fit allow am make im exist. If na iron law wey groups dey always try to claim power over other groups and individuals, den dat power-lust *nor go end if na one of dem win, but e go dey continue to spread pass through society and nobody go fit stop am until to dey make people slave go come be normal thing*.

De only way wey social institutions go fit grow into monopolies wey dey violent na *to offload de cost wey enforcement of dere victims go bring*.  Governments dey grow without end because say dem dey pay tax collectors with one portion of the tax wey dem dey collect. De slaves go come dey forced to pay for the cost of the one wey dem tey dey enslave them.

For society wey dey voluntary, taxation nor go dey, and therefore any group wey dey wish to gain power wey go be monopolistic go need to fund im own army by imsef, and dat one nor go dey feasible or go dey profitable economically.[^11]

E dey very hard to understand de intelligence and logic wey dey de argument say, for us to tey protect ourself from group wey *go fit*overpower us, we go support de group wey *don already* overpower us. E dey similar to de statist argument wey concern monopolies wey dey private – say citizens go create monopoly government because say dem dey afraid of monopolies wey dey private. E nor dey take vision wey dey keen to see pass all those nonsense.

Wetin be de evidence for de matter wey talk say powers wey dey decentralized and wey dey compete dey promote peace? In another word, e get any fact wey we go fit draw to support the idea say if we balance power na the only chance wey individual get to take get freedom?

Crimes wey dey organized nor dey provide many examples wey dey good, since gangs wey dey corrupt go regularly manipulate and use de power of government police to tey enforce their own rules, and so, all dose gang, we nor fit talk say dem dey operate for de state of nature. Also, criminal gangs dey profit well well if dem dey supply substances or sevices wey dem don ban legally, and so dem dey grow well well due to policies wey dey the state.

One example wey go dey more useful na the fact say e nor get any leader wey don ever declare war for another leader wey still get nuclear weapons. For de past, when leaders dey feel say dem dey immune from retaliation wey dey personal, dem dey more willing to even kill their own people if dem wage war. Now wey dem don dey under annihilation, na only countries wey nor fit fight back dem dey dey willing to attack.

Dis na lesson wey dey instructive as to why those men dey require populations wey dey dependent and wey nor carry arm – and one good example of how to dey fear reprisal dey inherent for system wey don dey balanced, wey dey decentralized and wey get powers wey dey compete *na de only method wey dem fit prove to take secure and maintain liberty wey dey personal*.

To dey run from devils wey we dey inside our mind and run enter protective prisons wey government do  to tey ensure say de destruction of de particular liberty wey dey make life dey worth living.
