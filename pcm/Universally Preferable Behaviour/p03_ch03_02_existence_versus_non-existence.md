E don dey clear say e nor get situation wey government go fit logically or morally allow make e exist. De only justification wey dey possible make government for tey exist na say if the majority of men go com dey evil, but all the power wey dey government go com dey controlled by de minority of men wey dey good.[^8]

Dis kind situation, as e dey interesting theoretically go com break down logically because:

1. De majority wey dey evil go quickly vote comot de minority or dem go use coup tey overthrow them;
2. E no get way to tey make sure say na only good people go always dey run government; and,
3. E nor get any example say this kind thing don occur for any record of state history wey dey brutal.

De error wey dey logical wey dem make to dey always defend government na to imagine say any moral judgement wey dey collective wey dem apply to any group of people na *dem nor apply am for group wey dey rule over them*. If fifty percent of people dey evil, den *at least* fifty percent of people wey dey rule over dem go also dey evil.[^9] So, to tey talk say evil dey exist nor go fit justify de reason say na because of am government com dey exist.

If evil nor dey, governments nor go dey necessary. If evil dey exist, de government go dey very dangerous if dem allow am make e exist.

Why this mistake dey occur well well?

E get some of de reasons, wey dem go fit only touch for dis place. De first one na say government dey introduce imself give children as teachers wey dey teach for public schools wey dem consider as people wey get power and wey com still dey moral. Therefore *morality* plus *authority* dey associated with government – one kind association first wey go don get power well well after many years of repetition wey don already dey inside their body.

De second one be say government nor dey ever teach children about the root of their own power – wey be violence – instead, im go dey pretend say e be another institution wey dey social, like one kind business or church or even charity sef, but im dey more moral.

De third one na de prevalence of religion and propaganda wey dey always tie men to de evil wey dey government – dat na why rulers dey always dey interested to push the interest wey concern churches and state “education.” For de world-view wey dey religious, absolute power resemble virtue wey dey perfect, for form wey resemble deity. For de real political world wey concern men, however, for power to increase mean say evil go increase. With religion too, all wetin go happen go be for good – therefore, to dey fight power wey don already dey encroach be like to dey fight de will of dat deity. E get many more reasons, of course, but dese ones dey among de ones wey deep pass.[^10]

For de beginning of this section, I talk say people dey generally dey make *two* type of mistake wen dem confront dem with de idea to remove government. De first one na de belief say government dey necessary because evil people dey exist. De second one na de belief say if government nor dey, any social institution wey rise go inevitably take over the place wey government dey occupy. Therefore, Dispute Resolution Organisations (DROs), insurance companies and security forces wey dey private, all of dem dey considered as potential cancers wey go swell and go take over de polity.

Dis view dey rise from de same error wey we talk for up. If *all*institutions wey dey social dey constantly dey try to increase their power and carry out the will wey concern them on top other people, den with dat particular argument, government wey dey centralized, dem nor fit allow am make im exist. If na iron law wey groups dey always try to claim power over other groups and individuals, den dat power-lust *nor go end if na one of dem win, but e go dey continue to spread pass through society and nobody go fit stop am until to dey make people slave go come be normal thing*.

De only way wey social institutions go fit grow into monopolies wey dey violent na *to offload de cost wey enforcement of dere victims go bring*.  Governments dey grow without end because say dem dey pay tax collectors with one portion of the tax wey dem dey collect. De slaves go come dey forced to pay for the cost of the one wey dem tey dey enslave them.

For society wey dey voluntary, taxation nor go dey, and therefore any group wey dey wish to gain power wey go be monopolistic go need to fund im own army by imsef, and dat one nor go dey feasible or go dey profitable economically.[^11]

E dey very hard to understand de intelligence and logic wey dey de argument say, for us to tey protect ourself from group wey *go fit*overpower us, we go support de group wey *don already* overpower us. E dey similar to de statist argument wey concern monopolies wey dey private – say citizens go create monopoly government because say dem dey afraid of monopolies wey dey private. E nor dey take vision wey dey keen to see pass all those nonsense.

Wetin be de evidence for de matter wey talk say powers wey dey decentralized and wey dey compete dey promote peace? In another word, e get any fact wey we go fit draw to support the idea say if we balance power na the only chance wey individual get to take get freedom?

Crimes wey dey organized nor dey provide many examples wey dey good, since gangs wey dey corrupt go regularly manipulate and use de power of government police to tey enforce their own rules, and so, all dose gang, we nor fit talk say dem dey operate for de state of nature. Also, criminal gangs dey profit well well if dem dey supply substances or sevices wey dem don ban legally, and so dem dey grow well well due to policies wey dey the state.

One example wey go dey more useful na the fact say e nor get any leader wey don ever declare war for another leader wey still get nuclear weapons. For de past, when leaders dey feel say dem dey immune from retaliation wey dey personal, dem dey more willing to even kill their own people if dem wage war. Now wey dem don dey under annihilation, na only countries wey nor fit fight back dem dey dey willing to attack.

Dis na lesson wey dey instructive as to why those men dey require populations wey dey dependent and wey nor carry arm – and one good example of how to dey fear reprisal dey inherent for system wey don dey balanced, wey dey decentralized and wey get powers wey dey compete *na de only method wey dem fit prove to take secure and maintain liberty wey dey personal*.

To dey run from devils wey we dey inside our mind and run enter protective prisons wey government do  to tey ensure say de destruction of de particular liberty wey dey make life dey worth living.
