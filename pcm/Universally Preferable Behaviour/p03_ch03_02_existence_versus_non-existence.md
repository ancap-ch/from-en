E dey clear then say e nor get situation wey government go fit logically or morally dey allowed to exist. The only justification wey dey possible make government for tey exist na say if the majority of men dey evil, but all the power wey dey government dey controlled by minority of men wey dey good.[^8]

This kind situation, as e dey interesting theoretically go break down logically because:

1. The majority wey dey evil go quickly vote comot the minority or use coup take overpower them;
2. E no get way to take ensure say na only good people go always dey run government; and,
3. E nor get any example say this kind thing don occur for any annals of state history wey dey brutal.

The error wey dey logical wey dem make to dey always defend government na to imagine say any moral judgement wey dey collective wey dem apply to any group of people na *dem nor apply am for group wey dey rule over them*. If fifty percent of people dey evil, then *at least* fifty percent of people wey dey rule over them also dey evil.[^9] Therefore, to talk say evil dey exist nor go fit justify the reason say na cause of am government dey exist.

If evil nor dey, governments nor dey necessary. If evil dey exist, the government go dey very dangerous if dem allow am to exist.

Why this error dey so prevalent?

E get number of reasons, wey dem go fit only touch for here. The first one na say government dey introduce imself give children as teachers wey dey teach for public schools wey dem consider as authorities wey dey moral. Therefore *morality* and *authority* dey associated with government – one kind association first wey dey reinforce after many years of repetition wey dey grinding.

The second one be say government nor dey ever teach children about the root of their own power – wey be violence – instead, im go dey pretend say e be another institution wey dey social, like one business or church or even charity, but im dey more moral.

The third one na the prevalence of religion and propaganda wey dey always tie men to the evil wey dey government – that na why rulers dey always dey interested to push the interest wey concern churches and state “education.” For the world-view wey dey religious, absolute power resemble virtue wey dey perfect, for form wey resemble deity. For the real political world wey concern men, however, for power to increase mean say evil go increase. With religion too, all wetin go happen go be for good – therefore, to dey fight power wey don already dey encroach be like to dey fight the will of that deity. E get many more reasons, of course, but these ones dey among the ones wey deep pass.[^10]

For the beginning of this section, I talk say people dey generally dey make *two* type of mistake when them confront them with the idea to dissolve government. The first one na the belief say government dey necessary because evil people dey exist. The second one na the belief say if government nor dey, any social institution wey rise go inevitably take over the place wey government dey occupy. Therefore, Dispute Resolution Organisations (DROs), insurance companies and security forces wey dey private, all of them dey considered as potential cancers wey go swell and go take over the polity.

This view dey rise from the same error wey we talk for up. If *all*institutions wey dey social dey constantly dey try to increase their power and enforce will wey concern them on top other people, then with that particular argument, government wey dey centralized, them nor fit allow am make im exist. If na iron law wey groups dey always try to claim power over other groups and individuals, then that power-lust *nor go end if na one of them win, but e go dey continue to spread pass through society and nobody go fit oppose am until to dey make people slave go come be normal thing*.

The only way wey social institutions go fit grow into monopolies wey dey violent na *to offload the cost wey enforcement of their victims go bring*.  Governments dey grow without end because say them dey pay tax collectors with one portion of the tax wey dem dey collect. The slaves go come dey forced to pay for the cost of the one wey dem take enslave them.

For society wey dey voluntary, taxation nor go dey, and therefore any group wey dey wish to gain power wey go be monopolistic go need to fund im own army by imself, and that one no go dey feasible or go dey profitable economically.[^11]

E dey very hard to understand the intelligence and logic wey dey the argument say, for us to take protect us from group we *go fit*overpower us, we go support the group wey *don already* overpower us. E dey similar to the statist argument wey concern monopolies wey dey private – say citizens go create monopoly government because say dem dey afraid of monopolies wey dey private. E nor dey take vision wey dey keen to see pass all those nonsense.

Wetin be the evidence for the matter wey talk say powers wey dey decentralized and wey dey compete dey promote peace? In another word, e get any fact wey we go fit draw to support the idea say if we balance power na the only chance wey individual get to take get freedom?

Crimes wey dey organized nor dey provide many examples wey dey good, since gangs wey dey corrupt go regularly manipulate and use the power of government police to take enforce their own rules, and so, all those gang, we nor fit talk say dem dey operate for the state of nature. Also, criminal gangs dey profit well well if dem dey supply substances or sevices wey dem don ban legally, and so dem dey grow well well due to policies wey dey the state.

An example wey dey more useful na the fact say e nor get any leader wey don ever declare war for another leader wey still get nuclear weapons. For the past, when leaders dey feel say dem dey immune from retaliation wey dey personal, dem dey more willing to even kill their own populations if dem wage war. Now wey dem don dey under annihilation, na only countries wey nor fit fight back dem dey dey willing to attack.

This na lesson wey dey instructive as to why those men dey require populations wey dey dependent and wey nor carry arm – and one good example of how to dey fear reprisal dey inherent for balanced system wey dey decentralized and wey powers dey compete *na the only method wey dem fit prove to take secure and maintain liberty wey dey personal*.

To dey run from devils wey we dey imagine inside protective prisons wey government provide na to ensure say the destruction of the particular liberty wey dey make life dey worth living.
