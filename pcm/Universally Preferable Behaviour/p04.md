# Conclusions

Inside time wey no tay, we don cover many many areas. But our biggest wahala na how to take define the universal, objective and all the morality wey no concern God or the state sef. Because if we carry God put inside the way wey we tay define morality ehn, morality no go come be universal, objective or absolute again. If we wan talk am in another way, morality no go come be morality again.

If them bring people like God and the state enter this matter, e no go answer all the questions wey e be say people dey ask about morality.

We understand everything say as we carry God enter, e no do anything and e no answer some of the question about how life take start or even the universe sef.  If we wan talk am sef ehn, the answer to any question be say, “some beings (people) wey we no even understand, them do some kind things wey we no fit imagine sef, in a way wey go hard us to explain and the reason why dem even do am sef, we nor even know” this kind definition, we no go fit accept am as answer wey normal and wey go satisfy everybody.

The biggest wahala wey dey wen we wan make answers wey  dey hard to understand on top question wey really dey very important be say, e go provide answer wey we fit imagine oo, but the answer wey e go provide, e dey very far from the correct thing. If we an still talk am well well, e get some people wey gather to defend and to gain something from this kind of answer wey no correct. For inside religion, all this kind people belong to the priestly circle. And for government, all this people belong to the political circle.

If question wey dey very very important come meet with answer wey get spiritual background, or background wey dem dey use force, the kind growth wey we human beings dey grow go come dey go back back. That science wey dey study weather go come fail if some kind priests talk say rain dey only fall cause of say na because God want am like that. Even the science wey concern medicine too go come fail if some people talk say why people dey sick na because of say the gods dey punish dem. The science wey concern physics too go come stop, then e go come dey go back back if them agree say the movement wey stars dey move na because of say dem be the clock wey all this deities them dey use.

When all this kind answers wey no correct na the kind answers wey them dey give to all this very important questions, to dey question those kind answers no go ever stop and  e go be very bad thing morally. When things wey we imagine come be the answers to all those questions wey dey make our mind no dey rest, all those people wey dey gain from all this kind imaginations go always dey fight to dey defend all those things wey dem think say na him be the truth.

And till this world go end, na children go always be the first people wey them dey teach all this kind things wey no be true.

Dem no need to force small children to chop candy, play with tag or tell dem say two plus two na four. The kind of mind wey human being get no need make u force truth enter am by force or say person dey bored or through insult or say you dey repeat one thing over and over. Small pikin no need make you teach am say all this toy dey real or say you dey tell the pikin say e don condemn go hell forever because of say e no believe say that toy dey real. You no need force small pikin to believe say chocolate dey sweet by only mouth because say e taste bud don condemn because of sin.

If we talk say dey morality exist because of say na God tell us na the same thing if we talk say morality no even dey sef. If you buy iPod from my hand for eBay, and I come send you box wey nothing dey inside, you go write back to me with vex. If I come tell you say make you nor worry because of say that my friend wey we no dey see tell me say make I no doubt, say IPod dey inside, fear go still dey catch you? Shey dat my claim say na that my friend wey we no dey see tell me say ipod dey inside, shey that kind claim go even be proof say the ipod no even exist at all at all sef?

If them accept morality based on somebody wey no even exist, then make we no even accept that definition of morality sef. If I write cheque wey the bank say no exist, dat one go come mean say that cheque no be better cheque.

Na the same thing if we wan carry out morality because of one state wey no even correct. If we accept the government wey dey – a small group of people wey get right to bring the use of force, right wey e be say nobody again get – then any al all the moral rules wey all this people bring na nothing but subjective, since this government according to definition dey even disregard moral rules sef.

If I talk say I need the government make them hhelp me protect my property, the na the same government be the same group of people wey no de obey my own property rights at will, then I dey inside contradiction wey I no fit come out from. I dey talk say my property right must be defended, and hen I come create one agency to help me defend them wey go fit violate them at any time. This one be like I dey fear sotay I come hire bodyguard to come protect me make them for no rape me, but inside the contact, I allow my body guard and anyone wey the bodyguard choose to rape me as e like.

Because any form of morality wey we carry give government or carry give religion no go ever dey rational and e go dey contradict itself, e go need a social agency wey get monopoly on the initiation of force make e act. Since everone dey make up morals,and come dey claim justification on top people wey we no dey see, negotiation wey dey rational, and understanding no dey ever dey possible. We no need government because say people bad, but instead because say people nor dey rational, we come end up with government. Noral theories wey no be true dey always end up for where only violence go come be the answer last last. Dem no dey develop moral theories because dem wan react to violence, na because of lie lie moral theories violence take dey happen. In fact na those kind theories dey call violence sef.
 
The doctrine wey e be say na mind go come dey create reality and wetin no dey rational as means wey we tay dey answer “wetin be truth” with “God” and “wetin be morality?” with “government,” e dey very open by the framework of UPB wey dey hard to imagine say this concepts no spread well well.

One main reason for this thing na because for you to really understand UPB, you go need the highest brain work. E no hard like that for person to dey rational, e dey hard to even think without doubt the whole form of rationalityand everything wey dey inside. E dey very easy o dey argue, e dey very hard to remove all the assumptions wey go cause doubt wey dey involved for every form of argument.

E dey easy to catch one ball. But e dey hard to make physics wey go explain motion in every way.

To dey think about wetin you dey think na the hardest thing wey your brain go fit do.

For the beginning of this book, I talk about one “beast” wey dey fear mankind and wey make dem to be slave. The beast dey always stay on top mountain or inside one cave wey deep. People wey dey this world dey fear this beast and na why dem never fit defeat this beast.

Them never ever defeat this beast because this beast no really exist.

For this world, them nor fit defeat that beast cause na we be the beast.

The fantasy wey all of us get say e get one “null zone” wey dey exist for where morality go dey reverse itself like say na magic is called “the government” na the same as the fantasy wey all of us still get wey e be say we dey think say e still get “null zone” wey dem dey call “God” for where ”reality” for dey reverse itself.

If we dey define “morality” according to subjectivees things wey mere mortals dey imagine, the forever the thing go still remain under the kind control of those tyrants wey dey power hungry. Since god no dey exist, anybody wey speak anything wey concern morality wey still concern God just dey make up definitions wey go serve e own purpose.

Since “the state” no dey exist, anybody wey dey talk about morality wey get to do with government just dey make up definitions wey go serve e own purpose.

Until we fit define morality wey be say dey objective and wey dey rational and wey dey free from subjective whims of every person, we no go make the kind progress wey we need to make as a species.

Morality, like physics, biology, geology and chemistry, must follow for the realm of sciences if we go ever flourish – and really to survive at all.

However, if we fit sustain our courage, na this kind discipline go fit set us and our children and all humanity for future wey free from tyranny of that beast wey bad pass wey be our own moral illusion.
