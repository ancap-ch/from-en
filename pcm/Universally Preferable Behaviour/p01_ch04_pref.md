## Preferences

Now wey we don understand how arguments wey dey make us loose be,  we go fit turn to d question of how  we dey prefer.                                                                                            

Preferences, wey be how we dey prefer, dey d centre of any methodology, wey be how things dey run, dey claim say e dey talk true – value of d words wey dem dey yan. The science method, for instance, na wetin dem know say how e dey prefer for reasons wey dey consistent and wetin based on observation or experience, na wetin dem born am with am.

For dis sense, “preferable” nor mean “e kind of better” but wetin dey “required”. If you wan live, e dey preferred everywhere for d world say make you comot yourself  say you wan eat arsenic. If you wish to know real truth about reality, e dey preferred everywhere for d world say your theories wey you get go dey consistent for inside  and dem go fit verify d experience wey fit follow am. “Wetin dem prefer d world” kon  translate to “wetin nor too dey required”, but we go keep d word “preferable” take differentiate between those optional things for human being nor get perfection and  those physical things wey nor get perfection and e nor dey optional like gravity.

As e dey similar, if theories of correct good behaviuor go be true, then dem go must at least dey consistent for inside and outside. For other word, theory wey be good correct behaviour wey nor clear and e dey against eself nor go fit be true – and theory of good correct behaviour wey nor clear and e dey against eself and e near wetin dem prefer everywhere for d world nor go fit be true.

So, for correct good behaviour, just as e dey for science, mathematics, engineering and all other disciplines wey dey compare theories to reality, theories wey hold true go must dey consistent and dem go fit verify am with experience.

### Preferences And Existence

If I say “I like ice cream”, na only one word get different meaning for that sentence. As e clear, “I” dey exist, since I dey express wetin I prefer personally. As e take clear, “ice cream” also dey exist for reality. Anyhow as e be, d word “like” dey give many problems.

How we dey prefer no dey exist for reality as we take wan get am. If you dey very curious, you go follow me normal around and record every time I eat ice cream, and e go fit give good basis for  experience to take establish wetin I prefer. E dey possible say e fit exist, anyhow as e be, say na fact say I be masochist, and kon dislike ice cream well well, kon prefer to suffer myself with taste wey nor good – and I kon confuse you by to dey claim say I  like am.

We go fit find evidence for wetin we prefer; we nor go fit find prefer itself for reality. Wetin we prefer dey exist as a relationship between consciousness and matter, just as gravity dey exist as a relationship between body of mass.

Make we put for one side d question wey dey challenge us about freewill versus determinism, e dey reasonable to assume say whatever person dey do for present na wetin he or she “prefer” to do. If I get up  go work , then as e be, I prefer to do am, as e dey oppose all  alternatives wey dey. Even if I hate my job, I hate am clear less than say I nor get one penny.

As we get am say human being fit perform plenty actions wey nor get end, whatever one person dey do for that moment na wetin dem don already choose out of all others options wey dey possible. I dey choose to write this book than, say I dey learn how to tango.

When we put this simple fact for correct good arguments, we go come with better results wey dey very interesting.

### Wetin we prefer and Arguments

As we dey remember d analysis wey  we don do before about arguments wey dey make us loose, we go fit easily understand the kind back and front way wey d statement be: “wetin we prefer nor dey exist”. As we get am say every action wey human being dey do – including statements wey dey philosophical – na wetin dey chosen to prefer to any other actions wey dey possible, to dey argue say wetin we prefer nor dey exist need “how we prefer am” to take argue say wetin we prefer nor dey exist, for which d statement  dey contradict itself. To dey argue say wetin we prefer nor dey exist na exactly d same as to dey argue say language nor dey exist. Na argument wey go totally dey win us.

Since e dey impossible to act without I nor express wetin I prefer – either closely or openly – anyone who dey act accept d premise say wetin dey preferred dey exist. So, e dey impossible to argue say d existence of wetin dem prefer without you nor   accept say wetin dem prefer dey exist.

### Wetin we prefer And Everywhere for d world

D next question go kon tin be: wetin we prefer na our own personal opinion, or na wetin dey everywhere for d world?

As e clear, some things wey we prefer na our personal opinion. D way we like music, our personal hobby, d favourite books wey we dey read and so on na wetin we personally prefer.
D challenge go arise when we try to define some things wey we prefer wey be our goal to get.

D word wey we dey try relate na: some ofd things wey we prefer fit be wetin we dey pursue to get, that is, everywhere for d world?

When I say some of wetin we prefer fit be wetin we dey pursue, I nor mean say na everybody dey follow dis same thing all time. If I wan argue say breathing na wetin dem prefer to pursue, examples of those wey don hang themselves commit suicide  go counter wetin I talk. If I wan argue say to dey eat na wetin dem dey prefer to pursue, examples of those wey dey hunger strike and those wey get problem of wetin to eat go counter wetin I talk. 

So,when I talk about wetin dem prefer everywhere for d world, I dey talk about wetin people go prefer, not wetin dem dey always prefer. To use one science analogy, to take truly understand d universe, make people use science method – dis one nor mean say dem dey always do so, since as e clear say billions of people dey consult olden days tori than scince wey dey today for “answers”. E nor get any other way to get truth about d universe without science, but people dey free to change “truth” as “mistake”, and relax their mind with nonsense wey dey physical.

As e be, if one man wan cure infection, make he take antibiotics than to go perform Aztec rain dance. To prefer to take antibiotics than to do the rain dance na wetin dey everywhere for d world, since to dey dance nor go fit cure infections. Now, although say one madman dey wey fit cure infection imself by to dey dance , e still dey preferred everywhere for d world say if d man wan cure infection, he must take antibiotics.

For another word, if you fit get to d top of one mountain, if you dey wish for it, e nor go work. If you wan know d origin of d universe, prayer nor go fit provide answer for you. People still dey wish, and pray, but that one nor make wishing and praying dey more effective. With that one for mind, make we turn to d question of whether or not wetin dey preferred everywhere for d world fit be true.

### Arguments And Everywhere for the world

If I choose to argue, I don accept many different premise wey worth my time to stop here.

#### Premise 1: Two of us dey exist

If I choose to argue with you, then I nor need to accept say two of us dey exist. If I believe say I dey exist, but you nor believe, then to dey argue  nor go make sense, and e go be d action of madman. If I dey argue with myself for mirror, make dem sedate me and not to dey argue with me.

#### Premise 2: D Sense get d capacity to dey correct

Since human beings nor go fit use psychic way take communicate, all d arguments involve d use of our sense. Writing go suppose come before sight; to talk require to dey hear; Braille go require touch. Any relation wey depend on say d senses nor dey true dey automatically destroy same person.

#### Premise 3: Language Get D Capacity To Mean Something 

Like as Premise Two be, since all d arguments need language, any relation wey rest for d premise say language dey meaningless go dey disapproved immediately. To use language take dey argue say language nor get meaning be like say you dey use courier take dey send message and you dey argue say courier nor dey deliver message.

#### Premise 4: Correction Require Wetin Dem Prefer Everywhere For The World

If you correct me for one mistake wey I make, you dey closely accept d fact say e go dey better for me to correct my own mistake. Wetin you prefer for me to correct my mistake nor be personal felling, but open to catch and for everywhere.

You  nor go say to me: “Make you change your opinion to my own because I go prefer am”, but rather: “Make you correct your opinion because e dey purposely incorrect”. My mistake nor arise from say I nor agree with you, but e come a result of my dodge from one purpose standard of truth. Your argument say make I correct my false opinion relax on value of truth wey dey to accomplish – that is, truth dey preferable everywhere for d world to error, and truth na wetin dem wan accomplish everywhere for d world.

#### Premise 5: Objective Methodology Dey Exist To Separate Truth From Falsehood

If you disagree with me, but I tell you say you must agree with me because I dey always dey right, e dey unlikely say you go dey satisfied by d  way my argument take dey careful. If you provide good reason as to why I dey wrong, but I just keep to dey repeat say I dey right because I always dey right, our interaction go scarce to put for category as a debate.

D moment wey I provide some kind of things wey I go used take determine truth from falsehood, I dey accept say truth dey more than opinion matter.

Dis one nor mean say things wey I dey try accomplish dey logical – I fit refer you to one religious text, for example. Anyhow as e be, even if I do so, I still dey accept say d truth na something wey dey required and e d ey independent of positive statement of wetin person talk take support – say one purpose methodology dey exist take dey separate truth from falsehood. 

#### Premise 6: Truth Better Pass Falsehood

If I tell you say d world dey flat, and you reply say d world nor dey flat, but round, then, you dey closely dey accept d fact say truth and falsehood dey exist to accomplish d same thing, and say truth better pass falsehood.

If I tell you say I like chocolate ice cream, and you tell me say you like vanilla, e dey impossible to “prove” say vanilla dey purposely better pass chocolate. D  moment wey you correct me with reference to facts, you dey accept say open facts dey exist, and say open truth dey preferable everywhere for d world to error wey dey submissive. 

#### Premise 7: Peaceful Argument Na D Best Way To Resolve Dispute

If I tell you say d world dey flat, and you kon pull your gun come out and shoot me, dis one go rarely be  one example of argument wey dey productive. True true, our disagreement for don “resolve” – but because only one us dem leave dey stand for there at the end.

If you first  tell me before say you go deal with any disagreement by to shoot me, I go unlikely engage for argument with you. So, e clear say any argument go rely on d premise wey nor too show say evidence, reason, truth and objectivity be d “wetin dey preferred everywhere for d world” method wey dem take dey resolve quarrel between people. E go dey completely senseless to argue say differences of opinion go dey resolved by to dey use violence – d only consistent argument for d value of violence na d use of violence.[^4]

As e real, then, argument go require one d methodology of one purpose, through language wey dey meaningful, for d truth wey dey everywhere for d world wey dem dey chase, and e kon be wetin dey purposely preferred to person mistake.

Dis wetin dey preferred for truth wey dey everywhere for d world nor be wetin dey preferred for degree, but for kind. One shortcut wey dey reduce your driving time by half na twice e good for route wey dey longer – but of dem dey preferable to dey drive for complete wrong direction.

For d same way, d truth nor just “better” pass mistake – e dey preferable or na wetin dem require.

#### Premise 8: Na People Dey Responsible For Their Actions

If I argue say human beings nor dey responsible for their actions, I dey catch up for wetin I nor fit understand, e kon be d question of whether or not I dey responsible for my argument, and also whether or not you dey responsible for your response.

If my argument say human beings nor dey responsible for their action na true, then I nor dey responsible for my argument, and you nor dey responsible for your reply. Anyhow as e be, if I believe say you nor dey responsible for your reply, e go take small sense wey dey precious take make d argument go advance – e go be exactly d same as to dey argue with television set.[^5]

So, for d basis, if I tell you say you nor dey responsible for your actions, I dey tell you say e dey preferred everywhere for d world for you to believe say wetin dey preferred dey impossible, since if you nor get control over your actions, you nor go fit choose state to dey preferred, that is, truth over falsehood. So dis argument, like d argument before, dey destroy person.

[^4]: E go dey useful to dey keep dis particular premise for mind, since e go dey very important later on.

[^5]: D question of responsibility na, of course, dey very related to d question of free will versus determinism, and e go be d subject of another book.
