## Preferences

Now wey we don understand how arguments wey dey make us loose be,  we go fit turn to d question of how  we dey prefer.                                                                                            

Preferences, wey be how we dey prefer, dey d centre of any methodology, wey be how things dey run, dey claim say e dey talk true – value of d words wey dem dey yan. The science method, for instance, na wetin dem know say how e dey prefer for reasons wey dey consistent and wetin based on observation or experience, na wetin dem born am with am.

For dis sense, “preferable” nor mean “e kind of better” but wetin dey “required.” If you wan live, e dey preferred everywhere for d world say make you comot yourself  say you wan eat arsenic. If you wish to know real truth about reality, e dey preferred everywhere for d world say your theories wey you get go dey consistent for inside  and dem go fit verify d experience wey fit follow am. “Wetin dem prefer d world” kon  translate to “wetin nor too dey required,” but we go keep d word “preferable” take differentiate between those optional things for human being nor get perfection and  those physical things wey nor get perfection and e nor dey optional like gravity.

As e dey similar, if theories of correct good behaviuor go be true, then dem go must at least dey consistent for inside and outside. For other word, theory wey be good correct behaviour wey nor clear and e dey against eself nor go fit be true – and theory of good correct behaviour wey nor clear and e dey against eself and e near wetin dem prefer everywhere for d world nor go fit be true.

So, for correct good behaviour, just as e dey for science, mathematics, engineering and all other disciplines wey dey compare theories to reality, theories wey hold true go must dey consistent and dem go fit verify am with experience.

### Preferences And Existence

If I say “I like ice cream,” na only one word get different meaning for that sentence. As e clear, “I” dey exist, since I dey express wetin I prefer personally. As e take clear, “ice cream” also dey exist for reality. Anyhow as e be, d word “like” dey give many problems.

How we dey prefer no dey exist for reality as we take wan get am. If you dey very curious, you go follow me normal around and record every time I eat ice cream, and e go fit give good basis for  experience to take establish wetin I prefer. E dey possible say e fit exist, anyhow as e be, say na fact say I be masochist, and kon dislike ice cream well well, kon prefer to suffer myself with taste wey nor good – and I kon confuse you by to dey claim say I  like am.

We go fit find evidence for wetin we prefer; we nor go fit find prefer itself for reality. Wetin we prefer dey exist as a relationship between consciousness and matter, just as gravity dey exist as a relationship between body of mass.

Make we put for one side d question wey dey challenge us about freewill versus determinism, e dey reasonable to assume say whatever person dey do for present na wetin he or she “prefer” to do. If I get up  go work , then as e be, I prefer to do am, as e dey oppose all  alternatives wey dey. Even if I hate my job, I hate am clear less than say I nor get one penny.

As we get am say human being fit perform plenty actions wey nor get end, whatever one person dey do for that moment na wetin dem don already choose out of all others options wey dey possible. I dey choose to write this book than, say I dey learn how to tango.

When we put this simple fact for correct good arguments, we go come with better results wey dey very interesting.

### Wetin we prefer and Arguments

As we dey remember d analysis wey  we don do before about arguments wey dey make us loose, we go fit easily understand the kind back and front way wey d statement be: “wetin we prefer nor dey exist.” As we get am say every action wey human being dey do – including statements wey dey philosophical – na wetin dey chosen to prefer to any other actions wey dey possible, to dey argue say wetin we prefer nor dey exist need “how we prefer am” to take argue say wetin we prefer nor dey exist, for which d statement  dey contradict itself. To dey argue say wetin we prefer nor dey exist na exactly d same as to dey argue say language nor dey exist. Na argument wey go totally dey win us.

Since e dey impossible to act without I nor express wetin I prefer – either closely or openly – anyone who dey act accept d premise say wetin dey preferred dey exist. So, e dey impossible to argue say d existence of wetin dem prefer without you nor   accept say wetin dem prefer dey exist.

### Wetin we prefer And Everywhere for d world

D next question go kon tin be: wetin we prefer na our own personal opinion, or na wetin dey everywhere for d world?

As e clear, some things wey we prefer na our personal opinion. D way we like music, our personal hobby, d favourite books wey we dey read and so on na wetin we personally prefer.
D challenge go arise when we try to define some things wey we prefer wey be our goal to get.

D word wey we dey try relate na: some ofd things wey we prefer fit be wetin we dey pursue to get, that is, everywhere for d world?

When I say some of wetin we prefer fit be wetin we dey pursue, I nor mean say na everybody dey follow dis same thing all time. If I wan argue say breathing na wetin dem prefer to pursue, examples of those wey don hang themselves commit suicide  go counter wetin I talk. If I wan argue say to dey eat na wetin dem dey prefer to pursue, examples of those wey dey hunger strike and those wey get problem of wetin to eat go counter wetin I talk. 

So,when I talk about wetin dem prefer everywhere for d world, I dey talk about wetin people go prefer, not wetin dem dey always prefer. To use one science analogy, to take truly understand d universe, make people use science method – dis one nor mean say dem dey always do so, since as e clear say billions of people dey consult olden days tori than scince wey dey today for “answers.” E nor get any other way to get truth about d universe without science, but people dey free to change “truth” as “mistake,” and relax their mind with nonsense wey dey physical.

As e be, if one man wan cure infection, make he take antibiotics than to go perform Aztec rain dance. To prefer to take antibiotics than to do the rain dance na wetin dey everywhere for d world, since to dey dance nor go fit cure infections. Now, although say one madman dey wey fit cure infection imself by to dey dance , e still dey preferred everywhere for d world say if d man wan cure infection, he must take antibiotics.

For another word, if you fit get to d top of one mountain, if you dey wish for it, e nor go work. If you wan know d origin of d universe, prayer nor go fit provide answer for you. People still dey wish, and pray, but that one nor make wishing and praying dey more effective. With that one for mind, make we turn to d question of whether or not wetin dey preferred everywhere for d world fit be true.

### Arguments And Everywhere for the world

If I choose to argue, I don accept many different premise wey worth my time to stop here.

#### Premise 1: We Both Exist

If I choose to debate with you, then I necessarily must accept that we both exist. If believe that I exist, but you do not, then debating makes no sense, and would be the action of a madman. If I were to start arguing with my reflection in a mirror, I should be sedated, not debated.

#### Premise 2: The Senses Have The Capacity For Accuracy

Since human beings cannot communicate psychically, all debates necessarily involve the evidence of the senses. Writing presupposes sight; talking requires hearing; Braille requires touch. Thus any proposition that depends upon the invalidity of the senses automatically self-destructs.

#### Premise 3: Language Has The Capacity For Meaning

Similar to Premise Two, since all arguments require language, any proposition that rests on the premise that language is meaningless is immediately disproven. Using language to argue that language has no meaning is like using a courier to send a message arguing that couriers never deliver messages.

#### Premise 4: Correction Requires Universal Preferences

If you correct me on an error that I have made, you are implicitly accepting the fact that it would be *better* for me to correct my error. Your preference for me to correct my error is not subjective, but objective, and universal.

You don’t say to me: “You should change your opinion to mine because I would prefer it,” but rather: “You should correct your opinion because it is objectively incorrect.” My error does not arise from merely disagreeing with you, but as a result of my deviance from an objective standard of truth. Your argument that I should correct my false opinion rests on the objective value of truth – i.e. that truth is *universally preferable* to error, and that truth is *universally objective*.

#### Premise 5: An Objective Methodology Exists For Separating Truth From Falsehood

If you disagree with me, but I tell you that you must agree with me because I am always right, it is unlikely that you would be satisfied by the rigour of my argument. If you provided good reasons as to why I was wrong, but I just kept repeating that I was right because I am *always* right, our interaction could scarcely be categorised as a debate.

The moment that I provide some sort of objective criterion for determining truth from falsehood, I am accepting that truth is more than a matter of opinion.

This does not necessarily mean that my objective criteria are *logical* – I could refer you to a religious text, for example. However, even if I do so, I am still accepting that the truth is something that is arrived at independent of mere personal assertion – that an objective methodology exists for separating truth from falsehood.

#### Premise 6: Truth Is Better Than Falsehood

If I tell you that the world is flat, and you reply that the world is not flat, but round, then you are implicitly accepting the axiom that truth and falsehood both exist objectively, and that truth is better than falsehood.

If I tell you that I like chocolate ice cream, and you tell me that you like vanilla, it is impossible to “prove” that vanilla is objectively better than chocolate. The moment that you correct me with reference to objective *facts*, you are accepting that objective facts exist, and that objective truth is *universally preferable* to subjective error.

#### Premise 7: Peaceful Debating Is The Best Way To Resolve Disputes

If I tell you that the world is flat, and you pull out a gun and shoot me, this would scarcely be an example of a productive debate. True, our disagreement would have been “resolved” – but because only one of us was left standing at the end.

If you told me in advance that you would deal with any disagreement by shooting me, I would be unlikely to engage in a debate with you. Thus it is clear that any debate relies on the implicit premise that evidence, reason, truth and objectivity are the *universally preferable* methods of resolving disputes between individuals. It would be completely illogical to argue that differences of opinion should be resolved through the use of violence – the only consistent argument for the *value* of violence is the use of violence.[^4]

In essence, then, debating requires an objective methodology, through meaningful language, in the pursuit of universal truth, which is objectively preferable to personal error.

This preference for universal truth is not a preference of *degree*, but of *kind*. A shortcut that reduces your driving time by half is twice as good as a longer route – but both are *infinitely preferable* to driving in the completely wrong direction.

In the same way, the truth is not just “better” than error – it is *infinitely preferable*, or required.

#### Premise 8: Individuals Are Responsible For Their Actions

If I argue that human beings are not responsible for their actions, I am caught in a paradox, which is the question of *whether or not I am responsible for my argument, and also whether or not you are responsible for your response*.

If my argument that human beings are *not* responsible for their actions is true, then I am not responsible for my argument, and you are not responsible for your reply. However, if I believe that you are not responsible for your reply, it would make precious little sense to advance an argument – it would be exactly the same as arguing with a television set.[^5]

Thus, fundamentally, if I tell you that you are not responsible for your actions, I am telling you that it is universally preferable for you to believe that preference is impossible, since if you have no control over your actions, you cannot choose a preferred state, i.e. truth over falsehood. Thus this argument, like the above arguments, self-destructs.

[^4]: It will be useful to keep this particular premise in mind, since it will be very important later on.

[^5]: The question of responsibility is, of course, closely related to the question of free will versus determinism, which will be the subject of another book.
