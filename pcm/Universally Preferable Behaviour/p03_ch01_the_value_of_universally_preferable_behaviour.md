## The Value Of Universally Preferable Behaviour

## The Importance Of Behaviour Wey Everybody Agree With.

A new theory is of precious little value if it only points out the obvious. If physics only provided an accurate description of how we catch a ball, then physics would not be a very worthwhile pursuit, because we already can catch a ball. Discovering that the world is round only aids in long-distance navigation across the sea – it does nothing to help us get down-town Quantum mechanics only becomes useful when other methodologies cannot provide the necessary accuracy – it does not help in building a car.

New theory nor get many importance if e show wetin we already know. If e be say physic give us only the scope of how to catch ball, we nor for follow physics because we sabi how to catch ball already. 
As we don discover say this world dey round, e go only help us to travel far on top water, but e nor go fit do anything to help us travel for land.
Quantum Mechanics go only dey useful when other method nor fit give us the accuracy wey we need, E nor fit help us build car.


In the same way, the UPB framework, and the moral rules that it validates or rejects, should ideally provide us with some startling insights about the world that we live in, and our relations to each other.

Na the same way, wey the UPB framework and the rules of better behavior wey e agree or no agree with, suppose give us small understanding and idea about this world wey we dey inside, and how we go take relate with other people.


If all that UPB did was to prove that rape, murder and theft are morally wrong, it would not add much value, since almost no one believes that those things are morally right to begin with.

If everything wey UPB do na to prove sey rape, killing and robbing na bad things, e for dey less important, since na everybody wey already know sey those things no follow for good behavior.

Thus let us begin applying this framework to the world that we live in, and see what value comes out of it.

So make all of us start to put this framework inside the world wey we dey, make we see how e go benefit later.
