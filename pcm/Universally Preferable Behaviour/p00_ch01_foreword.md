## Foreword

For dem fairy tori, one bad beast dey wey get plenty power, a dragon or na basilisk, wey dey disturb evry evry. Dem village people dem too dey fear dis monster; dem dey giv dem animal say mke d monster take, dem dey pay ego and blood so mke d monster no too dey peme dem. 

Plenty of dem person pikin dey cower for d shadow of dis beast, wey dem dey call dia fear "prudence," but small for dem - wey don high for courage or craze - wan fight. Na evry year, evry dem 10 years, wave afta wave wey be say dem hopeful champions wan try put all dem power, virtue and cunning against dis bad tyrant.

Try and fail.

D beast no fit peme, so dem village people no fit hope say dis bad tyrant go comot wit time. D beast no dey normal atall, and no get mind to trade, and so una no fit follow am relate.

Dem desperate village people’ just dey hope say make one person pikin com helep dem finish d beast.

For sure, one person pikin comot wey make evry person dey wonder say wich kyn tin be dis. Na pikin for stable, shoemaker’s pikin, learner for baker’s - or e fit, just be vagabond.

Dis book na d tori of my personal attack on dis kyn of beast.

Dis “beast” na d belief say una no fit define system wey dey objective, rational, secular and scientific ethical. Dis “beast” na d illusion say morality go everly dey lost for d irrational swamps of dem gods and dem governments, wey dem enforce for dem reasons wey dey pragmatic, but wey no get logical justification and beta definition at all.  This “beast” is the belief that it is impossible to define an objective, rational, secular and scientific ethical system. Dis “beast” na d fantasy say virtue, person greatest jolly, our deepest happiness, make we put am for one corner by secular dem bros, and make we leave am for dust to paw on am, wey dem men of God and dem politicians - dem mama and papa dey parade and exploit. Dis “beast” na d yeye tinking say, without our mama and papa shout, d bullying of dem gods or d guns of dem governments, we no fit dey normal and good for same time.

Dis beast don derep many strong person, from Socrates reach Plato reach Augustine reach Hume reach Kant reach Rand.

D cost for man pikin too much.

Since we neva fit give beta definition for system of universal morality wey dey normal, dey don force us make we dey give our pikin religious horror tori, or make we give guns, prisons and dem soldier people to shikini monopoly of controllers wey no get heart wey dey call demself “the state”.

Since wetin we call “ethics” still dey subjective and merely *cultural*, for sure we go finally dey rely on top bullying, fear and kasala to enforce social rules. Since ethics no get normal basis for dem scientific way, “morality” dey middle of tribal war of dem bloody mythologies, wey each gang dey fyt wella make dem take get power as how person pikin dey take loyal to “virtue”.

We no fit live without morality, but we no fit define morality objectively - na why we dey stay for empty lives wey be gragra, cynical dominance or holy holy slavery.

Intellectually, no higher stakes dey dis world. Our failure to define objective and normal moral rules don peme hundreds of millions of person pikin lives, for wars of dem religions and states.

For plenty ways, d stakes just dey high dey go.

D increase info flow for d Internet dem don make suspicions dey go up ontop a tear rubber generation wey dem dey call “virtue” no pass - or no reach - dan d self-serveing fairy tori of dia old person dem wey no bam. The holy holy lies wey dem people wey dey powere dey talk - and d complicity of people wey dey hail dem - now don clear wella pass before. 

“Truth” yansh don comot say na manipulation;  “Truth” has been exposed as manipulation; “virtue” as control; “loyalty” as slavery, and wetin dem dey call “morality” don show say na yeye puppet show wey dem do to fake dem people wey dey weak and too dey fear mke dem dey enslave demself. 

Dis realisation na im carry a tear rubber generation of nihilists com, as e do am for Germany for d nineteenth century. Dis extreme relativists keep dia attack wey dey vitriolic pass for any man pikin wey talk say any for of certainty dey. Dis post-modern genertaion dem don pass dem cultural bigotries for all dia old tori, but com dey see *all* truth just dey prejudicial assertion. Like pikin wey shine im eyes wella wey dem don put fear for im body into cynical “sense”, dey dey look all talks say na market u dey find, say all na propaganda, and say all moral exhortations na hypocritical thievery. 

Since we no gel ontop a cohesive, objective and rational framework to dey check dem moral propositions, “morality” dey middle for mysticism, and for sure im result of kasala. As dem be, before d Enlightenment, religiouse sects dem dey fight wella for control ontop d blades of aristocracy, as moral mythologies war com dey compete for control ontop d state, and all im machinery of coercion.

As morality come remain so, relative to science of dis time so, just as old days “astronomy” do for dis time astronomy - a area of mythology wey no too real, enforce through tori talks dem, threats, compulsion and dem exploitation - wey dey tanda bar any real progress toward d truth dem.  

Dis “beast” of relativistic ethics dey ontop us, wan chop us, dey justify taxation, imprisonment, censorship and wars dem. E dey enslave dem small pikin for dem state school and Sunday pews; e dey make sure say dem poor dey d soft gulags of welfare dem; e dey enslave pikin wey dem neva born for d bottomless wells of dem national debts.

As I put am down for my last book,“On Truth: The Tyranny of Illusion”, d lie wey dope pass for d centre of dem ethical theories wey neva strong wella na say dat dem theories dey always dey for dem small pikin as objectives and dem incontrovertible facts, wey be say d truth na sa dem just be mere cultural bigotries. D reason wey dem scientists no need government or a Vatican be say scientists get objective methodology wey dem dey use resolve wahala: the scientific way. D reason wey language no need power wey dey middle to guide im evolution na cos say e dey sure ontop d “free market” of demaccumulated personal person preference for style and utility dem.

D reason wey be say dis time morality - and morality for all dem old tori - dey always dey sure ontop d bullying of dem small pikin, and den to dey threaten dem old person pikin, na say na manipulative lie wey dey pretend say im be virtuous truth.

D truth be say we need morality; d lie be say dem gods and dem governments fit normally define or make dem justly enforce am.

Wetin I dey pursue for dis book na to define methodology for dem moral theories wey dey objective, consistent, clear, normal, empirical - and *true*. 

I dey sabi wella say, for dis tym so, u go dey feel a rising wave of scepticism dem. I grab d odds say some guy wey dey out dia for d Internet - d home of people wey mad wella - don solve d philosophical wahala of of dem time no dey too high like dat - in fact, dey fit close near zero so make dem dey virtually indistinguishable from am.  

No, be still *quite* zero.  

### Ground Rules 

Dem claims wey too pass ordinary eyes need proofs wey pass ordinary eyes. Say u take dis biggy biggy work so - particularly for dis shikini book so - I don give maself some basic ground rules so, wey worth going over here.[^1] 

1. I accept am wit all ma body d Humean distinction wey dey between “is” and “ought”. Moral values wey make brain no fit get am am straight from d existence of anytin wey dey for real. D fact be say all person pikin *prefer* make dem live, and make dem dey relate wit real tins dem succesfully wey go allow dem live, no fit be d basis for any of dem valid theory of ethics dem. Some person pikin clearly no wan live, and reject real tin sharparly, so dis definition of ethics dem still dey subjective and conditional.
2. Dem no fit define ethics objectively say na “that which is good for man’s survival”. Certain man pikin fit survive wella wen dem wan chop anoda man pikin, na y dis definition of ethics no fit solve d wahala of subjectivism. For biological terms, dis go dey analogous to dey describe evolutionary tendencies as “that which is good for *life’s* survival” – dis no fit make sense at all. Human society na ecosystem of interests wey dey follow dem self drag, wey just be like d rainforest, and wetin “good”for one man pikin dey com at d expense of anoda.
3. I no dey believe any “higher realm” of Ideal Forms dem. Morality no fit dey conceived of as somtin wey dey for “other universe”, weda na material or immaterial. If morality dey for some “other realm”, dey no fit put am for rigorous rational or na empirical analysis – and, as Plato self com observe am for “The Republic”, society go com nid an elite cadre of Philosopher-Kings to relate – or, more accurately make dem kuku, *enforce* - dis edicts wey una no fit understand wey com from “other realm” ontop all dem man pikin. Dis one self no solve d wahala of subjectivism, since wetin wey no fit reach to reason and evidence na by definition subjective. 
4. I no believe say morality fit dey defined or determined wit reference to “arguments from effect”, or d ethical propositions gbege wey dem don talk say go shele. Utilitarianism, or “the greatest good for the greatest number”, no dey solve d wahala of subjectivism, since d odds of any central planner wey sabi wetin dey objectively beta for all man pikin wan reach d same as any central economic planner wey sabi how to efficiently allocate resources when pice no dey – na correct zero. Also, dat which dem dey tink say na “the greatest good for the greatest number” dey change as culture, knowledge, time and circumstances, dey change wey be say dis one self no solve d wahala of subjectivism. We no dey judge d value of scientific experiments dem according to some of dem Platonic higher realm, or some utilitarian optimization – dem judge dem in accordance wit d scientific way. I go take d same way for dis book.
5. I no gree to define ethics say im be “positive law doctrine”. Although na evry evry gree say dem legal systems dey build ontop system of ethics, no one fit com argue say evry law wey dey inside evry legal system na d correct reflection of dem morality wey sure pass. Law no fit mirror straight *any* objective theory of ethics, since laws dey continual state of flux, wey dem dey overturn, abandon and invent evry tym – and dem legal systems for d world dey often tackle demself straight, even for d theoretical level. Sharia law dey often tackle Anglo-Saxon common-law straight, and d democratic “mob rule” process for dis tym dey look lyk say e wan resemble Mafia shoot-out pass sober implementation of ethical ideals.
6. I dey open to d proposition say notin dey wey be ethics at all, and dat all dose systems of “morality” na just tins wey dem dey use control, as Nietzsche dey always voice out. For dis book, I dey start from say notin like ethics dey, and I wan build my framework from dia.
7. I dey giv beta salute for d ethical *instincts* of all man pikin. D near-universal social no do dis no do dat wey dey ontop murder, rape, assault and theft na facts wey any normal ethicist dey trowey. Aristotle voice out say any ethical theory wey fit prove say rape dey moral go get somtin wey no dey normal wit am, make we talk am small. Thus, after I don develop d framework to dey validate ethical theories, I run dis moral premises wey evry evry accept through dat framework, make I take see if na dem hold true or dem no hold.
8. I salute ur intelligence reach to stop from defining words wey be like “reality”, “reason”, “integrity” and so on. We get enough work wey we wan do without say we just reinvent d wheel.
9. Last last, I believe say any theory – especially d one wey dey fundamental as theory of ethics – dey do shikini good if e just confam wetin evry body don sabi instinctively. I neva use years of my life dey work ontop theory of ethics in order to run around to talk say “murder is wrong”. For my own eyes, d best theories wey beta pass na d ones wey dey verify d truths wey all of us intuitively grab – and den use dose principles to expose d new truths dem wey fit dey completely counter-intuitive. 

I don spend d last few years of my life to dey prepare, train, and den tackle dis beast, I hope say I don acquit maself wit some measure of honour. I believe say I don com out as Oga – though no be all unscathed – and I dey look forward to see person wey dey see wetin I dey see so.[^2]

Na history of philosophy I read for graduate school, and I get Masters degree, but I no get PhD for philosophy. I neva reach dt intellectual wey evry evry sabi. While I no fit be d *most* unlikely champion, I neva reach d most likely. Whether I don make am or not no be u go talk am, and no be me self go talk am.

If d reasoning dey, d biggy beast don go down be dat.

### One Modest Suggestion

Na d height of audacity to tell dem readers how to dey read book, but as d challenge of d work dey for our front so, I for like suggest something before we start.

If na d fifteenth century we live, and I dey try tell u say d world dey round, I go put forward d reams of dem mathematical and physical proofs. If u get anoda opinion wey different, you go reply naturally wit skepticism, and go dey inclined to quibble wit evry line of proof wey dey. However, if me and you fit sail around d world, and com back wia we start witout retracing our steps, you go for sure accept d conceptual proofs for wetin u just *experienced* say e true. You fit see fault wit one particular logical step or metaphor, but u go gree wit d conclusion, and thus go dey more open to helep correct dem details rather dan make dem reject all dem theory.

If my work na to dey reply to evry possible objection to evry linguistic, logical and empirical step, dis book no go ever finish – and dem no go read am. Perfectionism na, in essence, procrastination, and I take d work of dis book say e too make sense – and d gobe of false morality too grave and imminent – to dey use so long to dey try say we wan make heaven wey all of us cme end for hell.

Thus I jejely suggest say make u chillax see how effective d ethical framework I propose dey for proving d accepted moral maxims wey beta pass of dem man pikin before dem pass d final judgement ontop d theory.

I truly believe say d definition of a normal ethical framework na d main beta work wey dey face man pikin. I truly appreciate ur interest for dis serious matter – and I go like as evry time to greet dem kind wonderful donators wey make dis work work wella. 

I ride enta fyt wey odas arm me.

[^1]:Na most of dis tins we go talk about wella for all dis book so.

[^2]: Of course, If I don fail, I sha don fail spectacularly, wey be say e dey edifying and entertaining itself!
