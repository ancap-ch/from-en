## Foreword

For dem fairy tori, one bad beast dey wey get plenty power, a dragon or na basilisk, wey dey disturb evry evry. Dem village people dem too dey fear dis monster; dem dey giv dem animal say mke d monster take, dem dey pay ego and blood so mke d monster no too dey peme dem. 

Plenty of dem person pikin dey cower for d shadow of dis beast, wey dem dey call dia fear "prudence," but small for dem - wey don high for courage or craze - wan fight. Na evry year, evry dem 10 years, wave afta wave wey be say dem hopeful champions wan try put all dem power, virtue and cunning against dis bad tyrant.

Try and fail.

D beast no fit peme, so dem village people no fit hope say dis bad tyrant go comot wit time. D beast no dey normal atall, and no get mind to trade, and so una no fit follow am relate.

Dem desperate village people’ just dey hope say make one person pikin com helep dem finish d beast.

For sure, one person pikin comot wey make evry person dey wonder say wich kyn tin be dis. Na pikin for stable, shoemaker’s pikin, learner for baker’s - or e fit, just be vagabond.

Dis book na d tori of my personal attack on dis kyn of beast.

Dis “beast” na d belief say una no fit define system wey dey objective, rational, secular and scientific ethical. Dis “beast” na d illusion say morality go everly dey lost for d irrational swamps of dem gods and dem governments, wey dem enforce for dem reasons wey dey pragmatic, but wey no get logical justification and beta definition at all.  This “beast” is the belief that it is impossible to define an objective, rational, secular and scientific ethical system. Dis “beast” na d fantasy say virtue, person greatest jolly, our deepest happiness, make we put am for one corner by secular dem bros, and make we leave am for dust to paw on am, wey dem men of God and dem politicians - dem mama and papa dey parade and exploit. Dis “beast” na d yeye tinking say, without our mama and papa shout, d bullying of dem gods or d guns of dem governments, we no fit dey normal and good for same time.

Dis beast don derep many strong person, from Socrates reach Plato reach Augustine reach Hume reach Kant reach Rand.

D cost for man pikin too much.

Since we neva fit give beta definition for system of universal morality wey dey normal, dey don force us make we dey give our pikin religious horror tori, or make we give guns, prisons and dem soldier people to shikini monopoly of controllers wey no get heart wey dey call demself “the state.”

Since wetin we call “ethics” still dey subjective and merely *cultural*, for sure we go finally dey rely on top bullying, fear and kasala to enforce social rules. Since ethics no get normal basis for dem scientific way, “morality” dey middle of tribal war of dem bloody mythologies, wey each gang dey fyt wella make dem take get power as how person pikin dey take loyal to “virtue.”

We no fit live without morality, but we no fit define morality objectively - na why we dey stay for empty lives wey be gragra, cynical dominance or holy holy slavery.

Intellectually, no higher stakes dey dis world. Our failure to define objective and normal moral rules don peme hundreds of millions of person pikin lives, for wars of dem religions and states.

For plenty ways, d stakes just dey high dey go.

D increase info flow for d Internet dem don make suspicions dey go up ontop a tear rubber generation wey dem dey call “virtue” no pass - or no reach - dan d self-serveing fairy tori of dia old person dem wey no bam. The holy holy lies wey dem people wey dey powere dey talk - and d complicity of people wey dey hail dem - now don clear wella pass before. 

“Truth” yansh don comot say na manipulation;  “Truth” has been exposed as manipulation; “virtue” as control; “loyalty” as slavery, and wetin dem dey call “morality” don show say na yeye puppet show wey dem do to fake dem people wey dey weak and too dey fear mke dem dey enslave demself. 

Dis realisation na im carry a tear rubber generation of nihilists com, as e do am for Germany for d nineteenth century. Dis extreme relativists keep dia attack wey dey vitriolic pass for any man pikin wey talk say any for of certainty dey. Dis post-modern genertaion dem don pass dem cultural bigotries for all dia old tori, but com dey see *all* truth just dey prejudicial assertion. Like pikin wey shine im eyes wella wey dem don put fear for im body into cynical “sense,” dey dey look all talks say na market u dey find, say all na propaganda, and say all moral exhortations na hypocritical thievery. 

Since we no gel ontop a cohesive, objective and rational framework to dey check dem moral propositions, “morality” dey middle for mysticism, and for sure im result of kasala. As dem be, before d Enlightenment, religiouse sects dem dey fight wella for control ontop d blades of aristocracy, as moral mythologies war com dey compete for control ontop d state, and all im machinery of coercion.

As morality come remain so, relative to science of dis time so, just as old days “astronomy” do for dis time astronomy - a area of mythology wey no too real, enforce through tori talks dem, threats, compulsion and dem exploitation - wey dey tanda bar any real progress toward d truth dem.  

Dis “beast” of relativistic ethics dey ontop us, wan chop us, dey justify taxation, imprisonment, censorship and wars dem. E dey enslave dem small pikin for dem state school and Sunday pews; e dey make sure say dem poor dey d soft gulags of welfare dem; e dey enslave pikin wey dem neva born for d bottomless wells of dem national debts.

As I put am down for my last book,“On Truth: The Tyranny of Illusion,” d lie wey dope pass for d centre of dem ethical theories wey neva strong wella na say dat dem theories dey always dey for dem small pikin as objectives and dem incontrovertible facts, wey be say d truth na sa dem just be mere cultural bigotries. D reason wey dem scientists no need government or a Vatican be say scientists get objective methodology wey dem dey use resolve wahala: the scientific way. D reason wey language no need power wey dey middle to guide im evolution na cos say e dey sure ontop d “free market” of demaccumulated personal person preference for style and utility dem.

D reason wey be say dis time morality - and morality for all dem old tori - dey always dey sure ontop d bullying of dem small pikin, and den to dey threaten dem old person pikin, na say na manipulative lie wey dey pretend say im be virtuous truth.

D truth be say we need morality; d lie be say dem gods and dem governments fit normally define or make dem justly enforce am.

Wetin I dey pursue for dis book na to define methodology for dem moral theories wey dey objective, consistent, clear, normal, empirical - and *true*. 

I dey sabi wella say, for dis tym so, u go dey feel a rising wave of scepticism dem. I grab d odds say some guy wey dey out dia for d Internet - d home of people wey mad wella - don solve d philosophical wahala of of dem time no dey too high like dat - in fact, dey fit close near zero so make dem dey virtually indistinguishable from am.  

No, be still *quite* zero.  

### Ground Rules 

Dem claims wey too pass ordinary eyes need proofs wey pass ordinary eyes. Say u take dis biggy biggy work so - particularly for dis shikini book so - I don give maself some basic ground rules so, wey worth going over here.[^1] 

1. I accept am wit all ma body d Humean distinction wey dey between “is” and “ought.” Moral values wey make brain no fit get am am straight from d existence of anytin wey dey for real. D fact be say all person pikin *prefer* make dem live, and make dem dey relate wit real tins dem succesfully wey go allow dem live, no fit be d basis for any of dem valid theory of ethics dem. Some person pikin clearly no wan live, and reject real tin sharparly, so dis definition of ethics dem still dey subjective and conditional.
2. Ethics cannot be objectively defined as “that which is good for man’s survival.” Certain individuals can survive very well by preying on others, so this definition of ethics does not overcome the problem of subjectivism. In biological terms, this would be analogous to describing evolutionary tendencies as “that which is good for *life’s* survival” – this would make no sense. Human society is an ecosystem of competing interests, just as the rainforest is, and what is “good” for one man so often comes at the expense of another.
3. I do not believe in any “higher realm” of Ideal Forms. Morality cannot be conceived of as existing in any “other universe,” either material or immaterial. If morality exists in some “other realm,” it cannot then be subjected to a rigorous rational or empirical analysis – and, as Plato himself noted in “The Republic,” society would thus require an elite cadre of Philosopher-Kings to communicate – or, more accurately, *enforce* – the incomprehensible edicts of this “other realm” upon everyone else. This also does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since that which is inaccessible to reason and evidence is by definition subjective.
4. I do not believe that morality can be defined or determined with reference to “arguments from effect,” or the predicted consequences of ethical propositions. Utilitarianism, or “the greatest good for the greatest number,” does not solve the problem of subjectivism, since the odds of any central planner knowing what is objectively good for everyone else are about the same as any central economic planner knowing how to efficiently allocate resources in the absence of price – effectively zero. Also, that which is considered “the greatest good for the greatest number” changes according to culture, knowledge, time and circumstances, which also fails to overcome the problem of subjectivism. We do not judge the value of scientific experiments according to some Platonic higher realm, or some utilitarian optimisation – they are judged in accordance with the scientific method. I will take the same approach in this book.
5. I also refuse to define ethics as a “positive law doctrine.” Although it is generally accepted that legal systems are founded upon systems of ethics, no one could argue that every law within every legal system is a perfect reflection of an ideal morality. Laws cannot directly mirror *any* objective theory of ethics, since laws are in a continual state of flux, constantly being overturned, abandoned and invented – and legal systems the world over are often in direct opposition to one another, even at the theoretical level. Sharia law is often directly opposed to Anglo-Saxon common-law, and the modern democratic “mob rule” process often seems more akin to a Mafia shoot-out than a sober implementation of ethical ideals.
6. I am fully open to the proposition that there is no such thing as ethics at all, and that all systems of “morality” are mere instruments of control, as Nietzsche argued so insistently. In this book, I start from the assumption that there is no such thing as ethics, and build a framework from there.
7. I do have great respect for the ethical *instincts* of mankind. The near-universal social prohibitions on murder, rape, assault and theft are facts that any rational ethicist discards at his peril. Aristotle argued that any ethical theory that can be used to prove that rape is moral must have something wrong with it, to say the least. Thus, after I have developed a framework for validating ethical theories, I run these generally accepted moral premises through that framework, to see whether or not they hold true.
8. I respect your intelligence enough to refrain from defining words like “reality,” “reason,” “integrity” and so on. We have enough work to do without having to reinvent the wheel.
9. Finally, I believe that any theory – especially one as fundamental as a theory of ethics – does little good if it merely confirms what everybody already knows instinctively. I have not spent years of my life working on a theory of ethics in order to run around proving that “murder is wrong.” In my view, the best theories are those which verify the truths that we all intuitively understand – and then use those principles to reveal new truths that may be completely counter-intuitive.

Having spent the last few years of my life preparing, training, and then combating this beast, I hope that I have acquitted myself with some measure of honour. I believe that I have emerged victorious – though not entirely unscathed – and I look forward to seeing who shares this view.[^2]

I studied the history of philosophy in graduate school, and hold a Masters degree, but I do not have a PhD in philosophy. I am far from a publicly recognised intellectual. While I may not be the *most* unlikely champion, I am also far from the most likely. Whether I have succeeded or not is not up to you, and it is not up to me.

If the reasoning holds, the greatest beast is down.

### A Modest Suggestion

It is the height of audacity to suggest to readers how to read a book, but given the challenges of the task before us, I would like to make one small suggestion before we embark.

If we lived in the fifteenth century, and I were trying to convince you that the world were round, I would put forward reams of mathematical and physical proofs. If you held a contrary opinion, you would naturally react with scepticism, and be inclined to quibble with every line of proof. However, if you and I could in fact sail around the world, and arrive back where we started without retracing our steps, you would be far more willing to accept the conceptual proofs for what you had already *experienced* to be true. You might find fault with a particular logical step or metaphor, but you would already agree with the conclusion, and thus would be more prone to help correct the details rather than reject the theory as a whole.

If my task were to respond to every possible objection to every linguistic, logical and empirical step, this book would remain forever unfinished – and unread. Perfectionism is, in essence, procrastination, and I consider the task of this book to be too important – and the dangers of false morality too grave and imminent – to spend so long trying to achieve heaven that we all end up in hell.

Thus I humbly suggest that you wait to see how effective the ethical framework I propose is at proving the most commonly accepted moral maxims of mankind before passing final judgement on the theory.

I truly believe that the definition of a rational ethical framework is the most essential task that faces mankind. I truly appreciate your interest in this crucial matter – and would like as always to thank the wonderfully kind donators who have made this work possible.

I ride into battle well armed by others.
