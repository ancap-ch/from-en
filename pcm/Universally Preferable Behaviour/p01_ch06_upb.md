## Ethics or Aesthetics

D way e be, we go use wetin dem dey call “aesthetic”, wey mean “beauty”  take refer to wetin dem nor go fit force us to prefer - whether na for everywhere for d world or na personal matter – while good way of behaviour refer to wetin dem fit force us to prefer. Dem prefer am  everywhere for d world to use science method take make anything wey be physical clear and true, but we nor fit use force take make d method wey science take  cause wahala for those wey nor wan use am, since e nor dey bad if if dem nor use d method wey science dey use. For real life dem fit avoid those bad actions. If person wey be physicist kon stop to dey use science way, and im kon go dey use those cards wey dem dey call “tarot card” wey dem dey use take dey interprete person life, im nor dey bad if e tell me as long as say na im own choice, and I fit even avoid am sef. Person wey dey rape person go dey use force to get wetin e want and e dey force wetin im prefer put for  person wey im  wan rape. 

Although say we first put our mind for UPB about d side wey beauty be, we fit still see UPB as one umbrella wey get many other area wey dey very important. Dem be:

- D method wey science dey follow
- Logic
- Empiricism
- Debating
- Language
- Ethics

Good way of behaviour na part of UPB wey dey talk about person bad behaviour wey other people dey suffer from, or when dem use gra gra body. Any talk wey prove am well or deny say force nor go dey na better behaviour talk, and na wetin dem require for better reasoning and experience wey dem fit prove.

Make we look three actions wey go help take get d better difference between d way wey people dey behave and d other one wey dem dey call beauty. The first one wey we go look na wetin dem dey call irrationality, wey mean wetin nor dey reasonable, d second one na lying and d third one na murder.[^9]

### No reason or understanding

Make we by talk say me and you dey argue about whether God dey exist. After I talk my own argument come out, you kon dey clap your hands for your ears, dey sing out say na God dey tell you say im dey exist, and so, all my arguments nor mean anything. As e clear, wetin you take respond to d thing wey I talk nor be wetin dem fit reason. As e kon be say I dey vex for d way you take behave, I fit look am say i fit start to just do anyhow by just to carry my gun come out and shoot you, although e go dey hard sha. I believe say  dem prefer am  everywhere for d world say make dem use better reasoning and evidence than to depend on voices wey person dey hear for im head, but dis one wey dem prefer for d world nor dey reasonable to force person do for real life sense if dem use force or gra gra style.

### Lie lie

Make we by talk say me and you put rules for ground say make we use am follow our argument, and we agree say we go judge d question if God dey really exist based on d way we dey reason and evidence. If as d argument dey go, you kon fall back to where where your faith nor kon clear, and you reject all my arguments even though wetin I talk dey reasonable and I give better evidence take support am, you nor keep to your word be dat. To put for another way, you dey talk lie lie when you talk say na sense and evidence we go take answer d question.

D difference between dis two things, one wey dem dey call something wey dem nor fit reason and d other one wey dem dey call lying na d difference between arrangement wey get contract and arrangement wey nor get contract. If I give you one hundred dollars and I waka comot, I nor fit just come back to you again for one year say you dey owe me one hundred dollars, because say na loan. If for another sense you kon agree say you go pay me d money back for one year, and you kon fail to to do so, dat one na different matter.

Make we use by use “lie lie” as example, although say you don already fuck up for your word, and you don waste my time, e nor go make sense if I just carry my gun come out and shoot you.

Na something wey make sense go fit explain why d matter be like dis.

### Murder

If you carry knife take rush attack me, na small people go argue about right take defend myself. If na to shoot you go be d only way wey I fit take defend save myself, dem go look as something wey dey regrettable but important.

### Things wey we need for better behaviour

Some kind conditions  go must exist, or accept am sef, so dat judgements wey make sense and sure pass go fit hold true and dem go apply am. As e clear, person choice and im own responsibility na wetin dem must accept without e nor give any proof. If one rock dey fall down from hill and e dey come like wetin dey bounce, and e kon crash for your car, we nor go go hold d rock responsible, since d rock nor be wetin get sense, and e nor go fit choose, and e nor go fit do wetin person dey do. If d rock kon use force take comot for road a e dey come due to d way d ground be, then, no one go dey responsible for d damage wey e go cause d car. If as e kon be say you see me push d rock comot for where e dey, you nor go blame d rock, but you go blame me. To make am worse, if e kon be say  I use force push d rock based on say na another man use gun take force me, you go blame d man wey cause am and not me.

As we don yan before, to enter any argument go need our choice to dey acceptable, even our own value and our personal responsibility.  Anyhow as e be, all dis factors dey present for d kind choice wey we get for d colour of paint for room, yet we dey scarcely dey talk say to select hue na correct choice wey good. So, there go be other things wey go must dey present so dat choice or anything wey resemble am go bam and correct.

All of us get things wey we prefer – from small personal thing (like “I like ice cream”) to something wey dey socially preferable( like “e dey good to dey on time”) and even to something wey correct and dem dey accept for d world (like “make no body kill person”.)

Na small point dey to write book about things wey person prefer – and we go fit turn to Ann Landers to discuss about behaviour wey dey prefer for our society – for  here, we go kon focus on how we go fit make this correct and good behaviour dey possible for all over d world.

### Choice

If I accept say I go come your dinner party and I kon come, and I see am say wetin dem dey talk dey offensive, I fit get up and leave – and I go also fit choose say I nor go accept another invitation from you. D strong body  wey I fit take escape or avoid things na important matter wey separate “aesthestics”, wey dem dey call beauty from  “ethics” wey dem dey call good correct behaviour.

If, anyhow as e kon be, when I decide to comot for your dinner party, you kon bounce up gidigba kon use chain take chain me join chair, as e clear, I nor longer get free choice to comot. Na from here your stubborn head kon dey grow stronger so tey e kon cross d line from beauty to good correct behaviour.

If after I talk say na only one person I go ever marry, and I kon go cheat on my wife, and she kon talk say she wan leave me, na bad thing I do to her, but d wrong thing wey I do by cheating on her go dey different from d wrong wey I go do if I lock her for underground room so dat I go prevent her make she nor fit comot. We nor go reason d wife who shoot her husband for cheating say wetin she do na correct thing wey people go like, but we go reason the regret wey she go pass through if she use force and gra gra body take run from d place wey dem lock her put. For d first case, d wife get d free choice and d mind  to leave her husband, and kasala go be wetin nor bam wey dem go use talk d matter; for d second case,  her choice to leave her husband don clean comot through d imprisonment. Cheating nor dey destroy d man or woman mind to choose; but na when im lock her go cause am.

### Avoidance

If me and you stand for on top of one tall cliff, and I kon turn to you, kon tell you say make you stand for my front, so dat I go push you make you for fall go down from d cliff, you fit look am say na suicide e be for your side instead of say na murder for my side. D reason for dis na you go fit quickly avoid yourself make you nor fall by just not stand for my front.

Na so e go be if meet you for one bar, kon tell you say: “I want make you come back to my place, so dat I go fit tie you to d bed and I go make hungry beat you to death”, if you kon come back to my place, na with better knowledge you go reason am say how long you go stay nor go come up with your decision. For another hand, I put drug for your drink, and you kon wake up see say you dey tied to my bed, e clear say na small thing you go fit do to avoid wetin happen.

Dis question about avoidance na key wey dey differentiate aesthetics from ethics. Aesthetics wey also means beauty dey applied to matter wey nor dey please person, but e nor dey remove your mind to choose.

#### Avoidance And Initiation

E get one particular issue with avoidance wey go come up later for dis book, e bam say make we talk about am now sha.

If I dey live for on top of mountain wey high well well like five thousand kilometers far from you,and I kon send you email tell you say if you ever waka for front of my house, I go shoot you, e go just dey easy for you to avoid to try am. My kind stubborn body nor make sense, but questions go must come out if you kon quickly jump enter plane, kon fly dat high mountain wey my house dey and you kon stroll pass front of my house.

For another sense, if you dey live for one kind yeye street, and I kon tell you say if you follow dat street go house, I go shoot you, how you go take avoid am go kon dey limited. You fit just hide and peep pass inside your house, or jump pass many fence for your backyard, but all of dem nor go dey convenient.

For another matter wey resemble am, if person wey represent bad criminal kon come my house and e kon threaten me say I nor pay money to am he go burn my  house, I fit avoid dat strong head or wetin e dey plan by go dey stay for another continent, but dat go look like wetin nor dey right well about how to do d matter, since I go must do something take avoid d wahala.

For dis moment, make we assume say any threat wey wan cause violence nor good, but d question of say we avoid, particularly d level when we take avoid am – dey important.  D way e be, d more wey threats  dey affect our normal  everyday life, d more e go kon dey very bad and open. If I go need to fly to another continent so dat I go fit wakaa pass front of your house, e go dey scarce to dey see am every day. If dem use bad threaten me because say I dey waka pass d only road wey lead to my house, dat one na far worse wahala for my freedom. If I take direct and some kind actions wey nor good take cause threat,dat na one thing – if I cause d threat through wetin I dey do everyday, dat one na another thing. Telling you say I go slap you if you stand with your head for moon backside na threat wey scarce – but d threat go dey very real if I tell you say I go slap you if you breathe.

### Ethics, Aesthetics, And Avoidability

Make we by talk say me and you agree to meet for one place by six o’clock sharp – but I kon go show up one hour late. How your reaction go be? At first, you fit dey vex small. If I tell you say I delay because I stop to help one man wey wan die kon give am CPR and im life kon save, na sweet mind go replace  your vex-nation. For  another sense, if I tell you say I come late because I dey play video game, your vex-nation go increase. Man wey dey die need for  CPR dey unexpected and so dem nor go fit avoid am – you fit avoid to dey continue to dey play video game and e clear say you get lack of consideration.

Na dis capacity to avoid matter go form one thing wey go take our focus to how to judge  correct good behaviour. Woman wey intruder rape for her own house na complete victim of one kind terrible crime. Woman wey dem rape after she don drink kon drunk herself for party and she kon dey dance naked on top of table, her matter get as e be if dem reason am. As e clear, dem nor fit avoid d rape as e dey come, since na force dem take do am – anyhow e be, dem fit avoid something wey fit cause rape.

If somebody kon break enter my house and e kon use gun take collect my wallet, I get every right to dey para and begin cause kasala. If anyhow e kon be, I forget my wallet for bench for one park for one week, I go get d same right to dey para and cause wahala? For our sense we feel na wetin nor go too bam to prove.

As e clear na dis question of avoidance dey d center of d way wey dey check wetin e cause and d effect wey e get. Sickness wey dey strike without warning and dem nor fit prevent am, dey fear us pass those wey dem go fit avoid. We nor go fit reduce d chances to get lung cancer by to stop to dey smoke, just as we go fit prevent skin cancer if we use sunscreen, and even avoid bone to break if we nor too dey do too much sport.  As e take similar, we go fit do much to avoid crime by jejely dey do things well, like we choose person wey get better sense and behaviour, and to dey avoid places where bad bad things full well well, and even to dey stop ourself for wetin bad well well.

E get something wey dem dey call “death by cop”, where people wey fit commit suicide go provoke police, and dem go  stretch hand to cafrry gun so dat d police to shoot dem. Dis na correct and tight example wey dem take dey follow situation where victims dey sure well. Dis one fit still occur backyard where one wife go use words take attack her husband, and she know say if e don drink e dey provoke im temper d more. For all dis situation, we fit get sympathy for d man wey dey steal im wallet for park, or d woman wey dem attack kon rape for party,or d wife wey her husband beat – but at d same time we go get some important question about d role when dem play for d wrong wey dem suffer. Make e be wetin dem prove well,  we go must differentiate between dat man wey dem use gun take steal im wallet,and d man wey leave im wallet for ground for public place. Na two of dem wallet dem steal, to dey sure, but e go dey scarce to reason say make we hold accountable d same way.

UPB framework go fit make us understand, put dem for class and spread dis better correct behaiour?

[^9]: Abeg know say example wey dey below nor be proof, but dem be situations wey  true better behaviour go fit carry and explain. We go enter d actual proof now.
