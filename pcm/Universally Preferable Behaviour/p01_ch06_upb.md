## Ethics or Aesthetics

D way e be, we go use wetin dem dey call “aesthetic,” wey mean “beauty”  take refer to wetin dem nor go fit force us to prefer - whether na for everywhere for d world or na personal matter – while good way of behaviour refer to wetin dem fit force us to prefer. Dem prefer am  everywhere for d world to use science method take make anything wey be physical clear and true, but we nor fit use force take make d method wey science take  cause wahala for those wey nor wan use am, since e nor dey bad if if dem nor use d method wey science dey use. For real life dem fit avoid those bad actions. If person wey be physicist kon stop to dey use science way, and im kon go dey use those cards wey dem dey call “tarot card” wey dem dey use take dey interprete person life, im nor dey bad if e tell me as long as say na im own choice, and I fit even avoid am sef. Person wey dey rape person go dey use force to get wetin e want and e dey force wetin im prefer put for  person wey im  wan rape. 

Although say we first put our mind for UPB about d side wey beauty be, we fit still see UPB as one umbrella wey get many other area wey dey very important. Dem be:

- D method wey science dey follow
- Logic
- Empiricism
- Debating
- Language
- Ethics

Good way of behaviour na part of UPB wey dey talk about person bad behaviour wey other people dey suffer from, or when dem use gra gra body. Any talk wey prove am well or deny say force nor go dey na better behaviour talk, and na wetin dem require for better reasoning and experience wey dem fit prove.

Make we look three actions wey go help take get d better difference between d way wey people dey behave and d other one wey dem dey call beauty. The first one wey we go look na wetin dem dey call irrationality, wey mean wetin nor dey reasonable, d second one na lying and d third one na murder. [^9]

### No reason or understanding

Make we by talk say me and you dey argue about whether God dey exist. After I talk my own argument come out, you kon dey clap your hands for your ears, dey sing out say na God dey tell you say im dey exist, and so, all my arguments nor mean anything. As e clear, wetin you take respond to d thing wey I talk nor be wetin dem fit reason. As e kon be say I dey vex for d way you take behave, I fit look am say i fit start to just do anyhow by just to carry my gun come out and shoot you, although e go dey hard sha. I believe say  dem prefer am  everywhere for d world say make dem use better reasoning and evidence than to depend on voices wey person dey hear for im head, but dis one wey dem prefer for d world nor dey reasonable to force person do for real life sense if dem use force or gra gra style.

### Lie lie

Make we by talk say me and you put rules for ground say make we use am follow our argument, and we agree say we go judge d question if God dey really exist based on d way we dey reason and evidence. If as d argument dey go, you kon fall back to where where your faith nor kon clear, and you reject all my arguments even though wetin I talk dey reasonable and I give better evidence take support am, you nor keep to your word be dat. To put for another way, you dey talk lie lie when you talk say na sense and evidence we go take answer d question.

D difference between dis two things, one wey dem dey call something wey dem nor fit reason and d other one wey dem dey call lying na d difference between arrangement wey get contract and arrangement wey nor get contract. If I give you one hundred dollars and I waka comot, I nor fit just come back to you again for one year say you dey owe me one hundred dollars, because say na loan. If for another sense you kon agree say you go pay me d money back for one year, and you kon fail to to do so, dat one na different matter.

Make we use by use “lie lie” as example, although say you don already fuck up for your word, and you don waste my time, e nor go make sense if I just carry my gun come out and shoot you.

Na something wey make sense go fit explain why d matter be like dis.

### Murder

If you carry knife take rush attack me, na small people go argue about right take defend myself. If na to shoot you go be d only way wey I fit take defend save myself, dem go look as something wey dey regrettable but important.

### Things wey we need for better behaviour

Some kind conditions  go must exist, or accept am sef, so dat judgements wey make sense and sure pass go fit hold true and dem go apply am. As e clear, person choice and im own responsibility na wetin dem must accept without e nor give any proof. If one rock dey fall down from hill and e dey come like wetin dey bounce, and e kon crash for your car, we nor go go hold d rock responsible, since d rock nor be wetin get sense, and e nor go fit choose, and e nor go fit do wetin person dey do. If d rock kon use force take comot for road a e dey come due to d way d ground be, then, no one go dey responsible for d damage wey e go cause d car. If as e kon be say you see me push d rock comot for where e dey, you nor go blame d rock, but you go blame me. To make am worse, if e kon be say  I use force push d rock based on say na another man use gun take force me, you go blame d man wey cause am and not me.

As we don yan before, to enter any argument go need our choice to dey acceptable, even our own value and our personal responsibility.  Anyhow as e be, all dis factors dey present for d kind choice wey we get for d colour of paint for room, yet we dey scarcely dey talk say to select hue na correct choice wey good. So, there go be other things wey go must dey present so dat choice or anything wey resemble am go bam and correct.

All of us get things wey we prefer – from small personal thing (like “I like ice cream”) to something wey dey socially preferable( like “e dey good to dey on time”) and even to something wey correct and dem dey accept for d world (like “make no body kill person.”)

Na small point dey to write book about things wey person prefer – and we go fit turn to Ann Landers to discuss about behaviour wey dey prefer for our society – for  here, we go kon focus on how we go fit make this correct and good behaviour dey possible for all over d world.

### Choice

If I accept say I go come your dinner party and I kon come, and I see am say wetin dem dey talk dey offensive, I fit get up and leave – and I go also fit choose say I nor go accept another invitation from you. D strong body  wey I fit take escape or avoid things na important matter wey separate “aesthestics,” wey dem dey call beauty from  “ethics” wey dem dey call good correct behaviour.

If, anyhow as e kon be, when I decide to comot for your dinner party, you kon bounce up gidigba kon use chain take chain me join chair, as e clear, I nor longer get free choice to comot. Na from here your stubborn head kon dey grow stronger so tey e kon cross d line from beauty to good correct behaviour.

If after I talk say na only one person I go ever marry, and I kon go cheat on my wife, and she kon talk say she wan leave me, na bad thing I do to her, but d wrong thing wey I do by cheating on her go dey different from d wrong wey I go do if I lock her for underground room so dat I go prevent her make she nor fit comot. We nor go reason d wife who shoot her husband for cheating say wetin she do na correct thing wey people go like, but we go reason the regret wey she go pass through if she use force and gra gra body take run from d place wey dem lock her put. For d first case, d wife get d free choice and d mind  to leave her husband, and kasala go be wetin nor bam wey dem go use talk d matter; for d second case,  her choice to leave her husband don clean comot through d imprisonment. Cheating nor dey destroy d man or woman mind to choose; but na when im lock her go cause am.

### Avoidance

If you and I are both standing at the top of a cliff, and I turn to you and say, “Stand in front of me, so I can push you off the cliff,” what would your response be? If you do voluntarily stand in front of me, and I then push you off the cliff, this would more likely be considered a form of suicide on your part, rather than murder on my part. The reason for this is that you can very easily *avoid* being pushed off the cliff, simply by refusing to stand in front of me.

Similarly, if I meet you in a bar, and say: “I want you to come back to my place, so I can tie you to the bed and starve you to death,” if you do in fact come back to my place, it is with the reasonable knowledge that your longevity will not be enhanced by your decision. On the other hand, if I slip a “date rape” drug into your drink, and you wake up tied to my bed, it is clear that there is little you could have done to avoid the situation.

This question of *avoidance* is key to differentiating aesthetics from ethics. Aesthetics applies to situations that may be unpleasant, but which do not eliminate your capacity to choose.

#### Avoidance And Initiation

There is a particular issue with avoidance that will come up later in this book, which is worth clearing up here beforehand.

If I live on a high mountaintop five thousand kilometres away from you, and send you an e-mail telling you that if you ever walk in front of my house, I am going to shoot you, it is relatively easy for you to avoid this situation. My threat of force is certainly immoral, but questions would surely be raised if you immediately jumped on a plane, climbed my mountain and slowly strolled in front of my house.

On the other hand, if you live on a dead-end street, and I tell you that if you take that street to get home, I will shoot you, your capacity to avoid this situation becomes significantly limited. You could certainly tunnel into your house, or jump over a bunch of backyard fences, but all of this would be considerably inconvenient.

In a similar manner, if a representative of organised crime comes to my house and threatens to burn it down if I do not pay regular protection money, I can avoid that specific threat by moving to another continent, but that would seem like a rather unjust way to deal with the situation, since I must now initiate action in order to avoid the threat.

For the moment, we can assume that *any* threat of the initiation of violence is immoral, but the question of avoidance – particularly the *degree* of avoidance required – is also important. In general, the more that a threat interferes with the normal course of daily actions, the more egregious it is. If I have to fly to another continent in order to walk in front of your house, that is scarcely an everyday activity. If I am threatened with violence for walking down the only road towards my own home, that is a far worse intrusion upon my liberties. If I have to take specific and unprecedented action to trigger a threat, that is one thing – if I trigger the threat through normal everyday activities, that is quite another. Telling you I will slap you if you stand on your head on the dark side of the moon is scarcely a threat – telling you I will slap you if you *breathe* is.

### Ethics, Aesthetics, And Avoidability

Let’s say that you and I agree to meet at a certain location at six o’clock sharp – but then I show up half an hour late. What would your reaction be? At first, you may be a little annoyed. If I tell you that I was delayed because I stopped to give a dying man CPR and saved his life, your annoyance would likely be replaced with admiration. On the other hand, if I tell you that I am late because I was playing a video game, your annoyance would probably increase. A dying man’s need for CPR is unexpected, and therefore pretty much unavoidable – continuing to play a video game is easily avoidable, and clearly shows a lack of consideration for you.

It is this capacity to *avoid* situations that forms a central root of ethical judgements A woman raped by a random intruder in her own home is undoubtedly the complete victim of a terrible crime. A woman who gets raped after getting blind drunk at a frat party and dancing naked on a tabletop presents a more complicated case. Clearly the rape, once under way, cannot be avoided, since it is being violently inflicted – however, situations which increase the likelihood of rape can be avoided.

If someone breaks into my house and takes my wallet at gunpoint, I have every right to be outraged. If, however, I leave my wallet sitting on a park bench for a week, do I have the same right to be outraged when I return to find it gone? Instinctively we feel that this would seem to be less justified.

Clearly, this question of avoidance is central to our moral evaluation of cause and effect. Illnesses that strike without warning, and which cannot be prevented, frighten us far more than those that we can avoid. We can minimise the chances of getting lung cancer by refraining from smoking, just as we can help prevent skin cancer by using sunscreen, and avoid broken bones by eschewing extreme sports. Similarly, we can do much to avoid crime through some fairly simple habits, such as choosing moral companions, avoiding locales and situations where crime is more probable, refraining from substance abuse and so on.

There is a phenomenon known as “death by cop,” wherein suicidal people provoke an altercation with the police, then pretend to reach for a gun in order to get shot. This is an extreme example of pursuing situations where “victimisation” is almost guaranteed. This can also occur in domestic situations, wherein a wife will verbally attack a drunken husband, knowing perfectly well that alcohol inflames his violent temper. In these situations, we can have some sympathy for the man whose wallet is stolen in the park, or the woman who is attacked at the frat party, or the wife who is beaten by her husband – but at the same time, we would have some significant questions regarding their role or complicity in the wrongs they have suffered. To be just, we must differentiate between a man whose wallet is stolen at gunpoint, and a man who leaves his wallet lying around in a public place. Both men have had their wallets stolen, to be sure, but it would scarcely seem reasonable to hold them equally accountable.

Can the UPB framework help us understand, classify and extend these moral standards?
