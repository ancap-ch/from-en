## Parallels

Before science kon take everywhere, people be dey  reason am say na unthinkable thing for our natural world to fit survive alone without living with open eye common  sense  whether something dey right or wrong. D  sun dey shine well well like a spiritual warrior; d moon just jejely dey shine small and e kon be d lonely brother wey sun get.  Olden days stories about gods na common tori wey dem dey yan all d time, and storms dey happen when demons dey vex.

Dat sense wey say nature dey survive on im own and fit grow by imself na wetin people nor fit imagine. D  Darwinian revolution, d research about life say dem nor create life, but na life come out on im own,  kon bring out the idea from ordinary material to biological world.

Before science kon dey exist, inside d centre of evri complex system na correct good consciousness dey for inside – wey e be say if d correct sense nor dey, na wahala and scatter scatter everitin go be, and e go stop d system to exist.

But as e kon be, e kon bad. D correct good consciousness na wetin nor be real, na false idea, make e nor kon be like say e bad. Nothing like those gods dey exist, and those wey dem think say e dey exist na mouth of their priest dem for hear am. Wetin e really be na d yeye people wey nor dey reason well, dem nor even know d kind mumu wey dem be.

We go soon put dis same sense for d mind of people wey dey d society – and as e kon be now, e dey important say we do am.

We make am dey important, say inside d centre of society we put one correct thing wey dem dey call “government.” If dis government nor dey, we go see am say true true d society go enter wahala and scatter scatter, and d world go stop – just as our olden days papa and mama think am say if their gods nor dey, na wahala go full everywhere, and  world go stop.

But as e kon be, d “government” nor dey exist as d gods nor dey exist.

When we dey talk about “gods,” we dey really talk about wetin the “priests dey think and reason.”

When we talk of “government,” na  d  “violence of small group of people” we mean.

D idea of how fast fast things about life dey happen, which dem don already prove for physics and biology,  still remain unthinkable to us wey dey for d society.

But as e kon be, “governments” nor kon dey needed again for organisation and to make d society continue to dey live just as “gods” nor dey needed again for organisation and to make d society continue to dey live.

In fact, just as religion take disturb and slow d progress of science, na so government take dey disturb and slow d progress of d society.  Just as the false idea of religion don cause hundreds of millions of people to die throughout for history, na so d false idea about d government don do.

Just as d false things and beliefs of religion dey judge any kind of abuse, corruption and violence, na so d false things and belief of the government dey be. When we kon choose to live our life by thinking and reasoning wetin nor be real, we dey choose destruction wey we nor go fit avoid in one form or d other.

When we kon choose to live in d society according wetin religion talk or say make we do, na war we go end up, violence, control under force, abuse, corruption and yeye lifestyle go be d order of d day.

When we kon choose to live in the society say make government dey control our social and economic life, d result nor make any difference.

We go fit choose either good behavior  or force person to do wetin im nor wan do

We nor go fit choose and carry d two of dem.

### Solutions

We fit choose to believe say d government na both necessary and correct people. We fit choose to believe dat,  without d government, d society go collapse to anarchy, a condition wey government nor dey and no control for the society, and d world go scatter into war with one another. We fit choose to believe dat if government nor dey, roads, education, healthcare, old-age pensions, libraries, protection of properties and many more nor go dey.

False beliefs wey resemble dis one don drop d progress of mankind throughout for history. D one reasonable talk wey UPB yan about the government na wetin science don already talk about religion before.

As science kon dey carry on practicals about d universe say d universe fit live without god, fear kon dey trouble people for mind say d world go soon end, and say d society fit collapse to lack of control without government and civilization go cause war for d world.

Any time a system wey dey judge power con dey conceived say e dey run without d power, those wey dey  profit from d manipulation of dat power go dey cry out say if dem nor dey, everything  go loss.

Priests do dis thing during dat time wey science dey take everywhere. Without God, life no get meaning at all. Without God, man no get better behavior for the society. Without God, our souls nor go save. Without God, d world go drop to evil and wahala go full everywhere.

None of dem kon turn out to be true sef. In fact, na d reverse be d case. D end of religion wey be dey top everywhere for d world kon open way for church and state to separate, d end of aristocracy (where people get level pass other people), d rise of free market, people with freedom for many important areas of d world.

D fall of God na d rise of mankind.

With dat same eye, when we start begin to look d society as d early scientists dey see d universe dat time  – say e fit survive on im own without any oga kpata kpata – then, we go start to dey see am say many possibilities of freedom for mankind dey.

D establishment of oga kpata kpata and d use of force and ojoro wey nor dey give other people chance dey reduce d progress of knowledge, of wisdom, of body and d health of d brain – just as d establishment of oga kpata kpata and d use of force in d universe dey reduce d progress of knowledge, of wisdom, and science.

D way to oppose d things wey nor be real na with truth wey no fit rest. D way to oppose God na with reason, evidence and science.

D way to oppose d state – d thing wey nor be real and dangerous pass –na with reason, evidence and science.

### D Future

Whether we like am or not, UPB dey everything wey we do. Human beings get one natural way  to dey dey consistent, since we be human beings wey sabi reason very clear, and we dey live for consistent and clear universe wey sense dey. Anything wey we accept for our life sabi push us to dey get more consistent behavior throughout our lives – and throughout d life of our culture and nation sef.

Man wey believe say force and fight na good way to get wetin im want go dey continue to dey do am over and over again for im life. Man wey believe say bad things  good go dey become more bad for im life. 

For another style of talk, UPB dey ask for life in consistency and even when e nor dey consistent. UPB dey ask for clear thing wey nor dey scatter even for  inside  immorality.

From where culture come from dey determine d future of dat culture. Culture wey dem build take dey judge people say dem dey use force go become too much force sef. Culture wey dem build on good reasoning and  freedom go become less force.

Na why d correct explanation for correct behaviour about how to live better for life dey very important.

D thing wey we believe, na dat we go become.

If we dey believe lies, na slaves and servants we go become
