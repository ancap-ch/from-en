### Governments And Religion

De idea say dem born you kon create one contract with one agency wey nor dey exist, which for real ground you resemble slave to some kind people, dey common to both religion and de state – and another one, far more agency wey be person own, which I don first talk about for my first book “On Truth: The Tyranny Of Illusion”.

Whenever one priest talk say: “Obey God”, wetin im dey really talk na: “Obey me”. Since God nor dey exist, any commandment wey de priest claim say e dey come from God, dey actually come from de priest. “God” na just wetin nor real wey dem dey use take bully you in order for dem to get your service for low level for real world, to real people, in terms of you dey hand money come out voluntarily, time and resources.

E dey far more efficient for those wey dey exploit people to get their slaves look am say slavery na power, since e cut down well well on de cost to control dem. If I fit convince you say e dey evil to avoid make you serve me, and say na power to be my slave, then, I nor need to hire many agberos to bully, control and steal from you.

Religious and state mythologies, dat time, na wetin nor real wey reduce de cost to control population well well; na dem be de oil and fuel for de deadly planning of violence wey dem arrange.

Throughout de world, rulers na very small percentage of de population. How e go fit dey possible for one or two percent of people to control everybody else? E get one certain monopoly on military weapons, to dey sure, but  monopoly dey easy to counter, since most governments dey make fortune when dem sell weapons throughout de world.

De sad reality na dat people as a whole dey  enslaved to things wey nor real like nation, gods, cultures – and governments.

Our personal pride dey use style rebel against us one quick slavery wey dem force for person to another human being – anyhow  as e be, we be like to almost dey enjoy in slavery to mythology.

Our desire to dey good – join with de thrill of power wey we dey get by to dey obey mythologies wey good – make us dey line up to willingly hand over our things to those wey dey claim to represent those mythologies.

One central reason wey we know say government and gods nor dey necessary na that dem dey effective. *We know say most people desperately wan dey good because dem dey easily controlled by theories wey good.

De logic of obedience to mythology dey clearly foolish. If one priest tell me say I need to obey “God”, dis na exactly de same as him dey tell me say I must obey wetin nor real wey dem dey call”Nog”. Even if I accept say dis thing wey nor real dey worthy to obey  forever, dis one nor go still push me to obey de priest in any way. If I tell you to “obey your heart”, I fit use reason talk say: “and *me alone* talk for your heart”?

Of course no.

When we strip comot mythology and wetin nor real for our “conversation” with our rulers, wetin go come na reality wey dey fierce, empty and e fit kill.

Make we by take as example one very real and present danger: taxation

#### Taxation

Dem tell me say, by say I choose to live for Canada, I owe “de government” more than fifty percent of my income.

Comot mythology, wetin dis thing really translate to?

For reality, I go wait until de end of time for “de government” to come and kon pick up their money. To dey wait for “de government” to drop by be like we wan date de idea of “femininity”. I fit as well try to pay for my dinner with de word “money”.

For reality, when dem tell me say I must pay my tax t “de government”, wetin e actually mean na say I must write check to transfer my money into one particular bank account, which some people go kon check. Dis people kon get de right to take de money, and spend am as dem fit – dis particular people get complete control over my money.

E nor get any point at all wey something like “de government” lift one finger, kon move, open one bank account, or spend one penny. Imagine say wetin nor real wey  dem dey call “de government” get de capacity to take or spend your money na exactly de same thing as you go wait for “God” to come kon pick you up take you go church.

So, de real conversation na one guy send me one letter dey tell me say I owe am money. I nor get contract with dis guy, and e nor own any of my property, although some other guys write one supposed “contract” wey claim say he own my property.

If I nor pay dis guy, he go send another guy come my house to kon collect de money – plus “interest” and “charges”. 

Normally, when one man with gun come my house and demand for my money, I get right to use force take defend myself. For dis case, anyhow as e be, because im dey costume and kon claim to represent something wey nor real, I nor dey allowed to use force defend myself.

Now, if I come to your house tonight and I dress as one “high elf of Narnia” and demand de money wey you dey owe de”Queen of Sorrows”, assuming say nor be Halloween, you dey allowed to dey look me with amazement, and order me to comot from your property.

If I nor pay de man who come kon take my money, he dey allowed to pull gun come out, point am for my chest, and kidnap me – or shoot me if I resist. He go fit hold me for one tiny cell year after year, where I go face de most painful brutality and constant rape, until he go choose to let me go.

As e dey interesting, if one man owe me money legally, I nor dey allowed to kidnap am and make am to face torture and rape am year after year. So, taxation totally violate de UPB framework, since na de violent transfer of property wey dem dey use force.

Stealing, as we don prove, na evil.

Einstein completely change physics by to dey claim – and prove – say de speed of light dey constant.

We go fit change de world completely by to accept de claim – and de proof – say stealing na always evil.

### Government, Religion, And UPB

When we take de UPB framework and kon apply am to correct good behaviour wey relate regarding government and religion, some result wey dey interesting go occur.

De words wey relate wey dem dey mostly use take dey prove government power na: “de government get de right to take your money”. Dis, as e be, na totally statement wey nor dey precise and be false. De “government” nor get de right to take your money, since “de government” na merely one concept, one abstract description for some certain group of people. UPB dey require one more statement wey dey consistent and get purpose. Since correct behaviour rules must be de same for everybody wey dey all place and all de time, we go must change de rule dis way:

“*Human beings fit correctly take money from other human beings if dem by make one agency wey prove say their actions good.*”

If we return to Bob and Doug for our small room for experiment of correct behavior and character, we go dey very quick to see say dis  go become one relation wey dey impossible.

If Bob say to Doug: “na me now represent de Ideal ‘FUBAR,’ which fully prove me dey take your lighter from you. Since you owe me your lighter now, you must hand am over, or I go dey pushed to take am from you with force”.

Wetin Doug’s reaction go be? Remember,  according to UPB, whatever dey true for Bob must also be true for Doug. As e nor go fit stop, Doug go reply: “Oh yeah? Well *me* represent de ‘ANTI-FUBAR’ now, wey fully prove me dey collect my lighter. Since you nor get right to take my lighter now, if you try to take am, I go dey pushed to defend myself by force”.

A s you dey see, if *Bob* get de right to make up imaginary obligations and kon impose demon Doug, then, *Doug* then *Doug* get de imaginary obligations and impose am on Bob. As e clear, we go immediately end up for one perfect draw. If e dey good to impose obligations wey dem made up for other people, but e go dey impossible to do am if *everybody* possess dat ability, then morality go come be impossible. De only way wey Bob go fit take impose obligations wey him made up on Doug na if Doug refuse to impose e own obligation for Bob – so we get one situation where wetin dey  good for one person go fit dey achieved by de other  person wey dey act for bad manner. Power go fit dey enabled by quarrel, which dey impossible – and we get good behaviour rules wey dey oppose each for two human beings for de same circumstances, which UPB dey reject say nor be true.

For other words, proof wey dey imaginary and nor clear for to dey use force go dey counter by another proof wey dey imaginary and nor clear. If I get one imaginary friend wey fit prove everything wey I do, then *you* go fit also get one imaginary friend wey fit prove everything wey you do. So, none of us go fit possess de ability to dey impose obligations wey dey imaginary on others.

#### Religion And UPB

De same hold true for religion

De statement: “You must obey me because God command am”, go must dey correct  when dem talk again as: “one thing wey I make up commands you to obey  me”. De principle wey UPB require, then, na: “Human beings must impose positive obligations wey dem nor choose on others on others, and prove those obligation according to those things wey nor real wey dey imaginary."

Here we see de same issue before. Bob tell Doug: “You must give me your lighter, because my imaginary friend tell you to give me”. Naturally, Doug kon reply: “You must nor ask me for your lighter, because*my* imaginary friend dey forbid you to ask me”. If Bob commandment dey true, then Doug commandment dey equally true, and so dem cancel each other out.

For de same way, if one man claim say e concept ewy dem dey call “de government” prove say im thief my property, then I fit claim say my concept wey I dey call “de government” prove say I collect my property back, and two of us dey true for wetin we prove.

If dis tax collector kon claim say e own concept wey dem dey call “de government” only prove say e thief my property, and e nor prove say I take my property back, then we nor dey de same place for front. He fit take my thousand dollars, but then I fit invoke my concept to “steal” dat money back, and e good behaviour theory command us to spend de rest of eternity to dey hand back and forth de thousand dollars.

#### UPB And "The Majority"

UPB nor dey allow for accumulation of people to override or reverse de property of each person. Ten lions nor dey make one elephant, one government, or one god. Ten thousand soldiers fit make one “army”, but dem nor fit revenge gravity, or make to dey  kill be good thing.

As we dey return one last time to de room of Bob and Doug, make we introduce “Jane”.

Now wey be say na three people dey de room, we fit look at de “majority rule” principle.

If Bob, Doug and Jane take one “vote” on whether or not e dey good to rape Jane, all of us fit turn in fear for such premise wey nor good and dey unjust. As e clear, even if we vote Jane pass, we fit nor consider say de rape wey go come go dey transformed to correct good act and behaviour.

Why not?

Well, UPB nor dey recognise de reality of aggregations, wey mean to dey pack things together, since de “majority” na one kind tag: e nor dey exist for reality, any more than “gods” or “government dey do. So, to dey say de idea of “de majority” get any kind good stand dey totally false – e be like to dey talk say “de fatherland” go fit impregnate one woman, or say one person fit sidown for de word “chair.

To talk say “de majority” get right or attributes  wey directly dey counter de right or attribute of any person dey also contradict principles wey dey reasonable, since any kind of grouping dey only be true by de correct pick out of person character. If I say “mammals” na warm-blooded creatures wey dey live, I go fit logically include three plastic flamingoes for de category “mammal”.?

Of course no.

So, if na evil for human being to rape, I go fit logically create one category wey dem dey call “ de majority” and then kon claim say for *dis* human beings, rape na wetin dey good?

Of *course* no.

### Majority Rule

I go fit create one moral rule wey say: “de majority go dey able to do whatever dem want?

Of course I go fit, but e nor go ever be true.

Only *people* act – de majority never do am. If moral rules fit change when one certain number of people get together, then UPB dey violated continuously.

If e dey moral for Bob and Doug to rape Jane because dem vote pass her, wetin go happen when two of Jane friends kon show up kon vote against Bob and Doug dirty desire?

Well, so soon Bob and Doug na de ones wey dem vote comot, and rape go kon be evil for dem again.

Nothing big don change for all dis vote pass scenario, but we get one series to dey oppose moral rules for de same men – one violation of UPB, and so nor be true.

Rape nor fit be good, then evil, then good again, just because some few hands dey raised or low.

So, if you think say “majority rule” sound like one reasonable good word wey relate, and na one moral theory  wey be true, then I dey fear say you go have to go back to de beginning of dis book and start all over again!☺
