## More Challenging Tests Of UPB

We don test specific moral theories wey dey relative to de framework of UPB, so tey we don find out say  UPB dey validate our most commonly held moral beliefs, wey include prohibitions against rape, murder and theft. By bringing de criterion of avoidability into our analysis, we don also help differentiate between crimes wey no fit dey avoided, and crimes wey gats dey enabled through positive action, such as fraud. Finally, we don divide “preferable behaviour” into three major categories – universal, aesthetic, and neutral (and their relevant opposites). Universally prohibited actions include rape, murder and theft,wey we fit use force prevent. Aesthetically preferable actions include politeness, being on time and so on, wey fit dey enforced through violence. Neutral actions dey include purely subjective preferences, or actions wey no get moral content, such as running for a bus.
Anyhow, many challenging moral tests that still dey wer fall outside the examples wer we don deal with above. We go only deal with a few of dose here, to have a look at the framework of UPB, so we go see how e deal with these more challenging moral questions.

### Self-Defence

Dem nor fit take de concept of self-defence for granted. If we assume say notin like  self-defence, or say self-defence nor be beta action, den de framework of UPB nor support dat kind assumption at all.

If we say no self-defence, den we nor dey talk about de initiation or de retaliation of de use of force, but rada just de use of force in any context. Dis mean say, if we get rid of de concept of self-defence, de only question  wey we get to ask ourselves na weda: *e dey universally preferable to use force, or not?*

If say e dey universally preferable to use force, den no human being suppose bring a moral argument, but rada use force take achieve im ends. Like, for de rape, theft and murder examples wey dey cited for above, de claim dat e dey universally preferable to use force go immediately invalidates itself. To dey able to use force on top anoda person mean say  dat person don submit to force – in oda words,  for one person to dey moral, de oda person must dey immoral, wey nor go fit stand. Also, if de oda person submits to force, nor be  force be dat – so he must resist, wey go mean say he need to resist virtue in order to enable virtue, wey be self-contradictory.

To add more, if e always dey preferable to use force, den crimes like rape and murder go become irrelevant, becos if e always dey preferable to use force, den love-making becomes immoral, and rape becomes moral – but only for de rapist, while submission to violence, rather than violence itself go become moral for him victim, wey be  contradiction.

If, for de oda hand, we talk say  violence dey bad, den we open up de possibility of self-defence. If na UPB-compliant statement to say dat violence na evil, den we know say, since dat wey be evil fit dey  prevented through de use of violence, de use of violence to oppose violence dey morally valid.

So, since we  don know say violence na evil, we know say we fit use force  oppose am. If, we come define  action as evil, but also prevent anybody from acting against am, den we no longer come be moral philosophers, but  we be merely judgemental archaeologists. Dis go dey be like a medical theory wey talk say illness dey bad, but say e dey evil to attempt to prevent or cure am – wey no even make sense at all.

Also, if human beings nor fit act to prevent harm to demselves, den actions like inoculations, wearing gloves for cold, putting on sunscreen or insect repellent, building a wall to prevent a landslide, brushing one’s teeth, wearing shoes and so on don become immoral actions. If we return to Bob and Doug, come give dem de moral argument that self-defence  always dey wrong, wetin go come be de results?

Well, na anoda paradox wey we go create. Self-defence na de use of violence to prevent violence. If self-defence always dey wrong, den e no fit dey violently “inflicted” upon de attacker. Anyhow, preferences wey nor fit dey inflicted upon odas fall into de APA or morally neutral category. To place de violence of self-defence into dis categories na to tok say  violence no fit dey on odas – but de very nature of violence na say e dey inflicted on odass, and so dis approach go just result into plenti  contradictions.

Self-defence nor fit be “evil”, since evil by definition fih dey prevented thru force. However, self-defence na like response to de initiation of force, and so we nor fit prevent am through force, any more dan you fit stop de motion of a soccer ball by kicking am violently.

Self-defence nor fit be required behaviour, since required behaviour (“don’t rape”) fit dey enforced through violence, wey go mean say anyone wey fail to violently defend himself fit dey legitimately aggressed against. Anyhow, person wey fail to defend imself don dey *already* aggressed against, and so we go end up for circular situation wey everyone fit legitimately act violently against  person wey no dey defend himself, wey no dey only illogical, but morally bad.

If Bob attack Doug, but e dey completely wrong for Doug to use violence to defend himself, den violence go end up into two moral categories – de initiation of force dey morally good, but self-defence dey morally evil, wey no fit stand, according to UPB.

Anyhow, you fit argue say, weda de proposition wey be say self-defence good nor dey make violence both good and bad at de same time – de violence wey dem used to attack dey bad, but de violence wey dem used for self-defence dey good?

Dis na interesting objection – anyways, if de initiation of force na evil, den e go dey prohibited by using force, since dat na one of the very definitions of evil wey we don talk about above.

So e come dey impossible for any logical moral theory to reject de moral correctness of self-defence.

### Child Raising

Instinctively, we generally understand that there is something quite wrong with parents who do not feed their babies. To conceive a child, carry a child to term, give birth to the child, and then leave it lying in its crib to starve to death, severely offends our sensibilities.

Of course, our offence is in no way a moral argument, but it is an excellent starting place to test a moral theory.

Before, when we were talking about UPB, we noted that, where there are exceptions in UPB, there must be objective differences in biology. Or, to put it more accurately, where there are objective differences in biology, there may be rational exceptions or differences in UPB. A child of five has a biologically immature brain and nervous system, and thus cannot rationally process the long-term consequences of his actions. It is the immature brain that is the key here, insofar as if an adult male is retarded to the point where his brain is the equivalent to that of a five year old, he would also have a reduced responsibility for his actions.

Thus when we point to situations of reduced responsibility, we are not *taking away* responsibility that exists, but rather recognising a situation where responsibility does not exist, at least to some degree. If I say that a man in a wheelchair cannot take the escalator, I am not taking away his right to take the escalator, but merely pointing out that he cannot, in fact, use it. When I say that UPB does not apply to the actions of a five year old, I am not saying that UPB is subjective, any more than a height requirement for a roller coaster somehow makes the concept of “tall” subjective.

If I voluntarily enter into a contract with you wherein I promise to pay your bills for a year, I have not signed myself into slavery, but I certainly have taken on a positive obligation that I am now responsible for.

If I run a nursing home, and I take in patients who are unable to feed themselves, then if I do not feed those patients, I am responsible for their resulting deaths. No one is *forcing* me to take in these patients, but once I have expressed a desire and a willingness to take care of them, then I am responsible for their continued well-being.

In the same way, if I borrow your lawnmower, I am obligated to bring it back in more or less the same state that it was when I borrowed it. Similarly, if I go to a pet store and buy a dog, I have taken on a voluntary obligation to take care of that dog. This does not mean that I am now the dog’s slave until the day it dies, but it does mean that as long as the dog is in my possession, I have a responsibility to try to keep it healthy.

These kinds of implicit contracts are quite common in life. We do not sign a contract with a restaurateur when we go to eat a meal in his restaurant; it is simply understood that we will pay before we leave. I have never signed a contract when I walk into a store promising not to shoplift, but they have the right to prosecute me if I do. I also have never signed a contract promising not to rape a woman if we go on a date, yet such a “contract” certainly exists, according to UPB.

If I run a nursing home, and disabled people rely on me to feed them, if I prove unable to feed them for some reason, then my responsibility is clearly to find somebody else who will feed them. The grave danger is not that *I* don’t feed them, but rather that everyone else thinks that I *am* feeding them, and so do not provide them food. This accords with an old moral argument about diving into a river to save someone from drowning. I am not obligated to dive into a river to save someone from drowning, but the moment that I do – or state my intention openly – then I am responsible for trying to save that person, for the very practical reason that everyone else thinks that I am going to save that person, and so may not take direct action themselves.

Thus it is assumed that parents will feed and take care of their newborn baby. If said parents decide against such care-giving, then they are obligated to give the child up to other people who *will* care for it, or face the charge of murder, just as the manager of a home for the disabled must either feed those who utterly depend on him, or give them up to someone who will. If I decide that I no longer want to take care of my dog, I must find him another home, not simply let him starve to death.

This all relies on the principle of third-party self-defence, which is fully supported by the framework of UPB, since the right of self-defence is universal. If I see a man in a wheelchair being attacked by a woman, I have the right to defend him – and this is all the more true if he lacks the capacity to defend himself.

Since children cannot feed themselves, earn a living or live independently, they are the moral equivalent of kidnap victims, or the wife we talked about before whose husband locked her in the basement. Children also lack the capacity for effective self-defence, due to their small stature and near-complete dependence upon their parents.

Thus since it is certainly the case that we have the right to act in self-defence for someone else – and that right becomes even stronger if that person cannot act in his own self-defence, it is perfectly valid to use force against parents who do not feed their children, just as it is perfectly valid to use force against the husband who is starving his wife to death by locking her in the basement.

As we also mentioned above, the less able a victim is to avoid the situation, the worse the crime is. Even the wife who ends up locked in the basement has at least *some* ownership in the matter, because she chose to marry this evil lunatic to begin with. Once she is locked in the basement, the situation is unavoidable, yet there were doubtless many clues hinting at her husband’s abusive nature, from the day she first met him.

Children, however, are the ultimate victims, because they never had any chance to avoid the situations they find themselves in. Thus we can logically establish the responsibility of parents towards their children by using the UPB framework. Since every person is responsible for the effects of his or her body, and children are an effect of the body, then parents are responsible for their children. Since everyone has the right to self-defence, for themselves and for others – since it is a universal right – then anyone can act to defend children. Since everyone must fulfil voluntary obligations, and having children is a voluntary obligation, parents must fulfil those obligations related to children. Since, through inaction, causing the death of someone completely dependent upon you is the equivalent of murder, parents are liable for such a crime.

We could of course put forward the proposition that parents do not have to take care of their children, but that is far too specific a principle to be a moral premise – it would be the same as saying “parents can murder”, which is not UPB-compliant, and so would require a biological differentiation to support an exception – and becoming a parent does not utterly overturn and reverse one’s biological nature.

Parents who starve a child to death are clearly guilty of murder. Children are born into this world in a state of involuntary imprisonment within the family – this does not mean that the family is evil, or corrupt – it is simply a statement of biological fact. Children are by the parents’ choice enslaved to the parents – this form of biological incarceration puts negligent parents in the same moral position as a kidnapper who allows his captive to starve to death, or a nurse who lets her utterly-dependent patients die of thirst.
