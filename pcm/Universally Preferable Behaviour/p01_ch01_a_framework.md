## Framework for ethics dem

Ethical propositions dey different from dem oda types of knowledge statements. If i talk say, “I like jazz”, dat one fit be true talk or make im be lie, but e no dey binding to u for any way. Ma own like for jazz na just talk of wetin I gbafun; based on my talk so, e no dey incumbent ontop u say make u like jazz or make u no like am.

Similarly, if i talk say “I like vegetables”, dat one too na just ma talk of wetin I like. However, if I talk say, “vegetables na healthy food”, den I don comot from ma own talk com enta talk wey be objective fact. E dey different from “I like ice cream”, and, “Ice cream get milk inside”.  

D fundamental difference wey dey between d talk *preference* and talk *fact* na say talk of facts dey objective, testable - and dey binding. If u value truth so, e dey incumbent ontop u make u agree say ice cream get milk inside, once wey dem don prove am.[^1]

If I talk say d world dey round, and I com give una plenty proof for wetin I talk, No be u go com determine for ur self say d talk dey true. If I fit prove am say d world dey round, den u dey bound to agree say na true, unless if u wan reject d reason and evidence dem as criteria for truth.

If I agree say dem mathematical laws dey ogbonge, I no fit arbitrarily reject a mathematical proof wey go in line wit dem laws. If I go *reject* dat kyn proof, I no fit claim say I wan accept d ogbonge of dem mathematical laws. Say I agree to dis laws mean say I dey *bound* to agree say dose proofs wey go in line wit dis laws na ogbonge. D rejection of one proof wey go in line wit normal standards na a rejection of normal standards as a whole so.

D scientific method, wey dey normal itself, and dem mathematical laws na all of dem be examples of *objective* criteria wey dem dey use establish d truth for a proposition. No be my opinion say two and two na im turn four - if u com also accept say na two and two dey turn four, you no dey subject urself to ma own just opinion, but na to a normal truth.

### Truth wey dey Objective

A central challenge wey we dey use sabi d nature of truth na d realisation say “truth” no dey exist for d world for d same way wey rock or tree dey exist.

D concept wey be “truth” na necessarily a relative term - though dat one no mean subjective or arbitrary term. D concept wey be “health” na relative term too - we compare “health” to sickness, and to dem relative standards of health too. Wetin dem dey call “good health” for person wey don reach ninety-year dem no fit call am good health for person wey don reach twenty-year. D definition of long life dey different for now dan e be five hundred years before before.

Dis one no mean . however, say d concept of “health” dey entirely relative and subjective. A ten-year-old wey leukamia wan peme am dey unhealthy if we look am for any definition - just as twenty-year-old wey dey run marathon dey healthy if we look am for any definition. for now, a man wey tey for life for ninety years get long life if we look am statistically, though dat one fit change if medical technology just suddenly dey allow us tey reach two hundred for life.

As our definition of “health” dey wide, e no cancel d former definitions dem, but e just dey extend am. Id medical technology increase make ninety-year-olds dey win marathons dem, den our definition wetin be healthy for dose wey don old go change - but e no mean say d twenty-year-old person wey dey run marathon go suddenly com be unhealthy. to dey learn algebra no dey cancel arithmetic.

Truth self dey ogbonge wey dey relative to necessity as well. Newtonian physics don dey supplanted by Einsteinian physics, wey don prove say e dey accurate for tyt situations lyk extraordinarily high gravity or speed. However, dem sailors wey dey wish to calculate d correct way across an ocean go see say Newtonian physics na im dey accurate pass, but e dey ok for ship wey wan go New York from Lisbon. D labour wey dey involve to dey learn and implement Eisteinian physics na a net negative for sailor.

As a result, d sentence “Newtonian physics no too dey accurate dan Eisteinian physics, but Newtonian physics na d beta way to calculate a ship's way” we fit call am ogbonge proposition. Newtonian physics com be *less accurate*, and *more appropriate*.

If we wan drink water wey dey pure pass, we go lyk pay thousands of dollars dem for one bottle. Unless say we get ego wella and too dey frivolous, we neva fit pay dat ego say make we just drink water. Na true say water wey pure beta for us, but d price wey da purity nid don reach threshold of diminishing return dem. So “purer dey beta, na im dey reach “purer na im worse”.

Again, dis no mean say purity of water dey utterly subjective. Water wey dem distill dey potable pass seawater.

#### Truth And Objective Reality dem

D concept of *truth* dey necessarily involve d concept of *accuracy*. If I dey try shoot an arrow pass bull's eye, d accuracy of ma shot dey ontop how my arrow com land form d centre so.

Wetin, den, be d “bull’s-eye” of truth?

Well, d *truth* of a talk dey measurable relative to how e go in line wit objective reality.

Make we put dem language challenges for one corner now, if I point to one seagull and talk say, “Dat na anvil”, I dey clearly mistaken because say anvils na inorganic, and no fit fly. D truth value of ma statement dey measured relative to dem objective facts of reality. Since wey be say Seagull no be anvil, den ma statement no true.

Naturally, dis equation between truth and reality nid say make our language and sense make dem call am relatively objective. Plenty good reasons dey to believe say both language and sense evidence dey objective; we fit enta discussion wey dey complicated ontop dis, but make e suffice to talk say since na ur eyes u dey use read book wey dem write for man pikin language, we fit agree say ur eyes, and d language we share, na d least objective wey dey enough for u make u accurately process wetin I dey write. If dem no be, we no get anytin to yarn, and u neva sabi anytin wey I don write, so dis sentence no go get meaning be dat, and dem fit com render am for “Wingdings”.

Make we assume say u fi tell d difference between d two fonts wey dey above so, we fit reasonably continue.

#### Dem Accuracy And Consistency

E no dey possible for me make I paint a cloud accurately, since for d tym wey i go use paint am, d cloud go dey change evry evry. I fit paint a *photograph* pf a cloud, wey dem don freeze in tym.

If I use one hour say I be wan paint a cloud, and den I com ask u say shey ma painting na accurate representation of dat cloud so, u must necessarily reply say no be am.

For dem oda words, wen consistency no dey, accuracy no fit dey.

Wen we dream for nyt, our perceptions be say d rules of “matter” and “energy” dey for constant state of flux - we dey immune to gravity, and den we com dey fly wen we dey elephant back, and say we dey walk through wallas. E no dey possible say make we develop a “scientific physics of dreams” dan e dey to be accurate say make we paint a cloud.

Logic, science and truth, den, no dey possible wen *consistency* no dey.

Fundamentally, d laws of logic na im dey derive from d matter and energy behaviour, at least for d perceptual level. If I tell u say make u throw a ball both up and down for d same tym, Na somtin wey no dey possible I dey ask, wey u git test as u wan talk say make u do wetin I ask for. If I tell u say make u plough both d north field and d south field for d same tym, you no go fit do am. If I deman say make u turn rose into a donkey, u no fit meet ma demand.

Perceptual reality dey consistent and objective - and e no dey from dis consistency and objectivity wey we derive from dem logic laws. Our statement about reality fit only accurately *represent* reality wey be direct result of dis consistency and objectivity so.

D fact say seagulls no arbitrarily turn enta anvils - or vice versa - na d root of our capacity to judge d talk accurately: “Dat one na seagull”. If seagulls dey change dia nature spontaneously and continually, we no go fit make maybe na tru or false talk ontop dem - or anytin for dat matter.

Dis na d root of a key criterion of d scientific method - reproducibility. If I make a universal claim say about d nature og gravity, den you suppose fit reproduce dat claim for ur own environment. If reality *no* dey consistent, den reproducibiliyu go be irrational criterion for truth wey dem wan establish.

If u be maths teacher, you no go wan accept answer wey wrong from a student, even make dat student talk say im answer dey “right” wen e put am down, but e be like say e change for d interim.

Thus we fit accept say we fit measure d vaidity of a talk relative to objective reality  both empirically, and logically. Logic as discipline dey arise as a result of d consistency of reality dem; empirical observations na ogbonge or no be ogbonge as a result of d reality nature wey dey consistence.

### D existence of "Truth"

Truth, den, fit dey measured acoording to two central criteria:

1. Truth na measure of correlation wey dey between d ideas for our minds and d consistency of rationality dem, wey be say dem derive am straight from d consistent behaviour of matter and energy wey dey d real world.[^2]
2. Truth na also measure of d correlation wey dey between d ideas for our minds and d nature and behaviour of matter and energy for d real world.[^3]

D first criterion na measure of d consistency of idease wit demself - and dat kyn consistency na requirement because say reality dey consistent im self. If I talk say, “I no dey exist”, dat one na exaple of idea wey no dey consistent im self, since I must dey exist before I talk dat kyn tin. D second criterion na measure of d accuracy of ideas wey dey relative to empirical observtions of reality wey dey objective.

#### Empiricism Versus rationality dem

We fit tink empiricism say na ability to catch a ball wey dem throw instinctively, or to measure im movement; rationality na d ability to predict and sabi d path wey d ball go pass based ontop d universal principles. Clearly, if d ball randomly go any and evry direction - and com turn into flock of doves to boot magically - we we no go fit predict dia behaviour.

Thus, since matter com follow immutable laws, our theories *about* matter suppose follow immutable laws too. If I no sabi anytin for baseball, but I dey watch baseball game wia dem players dey follow d rules, e no go dey normal say make I formulate theory about dem baseball rules wey no agree wit d behaviour of dem players wey I dey watch. Since d actions of dem players dey consistent, *any theory wey I develop ontop d rules wey dey guide dose actions suppose dey consistent too.

Dis requirement for consistency na one of dem most basic requirements for truth dem. Since reality dey consistent, theories ontop reality suppose dey consistent too.

In fact, d first hurdle wey any theory suppose overcome na dat one of *internal consistency*.

[^1]: If u no value truth, u no go neva dey dis debate - or any oda debate - for d first place!

[^2]: Normal consistency, or logic wey dey internal.

[^3]: Empirical evidence, or empiricism.
