### Five Proofs wey UPB get:

As we don discuss before, de proposition of say e nor get anytin wey be preferable behavior get plenty logical and empirical problem for inside. "Universally Preferable Behaviour" supposed be authentic concept for five main reasons.

De first one na logical: If I argue say I nor agree with de tori wey say de proposition of say universally preferable behavior dey valid, I don already show sey I like truth pass falsehood, and I even like to correct people wey nor dey talk true – to talk sey e nor get anytin wey be universally preferable behavior be like to shout for person ear say sound nor dey exist – dis one sef dey contradict im sef . To put am anoda way , if  sometin like universally preferable behavior nor dey 
den make person oppose anybody wey yarn sey sometin like universally preferable behavior dey. Howeva if person do sometin de person don create universally preferable behavior. Dat one mean say universally preferable behavior or moral rules suppose dey valid.

Syllogistically, dis one mean sey:

1. De proposition na: de idea say "universally preferable behavior" suppose dey valid.
2. To dey argue sey universally preferable behavior nor dey valid, dey already demonstrate universally preferable behavior.
3. So derefore de argument on top say universally preferably behavior nor dey valid, nor fit dey vaild im sef.

All of us know sey objective preferences dey, like to love icecream or jazz song dem, wey nor fit affect oda people. For de oda hand e get oda preferences like rape and murder, wey go clearly affect oda people. preferences dey for logic too, truth plus including evidence, wey be say na also oda people wey e go affect. ( although nor be by violence e affect dem) as far as all of us accept say illogical proposition suppose be false or invalid. 


Dose preferences dem wey we fit consider as wetin fit affect oda people na "universal preferences" or "moral rules" we go call dem

which oda way we go take know say de idea of "moral rules" dey valid?

We fit examine dis question biologically and syllogistically too.

For instance all mata na subeject to physical rule – and also every living thing na subject to one kind requirement, and so if e dey alive e suppose don follow universally preferable behaviors. Life for instance need fuel and oxygen. all living mind dem na organic part of de world wey we dey see, and so dem be subject to pysical laws and dem suppose don follow universally preferable behaviors. To argue otherwise go need proof sey matter nor follow for wetin make up conciousness and e nor dey organic – e nor dey possible as e get mass, energy and life inside. To argue say consciousness nor be subject of physical rule or universally preferable behaviors go be like to argue say gravity nor dey affect human being and dem fit survive without food.

So e nor dey possible say anybody fit use logic argue universally preferable behaviour, since for dat person to dey alive dey argue, im go don follow universally preferred behaviors like to breath, to eat and to drink. 

Syllogistically, e mean say:

1. All things nid universally preferred behavior to live.
2. Man pikin na living thing
3. So all living men dey alive cos dem follow de universally preferred behavior
4. So any argument wey nor support universally preferred behaviour nid to accept and follow universally preferred behaviour.
5. So de argument wey nor support sey universally preferred behaviour behaviour dey exist nor dey valid.

Since de scientific method nid empirical support, we too suppose look reality to confirm wetin we think – and for here de fact say universally preferable behaviour dey valid get full support.

All man wey dey think well believe in one moral rule like that – some disagreement dey of wetin really dey inside moral rule but every body know say moral rule dey valid – just as many scientist don disagree but all scientist accept sey scientific method dey valid. Person fit argue say world round e nor flat – wey nor different from to change de meaning of wetin gud or bad – but person nor go fit argue say dis world nor dey exist at all – wey be like to argue say  e nor get anything like universally preferable behaviour.

Or:

1. For any scientific theory to dey valid, e must get support from empirical observation
2. If de idea of "universally preferable behavior" dey valid, den make man pikin believe universally preferable behavior.
3. All man believe universally preferable behaviour
4. Derefore empirical evidence dey exist to support say universally preferable behaviour dey valid – and as dis evidence dey exist, e dey oppose de proposition of say universally preferable behaviour nor dey valid.

De number four argument on top de validity of universally preferred behaviour dey empirical too. since human being get plenty choice to make for life, to say principles nor dey for universally preferable behaviour go be like to say all choice dey equal ( or make we say objective). Howeva all choices nor dey equal weda na with logic or empirical observation.

For instance, if food dey, everybody go like to dey eat every day. Wen weather cold all man go dey find where warm. Almost all papa and mama dem wan feed, shelter and send dia pikin go school. Many examples dey of common choices  wey man pikin dey make, wey show say universally preferable behaviour dey exist and na part of man pikin nature.

As we don yarn before, no physics theory wey valid go fit deny de simple fact say small pikin dem go fit catch fly-ball – na de same way, wey no ethics theory wey valid go fit reject de endless evidence wey we nid to accept UPB.

Or:

1. Choices dem dey almost infinite.
2. Many people dey make similar choices.
3. Derefore all choices nor fit dey equal.
4. Derefore choices wey everybody prefer suppose dey valid.

De number five argument of de validity of universally preferable behaviour dey evolutionary.

Since na all organic life need preferential behaviour to continue to live, we fit assume say de organism dem wey dey make de most successful choices na de once wey dey always survive.

Since man pikin na de most successful specie dem, and de most important organ wey man get na im mind, e go be say na man pikin mind wey don help to make all de successful choices dem. de mind sef don become successful cos of sey e fit make successful choices. Since our mind dey only exist cos of say we choose universally preferable behaviour, e mean say universally preferable behaviour go be sometin wey valid.

Or:

1. Living things dem dey succeed wen dem act on top universally preferable behaviour.
2. Man na de most successful living thing.
3. Derefore man go don show say im successful pass any oda thing cos of im follow universally preferable behaviour.
4. Man mind na de most important organ wey im get
5. Derefore man mind go don show say im dey most successful cos of sey im follow universally preferable behaviour.
6. Derefore universally preferable behaviour go dey valid.

We fit bring more argument to support say de validity of UPB dey exist, but we go match brake for de mata with wetin we don yarn already, and we go examine de nature of UPB.

#### UPB: Optional And Objective

Since we don prove say universally preferable behavior dey valid, de question of wetin gud or bad don shift. Since morality dey valid, na which theory  fit quantify, classify, explain and predict am?

First first make we nor forget say morality dey optional. All man na subject to gravity and all man nid food to live, but nor be must for man to behave well. If I rape, steal or kill, thunder nor go strike me. Moral rules dem just like scientific method and how biology dey classify things, na just ways to arrange fact wey relate to objective reality.

De fact say to comply with moral rule na optional, howeva, don confuse many people say morality sef dey subjective. Notin fit dey far from de truth.

Living organisms are part of material reality, and material reality is rational and objective. Applying moral theories is optional, but that does not mean that all moral theories are subjective. The scientific method is also optional, but it is not subjective. Applying biological classifications is optional, but biology is not subjective. Choices are optional; consequences are not. I can choose not to eat, but I cannot choose to live without eating. I can choose to behead someone, but I cannot choose whether or not they can live without a head. Morality is thus optional, but the *effects* of moral choices are measurable and objective.

Now, since morality is a valid concept, the next question is: to what degree or extent is morality valid?

As mentioned above, the first test of any scientific theory is *universality*. Just as a theory of physics must apply to *all* matter, a moral theory that claims to describe the preferable actions of mankind *must apply to **all** mankind*. No moral theory can be valid if it argues that a certain action is *right* in Syria, but *wrong* in San Francisco. It cannot say that Person A *must* do X, but Person B must *never* do X. It cannot say that what was *wrong* yesterday is *right* today – or vice versa. If it does, it is false and must be refined or discarded.

To be valid, any moral theory must also pass the criterion of *logical consistency*. Since the behaviour of matter is logical, consistent and predictable, all theories involving matter – either organic or inorganic – must also be logical, consistent and predictable. The theory of relativity cannot argue that the speed of light is both constant and not constant at the same time, or that it is one hundred eighty-six thousand kilometres per second, five kilometres in depth, and also green in colour.

However, since moral theories apply to mankind, and mankind is organic, the degree of *empirical* consistency required for moral theories is less than that required for *inorganic* theories. All rocks, for instance, must fall down, but not all horses have to be born with only one head. Biology includes three forms of “randomness,” which are environment, genetic mutation and free will. For example, poodles are generally friendly, but if beaten for years, will likely become aggressive. Horses are defined as having only one head, but occasionally, a two-headed mutant is born. Similarly, human beings generally prefer eating to starving – except anorexics. These exceptions do not bring down the entire science of biology. Thus, since moral theories describe mankind, they cannot be subjected to exactly the same requirements for consistency as theories describing inorganic matter.

The final test that any moral theory must pass is the criterion of empirical observation. For instance, a moral theory must explain the universal prevalence of moral beliefs among mankind, as well as the divergent results of human moral “experiments” such as fascism, communism, socialism or capitalism. It must also explain some basic facts about human society, such as the fact that state power always increases, or that propaganda tends to increase as state power increases. If it fails to explain the past, understand the present and predict the future, then it must be rejected as invalid.

#### UPB: The Practice

How does all this look in practice? Let’s look at how the requirement for *universality* affects moral theories. We shall touch here on proofs and disproofs for specific moral propositions, which we shall examine in more detail in Part Two.

If I say that gravity affects matter, it must affect *all* matter. If even one pebble proves immune to gravity, my theory is in trouble. If I propose a moral theory that argues that people should not murder, it must be applicable to *all* people. If certain people (such as soldiers) are exempt from that rule, then I have to either prove that soldiers are *not* people, or accept that my moral theory is false. There is no other possibility. On the other hand, if I propose a moral theory that argues that all people *should* murder, then I have saved certain soldiers, but condemned to evil all those *not* currently murdering someone (including those being murdered!) – which is surely incorrect.

If, to save the virtue of soldiers, I alter my theory to argue that it is moral for people to murder if someone else tells them to (a political leader, say), then I must deal with the problem of universality. If Politician A can order a soldier to murder an Iraqi, then the Iraqi must also be able to order the soldier to murder Politician A, and the soldier can also order Politician A to murder the Iraqi. The application of this theory results in a general and amoral paralysis, and thus is proven invalid.

I also cannot logically argue that is wrong for *some* people to murder, but right for *other* people to murder. Since all human beings share common physical properties and requirements, proposing one rule for one person and the *opposite* rule for another is invalid – it is like proposing a physics theory that says that some rocks fall down, while others fall up. Not only is it illogical, it contradicts an observable fact of reality, which is that human beings as a species share common characteristics, and so cannot be subjected to opposing rules. Biologists have no problems classifying certain organisms as “human” because they share common and easily identifiable characteristics – it is only moralists who seem to find this level of consistency impossible.

Furthermore, if my moral theory “proves” that the same man should not murder one day, but *should* murder the next day (say, when he steps out into the Iraqi desert), then my position is even more ludicrous. That would be equivalent to arguing that *one day a rock falls downward, and the next day it falls upward!* To call this any kind of consistent theory is to make madness sanity.

Since valid theories require *logical consistency*, a moral theory cannot be valid if it is both true and false at the same time. A moral theory that approves of stealing, for instance, faces an insurmountable logical problem. No moral theory should, if it is universally applied, directly eliminate behaviour it defines as moral while simultaneously creating behaviour it defines as *immoral*. If everyone *should* steal, then no one *will* steal – which means that the moral theory can never be practised. And *why* will no one steal? Well, because a man will only steal if he can *keep* the property he is stealing. He’s not going to bother stealing a wallet if someone else is going to immediately steal that wallet from him. Any moral theory proposing that “stealing is good” is also automatically invalid because it posits that property rights are both valid and invalid *at the same time*, and so fails the test of logical consistency. If I steal from you, I am saying that *your* property rights are invalid. However, I want to *keep* what I am stealing – and therefore I am saying that *my* property rights are valid. However, property rights cannot be both valid and invalid at the same time, and so this proposition itself must be invalid.

Similarly, any moral theory that advocates rape faces a similar contradiction. Rape can *never* be moral, since any principle that approves it automatically contradicts itself. If rape is justified on the principle that “taking pleasure is always good,” then such a principle immediately fails the test of logical consistency, since the rapist may be “taking pleasure,” but his victim certainly is *not*.[^7]

Thus subjecting moral theories to the scientific method produces results that conform to rationality, empirical observations and plain common sense. Murder, theft, arson, rape and assault are all proven immoral.[^8]

To aid in swallowing this rather large conceptual pill, below is a table that helps equate theories of physics and biology with scientific theories of universally preferable (or moral) behaviour:

Table: Theories of physics and biology and of UPB

In conclusion, it is safe to say that (a) moral rules are valid, and (b) moral theories must be subjected to the rigours of logic and evidence, just as theories of physics and biology are. Any moral theory based on non-universal or self-contradictory principles is demonstrably false.

#### UPB: The Framework

UPB can thus be seen as a framework for validating ethical theories or propositions – just as the scientific method is a framework that is used to validate scientific theories or propositions.

An example of a moral proposition is: “the initiation of the use of force is wrong.” UPB is the methodology that tests that proposition against both internal consistency and empirical observation. UPB thus first asks: *is the proposition logical and consistent?* UPB then asks: *what evidence exists for the truth of the proposition?*

To keep this book at a reasonable length, we will in general deal mostly with the first criterion of logical consistency. For the second criterion, we shall rely for evidence on the universal prohibitions across all cultures against certain actions such as rape, theft, assault and murder. Much more could be written on the historical evidence that helps support or reject various moral propositions, but we shall leave that for another time. If we establish the validity of UPB, we have achieved an enormous amount. If we do not, evidence will scarcely help us.

Let us now turn to the question of whether the UPB framework deals with matters of *ethics*, or *aesthetics*, or both.

[^7]: The same goes, of course, for murder and assault. We will be returning to these proofs – as well as a further examination of property rights – in more detail in Part Two of this book.

[^8]: Universal and positive moral rules can also be proven – i.e. the universal validity of property rights and non-violence – but we shall discuss that in Part Two.
