### Five Proofs wey UPB get:

As we don discuss before, de proposition of say e nor get anytin wey be preferable behavior get plenty logical and empirical problem for inside. "Universally Preferable Behaviour" supposed be authentic concept for five main reasons.

De first one na logical: If I argue say I nor agree with de tori wey say de proposition of say universally preferable behavior dey valid, I don already show sey I like truth pass falsehood, and I even like to correct people wey nor dey talk true – to talk sey e nor get anytin wey be universally preferable behavior be like to shout for person ear say sound nor dey exist – dis one sef dey contradict im sef . To put am anoda way , if  sometin like universally preferable behavior nor dey 
den make person oppose anybody wey yarn sey sometin like universally preferable behavior dey. Howeva if person do sometin de person don create universally preferable behavior. Dat one mean say universally preferable behavior or moral rules suppose dey valid.

Syllogistically, dis one mean sey:

1. De proposition na: de idea say "universally preferable behavior" suppose dey valid.
2. To dey argue sey universally preferable behavior nor dey valid, dey already demonstrate universally preferable behavior.
3. So derefore de argument on top say universally preferably behavior nor dey valid, nor fit dey vaild im sef.

All of us know sey objective preferences dey, like to love icecream or jazz song dem, wey nor fit affect oda people. For de oda hand e get oda preferences like rape and murder, wey go clearly affect oda people. preferences dey for logic too, truth plus including evidence, wey be say na also oda people wey e go affect. ( although nor be by violence e affect dem) as far as all of us accept say illogical proposition suppose be false or invalid. 


Dose preferences dem wey we fit consider as wetin fit affect oda people na "universal preferences" or "moral rules" we go call dem

which oda way we go take know say de idea of "moral rules" dey valid?

We fit examine dis question biologically and syllogistically too.

For instance all mata na subeject to physical rule – and also every living thing na subject to one kind requirement, and so if e dey alive e suppose don follow universally preferable behaviors. Life for instance need fuel and oxygen. all living mind dem na organic part of de world wey we dey see, and so dem be subject to pysical laws and dem suppose don follow universally preferable behaviors. To argue otherwise go need proof sey matter nor follow for wetin make up conciousness and e nor dey organic – e nor dey possible as e get mass, energy and life inside. To argue say consciousness nor be subject of physical rule or universally preferable behaviors go be like to argue say gravity nor dey affect human being and dem fit survive without food.

So e nor dey possible say anybody fit use logic argue universally preferable behaviour, since for dat person to dey alive dey argue, im go don follow universally preferred behaviors like to breath, to eat and to drink. 

Syllogistically, e mean say:

1. All things nid universally preferred behavior to live.
2. Man pikin na living thing
3. So all living men dey alive cos dem follow de universally preferred behavior
4. So any argument wey nor support universally preferred behaviour nid to accept and follow universally preferred behaviour.
5. So de argument wey nor support sey universally preferred behaviour behaviour dey exist nor dey valid.

Since de scientific method nid empirical support, we too suppose look reality to confirm wetin we think – and for here de fact say universally preferable behaviour dey valid get full support.

All man wey dey think well believe in one moral rule like that – some disagreement dey of wetin really dey inside moral rule but every body know say moral rule dey valid – just as many scientist don disagree but all scientist accept sey scientific method dey valid. Person fit argue say world round e nor flat – wey nor different from to change de meaning of wetin gud or bad – but person nor go fit argue say dis world nor dey exist at all – wey be like to argue say  e nor get anything like universally preferable behaviour.

Or:

1. For any scientific theory to dey valid, e must get support from empirical observation
2. If de idea of "universally preferable behavior" dey valid, den make man pikin believe universally preferable behavior.
3. All man believe universally preferable behaviour
4. Derefore empirical evidence dey exist to support say universally preferable behaviour dey valid – and as dis evidence dey exist, e dey oppose de proposition of say universally preferable behaviour nor dey valid.

De number four argument on top de validity of universally preferred behaviour dey empirical too. since human being get plenty choice to make for life, to say principles nor dey for universally preferable behaviour go be like to say all choice dey equal ( or make we say objective). Howeva all choices nor dey equal weda na with logic or empirical observation.

For instance, if food dey, everybody go like to dey eat every day. Wen weather cold all man go dey find where warm. Almost all papa and mama dem wan feed, shelter and send dia pikin go school. Many examples dey of common choices  wey man pikin dey make, wey show say universally preferable behaviour dey exist and na part of man pikin nature.

As we don yarn before, no physics theory wey valid go fit deny de simple fact say small pikin dem go fit catch fly-ball – na de same way, wey no ethics theory wey valid go fit reject de endless evidence wey we nid to accept UPB.

Or:

1. Choices dem dey almost infinite.
2. Many people dey make similar choices.
3. Derefore all choices nor fit dey equal.
4. Derefore choices wey everybody prefer suppose dey valid.

De number five argument of de validity of universally preferable behaviour dey evolutionary.

Since na all organic life need preferential behaviour to continue to live, we fit assume say de organism dem wey dey make de most successful choices na de once wey dey always survive.

Since man pikin na de most successful specie dem, and de most important organ wey man get na im mind, e go be say na man pikin mind wey don help to make all de successful choices dem. de mind sef don become successful cos of sey e fit make successful choices. Since our mind dey only exist cos of say we choose universally preferable behaviour, e mean say universally preferable behaviour go be sometin wey valid.

Or:

1. Living things dem dey succeed wen dem act on top universally preferable behaviour.
2. Man na de most successful living thing.
3. Derefore man go don show say im successful pass any oda thing cos of im follow universally preferable behaviour.
4. Man mind na de most important organ wey im get
5. Derefore man mind go don show say im dey most successful cos of sey im follow universally preferable behaviour.
6. Derefore universally preferable behaviour go dey valid.

We fit bring more argument to support say de validity of UPB dey exist, but we go match brake for de mata with wetin we don yarn already, and we go examine de nature of UPB.

#### UPB: Optional And Objective

Since we don prove say universally preferable behavior dey valid, de question of wetin gud or bad don shift. Since morality dey valid, na which theory  fit quantify, classify, explain and predict am?

First first make we nor forget say morality dey optional. All man na subject to gravity and all man nid food to live, but nor be must for man to behave well. If I rape, steal or kill, thunder nor go strike me. Moral rules dem just like scientific method and how biology dey classify things, na just ways to arrange fact wey relate to objective reality.

De fact say to comply with moral rule na optional, howeva, don confuse many people say morality sef dey subjective. Notin fit dey far from de truth.

Living thing dem na part of material reality, and material reality dey rational and objective. e dey optional to apply moral theory, but dat one nor mean say all moral theory dey subjective. De scientific method dey optional too but e nor dey subjective. Choices dey optional but de consequences dem nor dey optional. I fit decide say I nor go eat but I nor fit decide say I fit survive without food. I fit decide to cut person head but I nor fit decide weda dem fit survive without head. And so morality dey optional, but we go fit measure the effect dem of moral choices and dem dey objective.

As we don see say morality na concept wey valid. De next question go be: na how morality valid reach?

As we don yarn before, the first test wey any scientific theory go pass through na how everybody see am. Just as na every matter wey theory of physic must apply to, any theory wey say im dey talk about wetin man pikin like must apply to every man. e nor get any moral theory wey go fit dey valid if im argue say some kind waka gud for Syria but e nor gud for San Francisco. Dem nor fit say man A must do X but make man B nor do X. Dem nor fit say wetin bad yesterday go turn good today - or de oda way. If dem talk so, den na false and dem must change dat kind tori or dem trowey am.

For any moral theory to dey valid, e must get  logical consistency. Since de way matter dey behave dey logical, e dey consistent and we fit predict am. All the theory dem wey involve matter – weda na organic or inorganic – must dey logical, consistent and sometim wey we fit predict. De theory wey talk about how things dey relate nor fit argue say de speed wey light get go fit dey constant and e nor got fit dey constant de same time, or na one hundred and eighty six thousand kilometers e dey waka per second, and e be five kilometers for depth and na green colour.

Howeva, since moral theory dem apply to man pikin and man pikin dey organic, we nor need too much empirical consistency for moral theory as we need for inorganic theory dem. All rocks dem go fall one day but nor be all horses must come dis world with only one head. Biology get three ways way things fit happen, wey be  environment, genetic mutation and free will. For example poodle na generally friendly dog dem be, but if you maltreat dem for plenty years dem to turn aggressive. we know say horse suppose get only one head, but some times horse dey born pikin wey get two head. Na so wey man prefer to eat dan make im die of hunger – except those people wey dey fear to add weight. De exception sha nor spoil de whole science of biology. Since moral theory dey talk about man pikin, we nor fit dey look for de same amount of consistency inside every man, just like theory wey dey talk about inorganic matter.

De last test wey any moral theory go pass through na weda im get empirical observation. For instance moral theory must to explain how everybody for everywhere dey see wetin good or bad, and de result of d experiment of man morals wey nor blend,  wey be fascism, communism, socialism or capitalism. e must explain some fact about human society just like de fact wey say state power dey always increase, or say propaganda go always increase wen state power increase. If e come fail to explain de fact den understand de present and come predict de future, de we must reject am say e nor dey valid.

#### UPB: De Practice

Na how all dis one go look like for practice ? make we see how de  requirement for universality dey affect moral theory dem.
For here we go talk about proof and disproof for some type of moral proposition dem, wey we go examine wella for part two.

If I talk say gravity dey affect matter, na all matter e go affect. If e come be say gravity affect everytin remain one small stone, dat one mean say my theory dey for trouble. If I propose one theory like dat wey dey argue say make people nor kill, na all people dis one suppose apply to. If e be say dis one come exempt some people (like soldiers), dat one mean say I go nid prove say soldiers nor be people or agree say my moral theory dey wrong. Anoda way nor dey. For de oda hand if I propose one moral theory wey argue say make people kill, den I don save some soldiers but I don turn people wey nor dey kill to bad people too (even dose people wey dem go kill) – and dis one nor correct at all.

If, I wan save de virtue of soldiers dem, I come change my theory say e dey gud make people dey kill if  anoda person (like politician) tell dem to, den I go nid to deal with de problem of how everybody see dis one. If politician A fit order say make soldier kill people from Iraq, den Iraq people suppose fit order soldiers to kill politician A, and de soldiers too go fit order politician to kill Iraq people. If we apply dis theory e go cause amoral paralysis and so dis one don cast.

I nor fit argue say na bad thing for some people to kill, but e gud for oda people to kill. Since na all man dey share de same physical property and requirement dem, to propose one rule for one person and de opposite rule for anoda person nor make sense – e be like to propose physics rule wey say some rocks dey fall down and oda rocks dey fall go up. e nor only dey illogical but e dey contradict wetin we know already, wey be say man pikin as species dey share de same characteristics, and so dem nor fit follow two different rules. e easy for biology to say sometin na human being cos dem share de same characteristic with man pikin – na only moralist wey dey see dis level of consistency as sometin wey nor fit happen.

As d tori dey go, if moral theory prove say make one man nor kill one day but make im kill de next day (like when im enter desert for Iraq) den my position nor make sense at all. Dat one na like de same thing to dey argue say one day rock to fall down but de next day e go fall go up! To even call dis one any type of consistent theory  na to make craze turn sense.

Since na logical consistency wey valid theory need, one moral theory nor fit dey valid if e na true and na lie de same time. Moral theory wey say to steal gud , for instance, dey face big problem. Make no moral theory wen everybody use am, condemn one behaviour wey e talk say dey gud and den come bring anoda one wey e don talk say dey bad de same time. If everybody suppose steal den no body go steal – No body go practice dis one. And why person nor go steal? well, na cos man nor go steal wetin im nor go  fit keep. Man nor go waste time steal wallet if im know say anoda man go nab am from im hand. Any moral theory wey say to "steal na gud thing" don cast automatically cos e dey yarn say property rights dey valid and e nor dey valid de same time, and so im don fail de test of logical consistency. If I steal your thing I dey try tell you say your property right nor dey invalid. But I wan keep wetin I steal – and so I dey say my property right dey valid. 
Howeva propery rights nor fit dey valid and invalid de same time and so de proposition sef nor dey valid.

Na so wey any moral theory wey support say rape na gud thing go face de same contradiction. Rape no fit ever be gud thing, since wey any principle wey approve am go dey contradict im sef. If dem come justify rape say cos "e gud to always take pleasure" den dat kind principle don fail de test of logical consistency, since na only de rapist go dey take pleasure but im victim go dey suffer.[^7]

And so to dey subject moral theory dem make dem follow scientific method go dey produce bring result wey agree with rationality, empirical observation and ordinary common sense. we don prove say murder, theft, arson, rape and assault na bad things.

To help us swallow dis big conceptual tablet, you go see table for down wey go help us make theories of physics and biology become equal with scientific theory dem of universally preferable (or moral) behaviour:

Table: Physics And biology And UPB Theory Dem

To conclude de mata, e dey safe to talk say (a) Rules of gud and bad dey valid, and (b) Dem must put moral theory dem under the conditions  logic and evidence wey nor easy.just as theories of physics and biology dem dey. And e dey show say any moral theory wey base on non-universal or sef-contradictory principles dey false.

#### UPB: De Framework

We fit see UPB as framework wey we go use validate ethical theory or proposition dem – just as scientific method na framework dem dey use validate scientific theory or proposition dem.

One exmaple of moral proposition na: "say to use force nor gud". UPB na de methodology wey dey test  dat  proposition against internal consistency and empirical observation. So UPB dey frist ask: *weda de proposition dey logical or consistent ?* then UPB dey ask: which evidence dey wey we go take sabi de truth of de proposition.

To make sure say dis book nor long too much, we go generally deal with de first thing wey logical consistency need. For de second thing, we go nid to rely for de evidence on top de universal prohibition dem for every culture  wey nor support some kind actions like rape, theft, assault and murder. We fit write more things about some evidence from history wey dey help to support or reject various moral proposition, but we go leave dat tori for anoda time. If we come establish say UPB dey valid, we don achieve so much. But if we nor do am, evidence nor go fit help us.

Make we turn to de question wey dey ask weda  de UPB framework dey deal with *ethic* mata or *aesthetics* mata abi na both.

[^7]: Na de same thing for murder and assault. We go return to de proof dem –we go do more torch lighting on top property rights – for de Part Two of dis book.

[^8]: We go fit prove Universal and positive moral rules too – as in, de universal validity of property rights and nonviolence – but we go discuss dat one for de Part Two
