## Fraud Na The Number Four Test

Na for de edge of wetin everybody see as ethical wey de problem of fraud tanda.

Fraud na wen person use wayo collect sometin. If I tell you say I go ship ipod for you if you give me two hundred dollars, den afta I take your money and I nor ship de ipod for you, we understand say dis one dey in form of theft.

Make we use UPB torchlight dis fraud mata, to see wetin we go find.

E clear sey fraud nid more dan one person to happen. For that business wey me and you do before, If I dey hope to nab your two hundred dollars and you sef dey hope to steal my ipod, notin go come out. You go ask for de ipod before you give me money, and I go ask for the money too before I give you the ipod. we go just dey dia and none of us, go fit fraud each oda.

e clear say na one person suppose act in gud faith for make fraud happen. So for de plan to work well, de person now wey wan play 419 go get hope for mata wey be say de oda person nor wish to play am 419.

make we talk about our unlucky guinea pig wey sabi gud and bad. Wetin go happen if we say make dem act on moral principle say "Fraud na gud thing" If Doug get twenty dollars and Bob get lighter, and Doug say im go pay twenty dollars for Bob lighter, but afta im take de lighter, bob nor see de money, dat one mean say Doug see fraud as gud thing.

Wetin go come happen ?

e clear say Doug and Bob nor fit act on top de principle wey be say "fraud na gud thing" de same time – since for make fraud happen Doug must do wayo but Bob must dey honest. So for make Doug do gud, Bob must do bad”.

UPB don block road so that dis one nor go fit happen, since e nor get any theory of gud and bad wey require two actions wey nor blend with each oda to happen unda de same mata.

If Doug play Bob 419, den come try to defend imsef say na gud thing to use lie get wetin you want. den e clear say e gud make person dey honest too. since e nor dey possible to use lie get wetin you want unless oda people think say na true you dey talk. So de tori way say e gud to use lie get wetin you want go cast unless oda people sef choose to dey honest.

Dis na how we take know say fraud nor gud.

Again, as we know say fraud nor gud, e mean say we don already know say any tori wey yarn say fraud gud nor dey valid, cos the tori dey contradict im sef. If we build bridge and de bring come scatter, we go know sey de bridge been no gud. but de important thing wey we fit learn from dis mata nor be say de bridge scatter, but na  to understand de mistake wey dey inside de theory wey make us build bridge wey come scatter later. na so wey e dey important for us to evaluate de theory of gud and bad, wey dey cause wahala like communism, Fascism and Nazism as dem relate with UPB, nor be so dat we go only understand how dem carry spoil but how we sef go carry arrange our own moral theory make e beta for future. Since as we dey so, we go continue to build bridge, e beta make we get out facts and theory well, if not na so de bridge dem go continue to fall.

Howeva, de question wey everybody dey ask na weda  fraud na bad thing, or just aesthetically negative action (ANA)..

Fraud nor be like rape, theft and murder. As fas as sey e require de victim go act positively to follow for de process. If come strangle you from behind, you nor need to play any part inside, but I nor fit fraud you unless you participate somehow. So fraud dey unda de umbrella of avoidability, so im with rape, murder and theft nor dey for de same category. howeva de na how you fit avoid am reach wey determine de amount of immorality wey dey inside.
you fit avoid to send your bank details to 
Nigerian email spammer. for dem to cheat you eBay business wey get beta rating dey hard to avoid.

e get times wey nor go fit avoid fraud, like " to dey batter for life saving medicine wey nor get alternative"but dat one dey under "de areas wey grey" wey we don discuss before – dis occurrence dey hardly happen, so to ethics dem be like as mutations be to living things.
