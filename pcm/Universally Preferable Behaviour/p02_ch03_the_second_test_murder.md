## The Second Test: Murder
## The Next thing we go test now, na murder
## The Second Test: Murder

Let us now test the UPB framework against moral propositions regarding *murder*, which here is defined as killing intentionally and with premeditation, not in self-defence.

Make we test this UPB framework with the idea of murder, wey we say na intentional killing no be mistake or self defense


Since we spent so much time dissecting the question of rape – and since many of the same arguments will apply here – this analysis can be much briefer.

Since we don spend plenty time to argue this rape matter and since the argument go still continue here. This our study go dey brief.

Let us return to our two moral guinea pigs sitting in a room – we’ll call them Bob and Doug.

Make we return to our two innocent guinea pig wey sidon for inside one room. We go call them Bog and Doug.

If murder is morally good, then clearly *refraining* from murder is immoral. Thus the only chance that Bob and Doug have to be moral is in the instant that they simultaneously murder each other. Physically, this is impossible of course – if they both stand and grip each other’s throats, they will never succumb to strangulation at exactly the same moment. If Bob dies first, his grip on Doug’s throat will loosen, thus condemning Doug to the status of *immorality* until such time as he can find another victim. Because Bob dies first – and thus cannot continue to try murdering Doug – Bob’s death renders him more immoral than Doug’s murder.

If murder na good thing, na him be sey refraining na bad thing. That one means sey the only chance wey Bob and Doug get to prove sey them good na to kill each other. For real life, that one no fit happen because if the two of them stand come hold each other for throat, them no go succeed kill each other the same time. If bob first die, him hand go comot for Doug throat. And so Doug go become bad person until the time when Doug go find who to kill again. And because na Bob first die, him no go fit kill Doug ever again. That one go come mean sey Bob bad well well, pass Doug


Intuitively, we fully recognise the insanity of the moral proposition that murder is good. Logically, we know that the proposition is incorrect because if it is true, it is impossible for two men in a room to both be moral at the same time. Morality, like health, cannot be considered a mere “snapshot”, but must be a process, or a continuum. The UPB framework confirms that Bob cannot be “evil” *while* he is strangling Doug, and then achieve the pinnacle of moral virtue the moment that he kills Doug – and then revert immediately back to a state of evil. Moral propositions must be universal, and independent of time and place. The proposition that murder is moral fails this requirement at every level, and so is not valid.

With common sense we know sey na madness to think sey killing na good thing. Even based on logic, wey be say na correct talk, we know sey this thinking dey wrong. Because if na true, e go dey impossible for two men for inside one room to behave well the same time.
Good behavior like strong body no fit be like snapshot. E suppose be continuous process. This UPB dey let us know sey Bob no fit be bad person when him try to kill Doug, then turn to good when him finally kill Doug then go back to him bad self immediately.
Good behavior suppose be as everybody think am, the time and the place no matter. The suggestion wey say murder good, no correspond with wetin everybody think and that one mean sey e dey wrong.


If murder were morally good, then it would also be the case that a man stranded on a desert island would be morally evil for as long as he lived there, since he would have no victims to kill. A man in a coma would also be evil, as would a sleeping man, or a man on the operating table. A torturer would be an evil man as long as he continued to torture – but then would become a good man in the moment that his victim died at his hand.

If murder na good behavior, then e mean sey person wey dey for desert na bad person. Since that person no get who to kill all those time. Even person wey dey for coma na evil person, and person wey dey sleep, or person wey go for operation. Person wey dey torture people go be bad person if him continue to torture people, but he go turn good immediately him victim die cos of the torture.


We can thus see that the proposition that “murder is good” is not only instinctively bizarre, but also logically impossible.

We don see say the suggestion wey tok say "murder na good thing" no only dey strange, but e no make sense too.


The other objections that applied to the proposition “rape is good” also apply here. Murder cannot be morally neutral, since morally neutral judgements or actions cannot be forcibly inflicted upon another, and murder by definition is forcibly inflicted upon another.

The other argument wey no gree say "rape na good thing" follow for here too. Murder no fit dey between good and bad, since na person go use him hand choose weda him want the things wey dey between good and bad, but murder means sey the person no get choice.


There is also a basic contradiction involved in any universal justification for the act of murder, just as there was in the act of rape. If Bob tries to strangle Doug, but Doug resists, how could Bob rationally justify his actions according to UPB?

wahala go always dey for where people agree say murder na good thing, just as e been dey with rape. UPB say If Doug been fight when Bob try to kill am, how Bob for take argue sey wetin him do dey good.



Well, he could say something like: “a man’s life can be taken any time you want to” – but of course, since UPB is the only valid test of moral propositions, this justifies Doug killing Bob as much as it does Bob killing Doug. Thus Bob can only justify strangling Doug if Doug does not resist in any way – but of course if Doug does not resist, then can it really be considered murder?

maybe Bob for talk sey: "You fit kill person any time you want"  but since na only UPB be the correct test for good or bad behavior.  e mean say neither Bob or Doug dey guilty  if them kill each other. So Bob fit say for him to kill Doug no be bad thing if Doug agree, But true true if Doug agree, we fit tok say that one na murder ?



* Let us say that Bob then adjusts his premise to say: “I can shoot a man in his sleep any time I want”. The problem here is not only the sleep that Bob will lose based on his universal premise, but also the logical impossibility of reversing moral propositions based on the differences in the states of sleeping and waking. Biologically speaking, a man does not become the *opposite* of a man when he falls asleep, any more than gravity reverses when he blinks.

make we say Bob try to defend himself come say " Any time wey I want, I fit shoot anybody wen dem dey sleep". The problem here no be the sleep wey Bob miss, but na say the matter no dey reasonable to say na good thing to kill person when the person dey sleep. Murder na bad thing weda the person dey sleep or awake. If we wan talk Biology, man no fit change when him sleep, just as gravity no fit reverse when him blink.



Since a man remains a man when he falls asleep, it cannot be the case that opposite moral rules apply to him in this state. Thus to say that it is immoral to murder a man when he is awake, but it is moral to murder a him when he is asleep, is to create a logical contradiction unsupported by any objective biological facts. A physicist may say that a rock falls down, but a helium balloon rises up – but that is because a rock and a helium balloon have fundamentally different properties. No credible physicist can say that one rock falls down, but that another rock with almost exactly the same qualities falls up. The same is true for moral theories – no credible philosopher can say that morality reverses itself when a man is asleep, since a man’s nature does not fundamentally alter when he naps.

Since person na still person even when e dey sleep, e no fit happen sey things wey dey bad, to change to good because him dey sleep. So to say killing when person dey awake dey bad but e good to kill am when him sleep no concur with important biological facts.
Person way dey study physics go say na down rock dey fall but helium balloon dey rise up, this na because rock and helium get different property inside them. Na only quack physicist go say one rock go fall down but another rock like am go fall go up. Na the same thing for moral matter - No better philosopher go tell you say morality go change by himself when man dey sleep. Since man nature no fit just change like that wen him dey sleep. 




* In this way, if we cannot justly shoot a man when he is awake, we also cannot shoot him when he is asleep, since he is still a man.

As e be so, if we no fit shoot person wey dey awake , we no fit shoot am when e don sleep, since na still person e be.

* Thus, since the statement “I can shoot a man in his sleep any time I want” cannot be validated according to UPB, it cannot be a true moral proposition.

UPB no fit count the tori wey say ''when person dey sleep I fit shoot am anytime I want" as tori wey make sense, them no fit call am good behavior.


* Here again we find that the UPB framework holds true in terms of murder. The only possible valid moral theory regarding murder is that it is evil, or universally banned.

For here too we see say the UPB framework  na true for murder matter. The only theory wey make sense about murder, na say the thing na evil and them don ban am for everywhere.

We could take the same approach to the question of assault, but the arguments would be identical to those of rape and murder, so for the sake of brevity, we shall continue.

We fit treat the matter of assault the same way, but the argument no go dey different from the one of rape and kiling.
This na just briefing, so make we continue.

* Let us now turn to the question of theft. If this framework holds true here as well, then we have hit the perfect trifecta of our instinctual moral understanding, and found rational confirmation for our existing beliefs. We have discovered the maths that explains how we are able to instinctively catch a ball, and that is a necessary start.

Make we face the question of robbing now. If the framework come be true for here too, that one mean sey we don reach the better trifecta of the understanding wey we get about moral.
we don also find correct proof for the belief wey we get now.
We don find out the mathematics wey explain how we fit catch ball and that one na the type of start wey we need.


## Self-Defence?
## Self Defence ?

We have skirted over the issue of self-defence with regards to murder, though it is scarcely necessary to examine it in the case of rape. This is not because the issue of self-defence is either self-evident or uncomplicated, but rather because the complications that exist can be dealt with more comprehensively after we look at the question of theft.

we don discuss this self defense matter as e concern murder, but e nor too necessary to examine am for rape matter. This one no be because na only the person fit prove sey na self defense but na because the we go fit solve the wahala wey dey inside, only after we look the theft issue.
