## The Third Test: Theft
## Theft Na The Third Test


We will have to spend a little bit more time on theft, since it inevitably brings into the picture the question of property rights, which is highly contentious for some.

We go nid to spend extra time for this robbery matter, cos e dey always bring tori wey concern ownership and some people dey see dis one as wahala  tori.


There are many ways of approaching the question of property rights, from “homesteading” to legal definitions to practical considerations etc. I will address none of those here, because the question of property rights must fall into the framework of UPB, if UPB is to stand as a rational methodology for evaluating moral propositions.

E get many ways wey we fit look into dis ownership matter,  homesteading na one of them, and by some kind legit explanation and consideration. I no go address them here cos property rights suppose blend with the framework of UPB. if UPB now, go stand as one better way to know how we suppose behave.

Clearly, the moral proposition with regard to property rights is this: either human beings have the right to own property, or they do not.

e don clear sey the behavior we suppose show to ownership matter, na sey  human being either get right to own property or dem no get.


Now the first “property” that must be dealt with is the body. “Ownership” must first and foremost consist of control over one’s own body, because if that control does not exist, or is not considered valid, then the whole question of morality – let alone property – goes out the window.

The first thing wey we go look into na our body. Ownership suppose start with the how people dey control their owl body. Because if them no fit control their self or them no think sey na important thing to control their self. Then the whole tori  about good behavior or even property no dey important.

UPB is a framework for evaluating moral propositions, or arguments about universally preferable behaviour for all mankind. First and foremost, a man must be responsible for his own actions if they are to be judged morally, since as we have argued above, the capacity to choose actions is fundamental to any ethical evaluation.

UPB na system wey dem dey use measure how people dey behave or those behavior wey everybody agree with. Man  must take responsibility for the things wey him do first, before person fit say him do good or bad. Cos as we don talk before, the power to choose how we go behave  dey very important.

If a man has no control over his body, then clearly he has no responsibility for his actions – they are not in fact “his” actions, but rather the actions of his body. Now, no one would rationally argue that if a man strangles another man, it is the murderous fingers that should be put on trial and punished. Clearly, the body cannot entirely control itself, but rather must be to some degree under the direction of the conscious mind.

If man no fit control him self, then we no fit blame am for the things him do. Instead na him body we go blame. Now no body go argue sey if one man press another man neck and the other man die, na the finger wey the man use suppose go prison. As we see am body no fit move alone, na man dey control him body.

What this means is that a man is responsible for the actions of his body, and therefore he is responsible for the effects of those actions. A man is responsible for where he puts his penis, which is how we know that we can judge him for raping someone. He “owns” the actions of his body as surely as he owns his body. To say that a man is responsible for his body but not the effects of his body is to argue that a man is responsible for aiming and throwing a knife, but not for where it lands.

Wetin this one mean be sey na man dey responsible for the things wey him body do and the result of those things. Man dey responsible for where him prick enter, na so we fit talk sey him don rape person. Na him get him body and we fit blame am for the things wey him body dey do. To sey man get him body but we no fit blame man for wetin him body do, be like to say where knife enter, no be the fault of  who throw the knife.

Also, arguing that a man is not responsible for the effects of his body is a self-detonating statement, similar to the ones we examined above. If I say to you: “Men are not responsible for the actions of their bodies”, it would be eminently fair for you to ask me who is working my vocal chords and mouth. If I say that I have no control over my speech – which is an effect of the body – then I have “sustained” my thesis at the cost of invalidating it completely.

And so, we go look like we no get sense to dey argue say we no fit blame man for the result of wetin him body do. If I tell you say make we no blame man for wetin him body do. then e go make sense if you ask me say na wetin dey control my voice and my mouth. If I tell you say no be me dey control my mouth, wey be part of my body. then I go win the argument but I go don use my hand spoil wetin I dey argue.


If I am not at all responsible for my speech, then there is no point arguing with me. A tape recorder is also not responsible for its speech, which is why we tend not to get into virulent disagreements with magnetic strips. In cheesy horror films, young girls seem to be particularly susceptible to demonic possession – the inevitable priest who shows up always offers to talk to the demon in charge of the girl, at which point the girl starts making a sound like Don Ho gargling with ball bearings.

e go dey useless to argue with me, If I no dey responsible for the things way I talk. We no fit argue with tape record cos we no fit blame am for wetin e talk. For horror film na young girls way demon dey like to enter, and when them call pastor, the pastor dey always ask to talk with the demon way dey inside the girl na that time way the girl go start to make noise like person way dey wash mouth with bearings.

This ridiculous portrait is accurate in one sense though – if some other being is in full control of the girl’s vocal chords, it is that being which needs to be addressed, not the girl, who has no control over her responses.

As this thing funny like this, na only one place e fit make sense sha,  if another person dey control the girl mouth, na that person way the pastor suppose talk to instead of the girl, wey no know wetin she dey do.

Thus if I say to you that I do not have control over my speech, you can ask me: who does? If I reply that no one does, then it makes about as much sense to argue with me as it does to argue with a television set, or the aforementioned boulder as it bounces down a hillside towards you car.


So if I tell you say no be me dey control my mouth, then you go ask me who dey control am then. If tell you say nobody dey control am, then to argue with me go be like to argue with television, or the rock wey talk before, as e dey roll come where your mottor dey.


Thus the very act of controlling my body to produce speech demands the acceptance of my ability to control my speech – an implicit affirmation of my ownership over my own body.

So to control my mouth to talk I need to agree say na me dey control my mouth. This one show say na get ownership of my body.

Now, if demonic possession were a valid occurrence, and a girl possessed by a demon spat on a priest, we would not call the girl rude, but would rather pity her for being inhabited by such an impolite demon. Whoever has control over the girl’s body is culpable for the effects of her actions – this is why we would not call a man who stole while sleepwalking “evil”, since he did not have full control over his own body (although we may restrain him in other ways). This is also the basis for the legal defence of “not guilty by reason of insanity”, which is that we assume that a man who is insane does not have full control over his actions.

Now if demon dey enter person for real life, and girl we demon dey inside come pour the pastor spit. we no go talk say the girl no get respect but we go pity her cos the demon inside her dey wicked.
Na who dey control the girl body wey we go blame for wetin the girl dey do.
Na why we no go say man wey thief something as him they waka for him sleep na bad man. cos him no fit control him self when him dey sleep. This one na why dem set up Legal Defense of say,  person no fit dey guilty if the person don kolo. We assume say person wey kolo no go fit control himself.

Thus to reject the ownership of the body is to reject all morality, which, as we have seen above, is utterly impossible. Logically, since morality is defined as an enforceable subset of UPB, to reject morality is to say that it is universally preferable to believe that there is no such thing as universal preferences.

So to agree say no be person get him body, na to like to say the way we behave no matter, wey as we don see for up no dey possible at all.
Since morality na one of the things wey make up UPB, to say morality no follow na like to say e no got something wet everybody agree with.


Finally, to use one’s ownership of one’s own body in the form of speech to reject the notion that one can control one’s own body, is a blatant and insurmountable self-contradiction.

Last last, to control your mouth to talk say no be person dey control him body, just be like say you dey argue with yourself.

It is in this way that any rejection of self-ownership can be utterly discarded.

Na like this wey we fit cancel the tori wey talk say no body get ownership of their own body

Since we own our bodies, we also inevitably own the effects of our actions, be they good or bad. If we own the effects of our actions, then clearly we own that which we produce, whether what we produce is a bow, or a book – or a murder.

Cos na we get our body, na we also get get the result of wetin our body do whether na good or bad. If the result of wetin our body do na our own, na him be say na we get wetin we make, whether a arrow, or na book or na murder.

## Property And UPB

## Property And UPB

Even if we reject the above, we can still use UPB to definitively assert the existence of universal property rights.

Even if we no agree with wetin dey up, we fit still use UPB to show sey everybody get  right to own property.

As mentioned above, either human beings have property rights, or they do not. Except for a few grey areas, which we will get to shortly, this remains a universal proposition.

As we talk for before, na either person get right to own property or him no get any right.  This one na wetin everybody believe, except for some areas wey we go talk about soon.

If a man does not have the right to use property, then he does not have the right to use his own body. He does not have the right to use his own lungs, and therefore must stop breathing. Although this sounds silly, it is an immediate and inevitable result of the premise that human beings do not have property rights.

If one man no get right to own property, then him no get right to use him own body. Him go get right to use him lungs, so him suppose breath. Even though this one no make sense, na the same thing wey we mean when we say man no fit own property.



E nor go cos wahala to think say any body wey dey argue property rights with you dey breath, and so the person don already agree with you say him get right to use him own body.

This one now come bring us question wey dey ask whether human being get right to use any property. for example we go explain property as something wey people dey share, to the point wey be sey everybody suppose get right to own everything, with one kind time table.

That one mean say person wey get lung cancer get right to take at least one lung from person wey nor dey sick. As ownership start from our own body, If nor be only us get our body, na him be sey other people suppose follow us share am. The sick man get right to take one of our lung and e nor dey different from robbing the lung if we nor allow the man take am. Na so me and you get right to use Celine Dion voice sing, since nor be only she get the voice..

If nor be only one person get him body, na him be say rape nor get meaning, since nor be only the woman get her toto,
and na so the man suppose share him body too. if people suppose share every thing, na him be say murder nor get meaning too.

Nor be crime to kill yourself as e nor be crime to burn your own house, since e nor be crime to spoil your own property cos na only you get am. But if nor be only one person get him body then murder nor dey different from suicide. If my liver dey fail and I fit take your own, then I go just take am because nor be bad thing. If you die as I dey take your liver, e nor concern me. If nor be only you get your body, then you nor dey even exist.

so we fit talk say na correct tori to say na one person get him own body. Say every human being for every where get ownership of their own body, and so as e be  them nor fit share their own body, whether e concern morality or to make or to own property.

### The Areas Wey Grey

Naturally, tori wey be like the one wey dey up dey always talk about complexity and I agree with am.

Imagine say I wan give you five dollars as gift, but I come give you ten dollars by mistake and I tell you say that one na for you. Some people go say na stealing if I come tell you say na five dollars I mean to give you instead of ten dollars, the moment after you don pocket the money. Even if na my own money wey I give you, out of free will.

For the other end, if you be one of my pikin, and when I pay your school fee I tell you say you nor need to pay me back. this thing wey I do for you go affect how you dey spend money. And e nor go make sense for me to slap my head after you graduate come cry say, I think say you be my other pikin and I want my money back..

Na so e dey everywhere say children nor fit enter legal contract, but adults go fit. For many society the age of difference na eighteen years. This one mean say na by mid night when man wan cross from seventeen to eighteen years wey him go fully mature to enter legal contract. So this on mean say him body don experience plenty changes for that split second ? No way.  
But for this eighteen years him don change well well from when him dey ten years, for body and for thinking.

to make things easy, if e nor be perfect morality, arbitrary transition dey always dey in the middle of one state and another. One stage na childhood and the other stage na adulthood. The change from pikin to adult dey blend well,  e nor be black and white, but instead e be like as day time dey turn to evening and then night. Day time nor be night, and mid night nor be day time but e get time for middle when e dey hard for person to tell
which one be which one, even though the direction of the change go always dey clear.

na the same way we nor fit blame man wey don psycho for him actions. Man wey him IQ be sixty five go get small sense pass small pikin. Man wey get IQ of one hundred na average adult. If we talk sey man wey get IQ of eighty dey responsible, then indirectly wey dey talk say man wey get IQ of seventy five nor dey responsible
That one na clear demarcation? No way!
But so that most concept go legit. We suppose consider the standard of "wetin good" and reasonable study on top cost/benefit. As we talk before, nor water pure wella, but man go kpeme cos of thirst if him wait for water to pure wella.

As we don see say  the tori about moral responsibility and thinking capacity only apply to few people wey dey for the line, and we see say to create objective and test wey perfect no go dey possible, practical go always win theory. the only thing we fit do, na to assume say since biologist dem dey live with this kind subjectivism every blessed day, e mean say moral philosophers fit survive am somehow.

### PROPERTY AS UNIVERSAL SOMETHING

UPB dey give us options wey clear concerning property rights. e nor fit happen say some men get property right, and other men nor get. e nor fit happen say men for Washington get property rights, and women them for Baltimore nor get. e nor fit happen say men get property rights today, but them nor got get am tomorrow and so on.

e nor fit happen say men only get fifty percent rights.

If I start to argue say "men get fifty percent rights" then I go dey contradict my self. You fit ask whether na me generate everything wey I just tok. If I get only fifty percent right then e clear say na only fifty percent control wey I get over my body – If I you hear those words  wey dey up from me, then e clear sey na only fifty percent control I get over the words.
If na only fifty percent control wey I get over my voice. So na who get the other fifty percent?

This one fit  hard small to understand, but na very serious question, sake of reasons wey we go get soon..

Like say we go fit bypass the "fifty percent ownership of body problem" some how, and human being them get only fifty percent property rights wen e concern external objects.

How dat one dey work for practise ?

If I get two lawnmowers and you nor get even one, den e dey logical  for you to get de right to collect one of my lawnmower, since na only half of my lawnmower collection I suppose get.

howeva, wen you make one of my lawnmowers your own, na only half of de lawnmower you suppose eva get, since all of us only get right to fifty percent ownership of things wey nor be part of our body. So na must for you to find person quick quick wey go follow you share de lawnmower. afta na just twenty five percent go be your own. Howeva de oda person nor fit also get twenty five percent of de lawnmower cos na just fifty percent right wey im get over de things wey be im own – so im too must find person wey go collect fifty percent of wetin im get – and na so de thing go continue dey waka.

De problem with any theory wey argue say people nor suppose get hundred percent right of ownership be say e dey instantly cause "domino effect" of strong regression way be say last last every body get only small ownership right ova almost everytin, and dat one nor fit happen. So e must happen – say both logically and practically we get complete ownership ova our own body and ova de thing wey our body do, wen you dey talk of external property. we nor need theory of homesteading or just acquisition way of approach to show say property rights dey pure – we know say e pure already cos anybody wey fit behave as im like – even who dey follow argue – don already start to flex him own hundred percent control on top im own body, even on top homesteading plus including oxygen and sound to make im own case.

So as we join UPB with reality as everybody see am, e nor go hard us to understand say since anybody wey dey follow argue property rights dey flex hundred percent control on top im own property, de only question wey we fit ask, na weda property right dey different for different people or not – dis na question wey de true tori of self-ownership and de UPB framework don answer already. wetin dey gud or bad suppose be as everybody think am and na so we go take sabi say everybody get hundred percent property right.

naturally e nor dey possible make things happen anoda way.

### we dey test "Theft"

make we go back to our innocent guinea pig dem, Bob and Doug.

If theft na gud thing, den de problem wey be say one person no fit be gud and bad de same time na hm dey our front so. If Bob get lighter, and stealing nor be bad thing, den Doug must nab Bob lighter. Howeva, dat time wey Doug dey nab Bob lighter, we nor fit say Bob im sef dey do gud thing. After Doug nab Bob lighter, Bob must nab im lighter back. as e be so, na only stealing if de lighter nor be Bob own in de first place. Wen Doug nab de lighter, e nor fit become Doug legit property just like dat, cos if na so den wetin theft mean no make sense. If de time I nab person thing, e don become my legit property, den if I return am de person too don nab my thing . So if as I nab Bob lighter e nor fit be my legit property, den e nor dey possible for Bob to nab de lighter back, cos we nor fit nab wetin be our own, and as I nab am e neva change de fact say na Bob get de lighter.

And na so wey if stealing na gud thing, den de only way Doug go fit arrange as gud person na when im nab Bob lighter.  dat time na only Doug fit be gud person but Bob no fit. But afta none of dem fit say dem gud, unless Doug continue to return de lighter back to Bob, after im nab am den nab am again.

ofcos e funny to imagine say de beta way to behave na for one man to continue to dey nab wetin im return after im nab am. And logic dey try to make us understand say e nor make sense for anybody to behave like dat. – But make we still waka go front for dis mata, make we see wetin we go find. 

No forget sey nor be thief people dem be de mata we dey discuss now, but na de tori wey tok say violation of property rights make sense.  Just imagine say Doug nab Bob lighter cos Doug believe  say "property right nor dey valid" den de idea wey Doug get on top wetin gud or bad go don cast.

if property rights nor dey valid, den pata pata stealing na sometin wey nor make sense, since stealing na just de legit way wey people dey use control dia property.

Property rights sef na just de ways wey people choose to hold control of dia asset dem. e nor be must, as far as say you and me fit join one hippie commune ,come decide to neva use our property rights again. Or if dem come sabi for my neighborhood say e dey sweet me if person take my property. e mean say my lawnmower go soon loss. And so if I write "take am if you like am" on top my laptop come put am for front of my house. den e dey clear say I dey try tell people say I nor want to dey in control of de laptop again.

If Doug nab Bob lighter, na cos Doug wan colonize de lighter – wey be de real meaning of property rights. If Doug nab Bob lighter cos Doug believe say property rights nor dey valid, den wetin im really mean be say " Im wan  colonize Bob lighter cos e nor make sense to  colonize anytin at all".

If Doug come nab Bob lighter, and Doug come reject property right just to defend imsef. Den e mean say Doug nor go fit stop Bob from collecting im lighter back – since property right nor dey valid. Now Doug nor go fit yarn say na im get de lighter, but Bob go fit. Last last, If Doug nab de lighter cos  "stealing na gud thing" den e clear sey Doug nor go fit do anytin if anoda person nab de lighter. e go make small sense if anoda person nab de lighter from Doug hand after Doug don spend time and energy nab de lighter finish. Wetin de tori mean be say for person to try to control any property, e go make sense if dat person go fit get property right ova de things wey im nab. Man pikin nor go waste time to nab wallet if im sabi say anoda man go nab am from im hand later.

To put am anoda way, stealing na affirmation and na also denial of property rights. Any tori of wetin gud or bad wey support stealing, dey affirm and dey also deny property rights – dis one na contradiction wey don make de tori cast.

If we look de side of wetin gud or bad for communism, for instance, we go see say e deny property right for people.  Howeva, na only dose people wey call dem sef "De government"dey get right to control property dem. wetin dis one mean be say  e nor gud make some men control property but e gud for oda men to control property. since biological difference nor dey between person wey dey rule and de people wey im dey rule. now e don clear for us to see say, for de same people,  we get rules for wetin gud and wetin bad wey no blend at all, and e nor fit dey valid. UPB dey talk say make de moral rule dey de same for every body, for every where and every time. To talk say e nor pure for Ivan Denisovich to flex im moral rights – but e pure for Joseph Stalin to flex im moral right – go make ranking to cast, Wey no different from de tori wey say to pour water for inside pool go empty am and e go also full am de same time. Dem go use laugh end de career of any physicist wey tell people dat kind tori – moralist sha dey always tell people de oda tori and people dey always cut cap for dem.
