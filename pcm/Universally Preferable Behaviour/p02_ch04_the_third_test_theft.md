## The Third Test: Theft
## Theft Na The Third Test


We will have to spend a little bit more time on theft, since it inevitably brings into the picture the question of property rights, which is highly contentious for some.

We go nid to spend extra time for this robbery matter, cos e dey always bring tori wey concern ownership and some people dey see dis one as wahala  tori.


There are many ways of approaching the question of property rights, from “homesteading” to legal definitions to practical considerations etc. I will address none of those here, because the question of property rights must fall into the framework of UPB, if UPB is to stand as a rational methodology for evaluating moral propositions.

E get many ways wey we fit look into dis ownership matter,  homesteading na one of them, and by some kind legit explanation and consideration. I no go address them here cos property rights suppose blend with the framework of UPB. if UPB now, go stand as one better way to know how we suppose behave.

Clearly, the moral proposition with regard to property rights is this: either human beings have the right to own property, or they do not.

e don clear sey the behavior we suppose show to ownership matter, na sey  human being either get right to own property or dem no get.


Now the first “property” that must be dealt with is the body. “Ownership” must first and foremost consist of control over one’s own body, because if that control does not exist, or is not considered valid, then the whole question of morality – let alone property – goes out the window.

The first thing wey we go look into na our body. Ownership suppose start with the how people dey control their owl body. Because if them no fit control their self or them no think sey na important thing to control their self. Then the whole tori  about good behavior or even property no dey important.

UPB is a framework for evaluating moral propositions, or arguments about universally preferable behaviour for all mankind. First and foremost, a man must be responsible for his own actions if they are to be judged morally, since as we have argued above, the capacity to choose actions is fundamental to any ethical evaluation.

UPB na system wey dem dey use measure how people dey behave or those behavior wey everybody agree with. Man  must take responsibility for the things wey him do first, before person fit say him do good or bad. Cos as we don talk before, the power to choose how we go behave  dey very important.

If a man has no control over his body, then clearly he has no responsibility for his actions – they are not in fact “his” actions, but rather the actions of his body. Now, no one would rationally argue that if a man strangles another man, it is the murderous fingers that should be put on trial and punished. Clearly, the body cannot entirely control itself, but rather must be to some degree under the direction of the conscious mind.

If man no fit control him self, then we no fit blame am for the things him do. Instead na him body we go blame. Now no body go argue sey if one man press another man neck and the other man die, na the finger wey the man use suppose go prison. As we see am body no fit move alone, na man dey control him body.

What this means is that a man is responsible for the actions of his body, and therefore he is responsible for the effects of those actions. A man is responsible for where he puts his penis, which is how we know that we can judge him for raping someone. He “owns” the actions of his body as surely as he owns his body. To say that a man is responsible for his body but not the effects of his body is to argue that a man is responsible for aiming and throwing a knife, but not for where it lands.

Wetin this one mean be sey na man dey responsible for the things wey him body do and the result of those things. Man dey responsible for where him prick enter, na so we fit talk sey him don rape person. Na him get him body and we fit blame am for the things wey him body dey do. To sey man get him body but we no fit blame man for wetin him body do, be like to say where knife enter, no be the fault of  who throw the knife.

Also, arguing that a man is not responsible for the effects of his body is a self-detonating statement, similar to the ones we examined above. If I say to you: “Men are not responsible for the actions of their bodies,” it would be eminently fair for you to ask me who is working my vocal chords and mouth. If I say that I have no control over my speech – which is an effect of the body – then I have “sustained” my thesis at the cost of invalidating it completely.

And so, we go look like we no get sense to dey argue say we no fit blame man for the result of wetin him body do. If I tell you say make we no blame man for wetin him body do. then e go make sense if you ask me say na wetin dey control my voice and my mouth. If I tell you say no be me dey control my mouth, wey be part of my body. then I go win the argument but I go don use my hand spoil wetin I dey argue.


If I am not at all responsible for my speech, then there is no point arguing with me. A tape recorder is also not responsible for its speech, which is why we tend not to get into virulent disagreements with magnetic strips. In cheesy horror films, young girls seem to be particularly susceptible to demonic possession – the inevitable priest who shows up always offers to talk to the demon in charge of the girl, at which point the girl starts making a sound like Don Ho gargling with ball bearings.

e go dey useless to argue with me, If I no dey responsible for the things way I talk. We no fit argue with tape record cos we no fit blame am for wetin e talk. For horror film na young girls way demon dey like to enter, and when them call pastor, the pastor dey always ask to talk with the demon way dey inside the girl na that time way the girl go start to make noise like person way dey wash mouth with bearings.

This ridiculous portrait is accurate in one sense though – if some other being is in full control of the girl’s vocal chords, it is that being which needs to be addressed, not the girl, who has no control over her responses.

As this thing funny like this, na only one place e fit make sense sha,  if another person dey control the girl mouth, na that person way the pastor suppose talk to instead of the girl, wey no know wetin she dey do.

Thus if I say to you that I do not have control over my speech, you can ask me: who does? If I reply that no one does, then it makes about as much sense to argue with me as it does to argue with a television set, or the aforementioned boulder as it bounces down a hillside towards you car.


So if I tell you say no be me dey control my mouth, then you go ask me who dey control am then. If tell you say nobody dey control am, then to argue with me go be like to argue with television, or the rock wey talk before, as e dey roll come where your mottor dey.


Thus the very act of controlling my body to produce speech demands the acceptance of my ability to control my speech – an implicit affirmation of my ownership over my own body.

So to control my mouth to talk I need to agree say na me dey control my mouth. This one show say na get ownership of my body.

Now, if demonic possession were a valid occurrence, and a girl possessed by a demon spat on a priest, we would not call the girl rude, but would rather pity her for being inhabited by such an impolite demon. Whoever has control over the girl’s body is culpable for the effects of her actions – this is why we would not call a man who stole while sleepwalking “evil,” since he did not have full control over his own body (although we may restrain him in other ways). This is also the basis for the legal defence of “not guilty by reason of insanity,” which is that we assume that a man who is insane does not have full control over his actions.

Now if demon dey enter person for real life, and girl we demon dey inside come pour the pastor spit. we no go talk say the girl no get respect but we go pity her cos the demon inside her dey wicked.
Na who dey control the girl body wey we go blame for wetin the girl dey do.
Na why we no go say man wey thief something as him they waka for him sleep na bad man. cos him no fit control him self when him dey sleep. This one na why dem set up Legal Defense of say,  person no fit dey guilty if the person don kolo. We assume say person wey kolo no go fit control himself.

Thus to reject the ownership of the body is to reject all morality, which, as we have seen above, is utterly impossible. Logically, since morality is defined as an enforceable subset of UPB, to reject morality is to say that it is universally preferable to believe that there is no such thing as universal preferences.

So to agree say no be person get him body, na to like to say the way we behave no matter, wey as we don see for up no dey possible at all.
Since morality na one of the things wey make up UPB, to say morality no follow na like to say e no got something wet everybody agree with.


Finally, to use one’s ownership of one’s own body in the form of speech to reject the notion that one can control one’s own body, is a blatant and insurmountable self-contradiction.

Last last, to control your mouth to talk say no be person dey control him body, just be like say you dey argue with yourself.

It is in this way that any rejection of self-ownership can be utterly discarded.

Na like this wey we fit cancel the tori wey talk say no body get ownership of their own body

Since we own our bodies, we also inevitably own the effects of our actions, be they good or bad. If we own the effects of our actions, then clearly we own that which we produce, whether what we produce is a bow, or a book – or a murder.

Cos na we get our body, na we also get get the result of wetin our body do whether na good or bad. If the result of wetin our body do na our own, na him be say na we get wetin we make, whether a arrow, or na book or na murder.

## Property And UPB

## Property And UPB

Even if we reject the above, we can still use UPB to definitively assert the existence of universal property rights.

Even if we no agree with wetin dey up, we fit still use UPB to show sey everybody get  right to own property.

As mentioned above, either human beings have property rights, or they do not. Except for a few grey areas, which we will get to shortly, this remains a universal proposition.

As we talk for before, na either person get right to own property or him no get any right.  This one na wetin everybody believe, except for some areas wey we go talk about soon.

If a man does not have the right to use property, then he does not have the right to use his own body. He does not have the right to use his own lungs, and therefore must stop breathing. Although this sounds silly, it is an immediate and inevitable result of the premise that human beings do not have property rights.

If one man no get right to own property, then him no get right to use him own body. Him go get right to use him lungs, so him suppose breath. Even though this one no make sense, na the same thing wey we mean when we say man no fit own property.



It is fairly safe to assume that anyone you are debating property rights with is drawing breath, and thus agrees with you that he has the right to use his own body at least.

E nor go cos wahala to think say any body wey dey argue property rights with you dey breath, and so the person don already agree with you say him get right to use him own body.

The question then comes up whether or not human beings have the right to exclusive property use. For instance, property could be defined as a sort of time-share principle of ownership, insofar as everyone should have the right to own everything, on some schedule or another.

This one now come bring us question wey dey ask whether human being get right to use any property. for example we go explain property as something wey people dey share, to the point wey be sey everybody suppose get right to own everything, with one kind time table.

This means of course that a man with lung cancer has a right to at least one lung of a healthy person. Since all ownership starts with the body, if we do not have the right to exclusive ownership over our own body, then we must share our body with other people, or be immoral. The sick man has a right to one of our lungs, and if we withhold it from him, that is exactly the same as stealing it. Similarly, both you and I have the right to use Celine Dion’s singing voice, since it is wholly selfish of her to pretend that she has exclusive ownership of it.

That one mean say person wey get lung cancer get right to take at least one lung from person wey nor dey sick. As ownership start from our own body, If nor be only us get our body, na him be sey other people suppose follow us share am. The sick man get right to take one of our lung and e nor dey different from robbing the lung if we nor allow the man take am. Na so me and you get right to use Celine Dion voice sing, since nor be only she get the voice.



If human beings do not possess exclusive ownership over their own bodies, then the crime of rape becomes meaningless, since a woman clearly does not exclusively own her vagina, and neither does a man own his own various orifices. If exclusive self-ownership is not an axiom, then even the crime of murder becomes meaningless.

If nor be only one person get him body, na him be say rape nor get meaning, since nor be only the woman get her toto,
and na so the man suppose share him body too. if people suppose share every thing, na him be say murder nor get meaning too.


It is no crime to commit suicide, any more than it is to set fire to your own house, since the destruction of one’s own property is a valid exercise of ownership. However, if exclusive self-ownership is invalid, then there can be no distinction between murder and suicide. If my liver is failing, and I have a right to take yours, then I can “repossess” it in perfect accordance with morality and honourable behaviour. If this procedure kills you, so what? Without exclusive self-ownership, there is no “you” to begin with…

Nor be crime to kill yourself as e nor be crime to burn your own house, since e nor be crime to spoil your own property cos na only you get am. But if nor be only one person get him body then murder nor dey different from suicide. If my liver dey fail and I fit take your own, then I go just take am because nor be bad thing. If you die as I dey take your liver, e nor concern me. If nor be only you get your body, then you nor dey even exist.

Thus we can reasonably say that exclusive self-ownership is a basic reality – that all human beings at all times and in all places have exclusive ownership over their own bodies, and thus have exclusive ownership over the effects of their own bodies, both in terms of moral behaviour and property creation or acquisition.

so we fit talk say na correct tori to say na one person get him own body. Say every human being for every where get ownership of their own body, and so as e be  them nor fit share their own body, whether e concern morality or to make or to own property.


The Grey Areas

The Areas Wey Grey


Naturally, any statement such as the above brings the inevitable howls of “complexity,” which I fully agree with.

Naturally, tori wey be like the one wey dey up dey always talk about complexity and I agree with am.


Let us say that I mean to give you five dollars as a gift, but by mistake I hand you a ten dollar bill, saying, “This is for you.” Few people would consider it theft if I said, the moment after I handed it to you: “Sorry, I meant to give you five dollars, not ten,” and took the larger note back, even though I am taking back property that I have voluntarily relinquished.

Imagine say I wan give you five dollars as gift, but I come give you ten dollars by mistake and I tell you say that one na for you. Some people go say na stealing if I come tell you say na five dollars I mean to give you instead of ten dollars, the moment after you don pocket the money. Even if na my own money wey I give you, out of free will.


On the other extreme, if you are one of my sons, and I pay for your university education, and explicitly tell you that you never need to pay me back, my generosity will doubtless affect your spending habits. It would scarcely seem reasonable for me to clap my forehead after your graduation ceremony and cry, “Oh, I thought you were one of my other sons!” and demand repayment.


For the other end, if you be one of my pikin, and when I pay your school fee I tell you say you nor need to pay me back. this thing wey I do for you go affect how you dey spend money. And e nor go make sense for me to slap my head after you graduate come cry say, I think say you be my other pikin and I want my money back.



Similarly, it is generally accepted that children cannot enter into legal contracts, but that adults can. In many societies, the differentiating age is eighteen years. This means, of course, that at the stroke of midnight between a man’s seventeenth year and eighteenth birthday, his capacity to enter into legal contracts arrives fully formed. Has he gone through some massive biological transformation in that split second? Certainly not, although at eighteen he is biologically very different than he was at the age of ten, both in terms of physical and mental development.

Na so e dey everywhere say children nor fit enter legal contract, but adults go fit. For many society the age of difference na eighteen years. This one mean say na by mid night when man wan cross from seventeen to eighteen years wey him go fully mature to enter legal contract. So this on mean say him body don experience plenty changes for that split second ? No way.  
But for this eighteen years him don change well well from when him dey ten years, for body and for thinking.




For the sake of efficiency, if not perfect morality, arbitrary transitions are often placed between one state and another. Childhood is definitely one state; adulthood is quite another. The transition between childhood and adulthood is blended; it is not black and white, but rather like the day descending into dusk, and then night. Noon is definitely not night, and midnight is definitely not daytime, but there are times in between when it is harder to tell, although the direction of the transition is always clear.

to make things easy, if e nor be perfect morality, arbitrary transition dey always dey in the middle of one state and another. One stage na childhood and the other stage na adulthood. The change from pikin to adult dey blend well,  e nor be black and white, but instead e be like as day time dey turn to evening and then night. Day time nor be night, and mid night nor be day time but e get time for middle when e dey hard for person to tell
which one be which one, even though the direction of the change go always dey clear.

In the same way, a man who is greatly mentally deficient can be considered far less responsible for his own actions. A man with an IQ of sixty-five is mentally scarcely more than a little child – a man with an IQ of one hundred is an average adult. If we say that a man with an IQ of eighty becomes responsible, then we are by definition saying that a man with an IQ of seventy-nine is not responsible – is that a clear, fair, and utterly objective demarcation? Certainly not, but in order for most concepts to be practical, the criterion of “good enough” and a reasonable cost/benefit analysis must be put into place. As mentioned above, no water is perfectly pure, but waiting for perfect purity would simply cause a man to die of thirst.

na the same way we nor fit blame man wey don psycho for him actions. Man wey him IQ be sixty five go get small sense pass small pikin. Man wey get IQ of one hundred na average adult. If we talk sey man wey get IQ of eighty dey responsible, then indirectly wey dey talk say man wey get IQ of seventy five nor dey responsible
That one na clear demarcation? No way!
But so that most concept go legit. We suppose consider the standard of "wetin good" and reasonable study on top cost/benefit. As we talk before, nor water pure wella, but man go kpeme cos of thirst if him wait for water to pure wella.




Given that the question of moral responsibility and intellectual capacity only applies to a very small percentage of people right on the border, and that creating objective and perfect tests is very likely to prove impossible, there will inevitably be some “rules of thumb” that win the day. We can only assume that, since biologists live with this kind of occasional subjectivism every day, moral philosophers can somehow survive as well.

As we don see say  the tori about moral responsibility and thinking capacity only apply to few people wey dey for the line, and we see say to create objective and test wey perfect no go dey possible, practical go always win theory. the only thing we fit do, na to assume say since biologist dem dey live with this kind subjectivism every blessed day, e mean say moral philosophers fit survive am somehow.


Property As Universality

PROPERTY AS UNIVERSAL SOMETHING

UPB only thus gives us clear options with regards to property rights. It cannot be the case that some men have property rights, while other men do not. It cannot be the case that men in Washington have property rights, while women in Baltimore do not. It cannot be the case that men have property rights today, but not tomorrow, and so on.

UPB dey give us options wey clear concerning property rights. e nor fit happen say some men get property right, and other men nor get. e nor fit happen say men for Washington get property rights, and women them for Baltimore nor get. e nor fit happen say men get property rights today, but them nor got get am tomorrow and so on.

It also cannot be the case that men have only fifty percent property rights.

e nor fit happen say men only get fifty percent rights.

If I argue: “Men only have fifty percent property rights,” then I create yet another insurmountable contradiction. You may well ask me which half of my sentence was not generated by me. If I only have fifty percent property rights, then clearly I only have fifty percent control over my own body – if I put forward the above sentence, then clearly I am only in control of fifty percent of that sentence, since I only have fifty percent control over my voice. Who, then, is responsible for the other fifty percent of my sentence?

If I start to argue say "men get fifty percent rights" then I go dey contradict my self. You fit ask whether na me generate everything wey I just tok. If I get only fifty percent right then e clear say na only fifty percent control wey I get over my body – If I you hear those words  wey dey up from me, then e clear sey na only fifty percent control I get over the words.
If na only fifty percent control wey I get over my voice. So na who get the other fifty percent?


This may sound esoteric, but it is a deadly serious question, for reasons that we will get to shortly.

This one fit  hard small to understand, but na very serious question, sake of reasons wey we go get soon.

Let us say that we can somehow magically bypass the “fifty percent ownership of the body” problem, and say that human beings only have fifty percent property rights when it comes to external objects.

Like say we go fit bypass the "fifty percent ownership of body problem" some how, and human being them get only fifty percent property rights wen e concern external objects .


How does that work in practice?

Well, if I have two lawnmowers and you have none, then clearly it would be logical for you to have the right to take one of my lawnmowers, since I can only ever own half of my lawnmower collection.

However, when you take possession of one of my lawnmowers, unfortunately you are only ever allowed to own *half* of that lawnmower, since we only have the right to fifty percent ownership over external objects. Thus you must immediately find somebody with whom you can share the lawnmower. This brings your “just” ownership down to twenty-five percent. However, your new co-owner cannot have the right to twenty-five percent of the lawnmower, because he only has fifty percent rights for whatever ownership he possesses – thus he must find somebody to take fifty percent of the twenty-five percent that he has – and so on and so on and so on.

The problem with any theory that argues for less than one hundred percent property rights is that it instantly creates a “domino effect” of infinite regression, wherein everybody ends up with infinitely small ownership rights over pretty much everything, which is clearly impossible. Thus it must be the case – both logically and practically – that we have full ownership over our own bodies, and over the effects of our bodies, in terms of external property. We do not need a homesteading theory, or other “just acquisition” approaches to justify property rights – they are justified because anybody who acts in any way, shape or form – including arguing – is axiomatically exercising one hundred percent control over his own body, and “homesteading” both oxygen and sound waves in order to make his case.

Thus, by combining this axiomatic reality with UPB, we can easily understand that since anyone debating property rights is exercising one hundred percent control over his own property, the only question is whether or not property rights vary from individual to individual – a question definitively settled by the axiomatic fact of self-ownership, as well as the UPB framework. Any moral proposition must be universal and consistent, and this is how we also know that *everyone* has one hundred percent property rights.

Any other possibility is logically and empirically impossible.

### Testing "Theft"

Let us return to our patient moral guinea pigs, Bob and Doug.

If theft is morally good, then once again we face the problem of the impossibility of simultaneous morality. If Bob has a lighter, and it is morally good to steal, then Doug must steal Bob’s lighter. However, the moment that Doug is stealing Bob’s lighter, Bob cannot himself be moral. The moment *after* Doug steals his lighter, Bob must then steal “his” lighter back – however, it is only “stealing” if the lighter is *not* legitimately Bob’s in the first place. When Doug steals Bob’s lighter, the lighter does not legitimately become Doug’s property, otherwise the concept of theft would make no sense. If, the moment I steal something, it becomes my legitimate property, then restitution would itself become theft. If, however, I do *not* establish legitimate ownership by stealing Bob’s lighter, then clearly it is impossible for Bob to “steal” the lighter *back*, because we cannot steal what we already own, and my theft has not invalidated Bob’s ownership of his lighter.

Thus, if stealing is good, then goodness becomes a state achievable only in the instant that Doug steals Bob’s lighter. In that instant, only Doug can be moral, and Bob cannot be. After that, goodness becomes impossible to achieve for either party, unless Doug keeps giving Bob’s lighter back and then snatching it away again.

Of course, it seems patently ridiculous to imagine that the ideal moral state is for one man to keep giving another man back the property he has stolen, and then immediately stealing it again. Thus logic seems to validate our instinctual understanding of the foolishness of this as a moral ideal – but let’s go a little further, to see if it still holds.

Remember, we are not particularly concerned with individual criminals, but rather with moral theories that justify violations of property rights. For instance, if Doug steals Bob’s lighter because Doug believes that “No property rights are valid,” then Doug’s moral theory instantly self-detonates.

If no property rights are valid, then stealing is a completely illogical action, since stealing is an assertion of the just desire to control property.

Property rights themselves are nothing more than the assertion of a just desire to retain control over assets. It is optional, insofar as you and I can join some hippie commune, and decide to never assert our property rights ever again. Or, if it becomes known in my neighbourhood that I am more than happy if somebody takes my property, it seems somewhat more likely that my lawnmower will go missing. Similarly, if I put a notebook computer on my front lawn with a sign saying “yours if you want it,” then I am clearly signalling that I have no desire to retain current or future control over the notebook.

If Doug steals Bob’s lighter, it is because Doug has a desire to gain control over the lighter – which is the very definition of property rights. If Doug steals Bob’s lighter because Doug believes that property rights are invalid, then what he is really saying is: “I want to gain control over Bob’s lighter because it is never valid to gain control over any object.”

If Doug does steal Bob’s lighter, but then defends his theft through a rejection of property rights, then clearly Doug cannot object to Bob taking his lighter back – since property rights are invalid, Doug now has no more valid claim to own the lighter than Bob did. Finally, if Doug steals Bob’s lighter under the principle “theft is good,” then clearly Doug could have no logical objection to someone else stealing the lighter immediately. However, it would make precious little sense for Doug to spend time and energy stealing Bob’s lighter if the moment he had it in his hot little hands, someone else snatched it away from him. In other words, working to gain control of a piece of property is only valid if you can assert your property rights over the stolen object. No man will bother stealing a wallet if he has certain knowledge that it will be stolen from him the moment he gets his hands on it.

In other words, theft in practice is both an affirmation of property rights and a denial of property rights. Any moral theory that supports theft thus both affirms and denies the existence of property rights – an insurmountable contradiction which completely invalidates any such theory.

If we look at the moral aspects of communism, for instance, property rights are explicitly denied for the individual. However, those individuals who call themselves “the government” do claim the right to control property. What this means in practice is that it is *evil* for some men to control property, but it is *good* for other men to control property. Since there is no biological distinction in terms of species between ruler and ruled, we can clearly see that here, for the same species, we have completely opposite moral rules, which cannot be valid. UPB explicitly demands that moral rules be consistent for all men, in all places, and at all times – saying that it is immoral for Ivan Denisovich to exercise his property rights – but *moral* for Joseph Stalin to exercise *his* property rights – creates a rank contradiction, akin to saying that pouring water into a swimming pool both fills it and empties it at the same time. Any physicist who proposed the latter would be laughed out of his profession – moralists, however, regularly propose the former, and are greeted with mysterious levels of respect.
