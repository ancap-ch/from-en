### "No Chop Fish"

Na how we  see dis proposition: Na bad thing to eat fish?

E clear sey dis proposition dey meet up to some UPB requirement – e be as everybody  think am, no mata which time or place and  e dey objective.

yes e dey somehow hard make we call dis one moral theory – why?

First first, "evil" follow for action wey we fit use force prevent. Rape na "evil" thing and so I fit use force defend my sef if person try to rape me.

I fit say e just for me to  shoot person wey chop small fish ?

e go dey somehow silly to argue sey I fit – but why?

De way wey everybody see doctrine get some objective limits.  For instance, some people fit nor get access to fish – dem fit dey live for desert – and oda people dey live near lake dey see fish anyhow, and e come dey hard make dem live without chopping fish. Howeva dat one nor dey enough,  since we don already accept de fact say as euncuh nor fit rape person e nor mean sey de moral proposition wey yarn say "e dey bad to rape" nor dey valid.

No, de "red herring" na de fish wey dey inside de moral proposition wey yarn say "na bad thing to chop fish

Scientist nor fit yarn say na only pink rock wey im theory of gravity apply to. Since im theory na about gravity, e must apply to everytin wey  get weight.

Na de same, with de example for up, UPB dey only accept say person fit eat but e reject wetin d person dey eat, since wetin de person dey eat nor be work but instead na wetin im dey work on top.

Na de same way wey ethicist nor fit  yarn say de moral proposition of say na bad thing to rape old people dey valid. Rape na de behaviour, so weda de victim old or not, e nor mata to moral proposition. As far as say de victim na human being, de UPB requirement nor fit change. According to UPB "Thou shall not steal" na valid moral proposition, but "thou shall not still turnip" nor follow at all, cos of say theft relate to concept of property. And we nor fit separate turnip wey be part of property from oda forms of property den come give dem dia own moral rule

D moral proposition wey yarn say e bad to chop fish, don fail test as everybody think am cos e dey too specific to say na so everybody see am – e be like to say na only pink rock wey my theory of gravity apply to. If na theory of gravity true true den e must apply to every every. If e only apply to pink rocks, den e nor be theory of gravity.

UPB dey also reject any theory wey dey bring opposing moral judgement for actions wey dey de same. Assault nor fit turn gud one day den bad de next day. so we know sey to chop nor fit gud one day den bad de next day.

To chop fit only gud or bad or e just dey for middle. If to eat bad, den e go get many oda logical problem, wey I dey sure we alreay know by now.

If on de oda hand, to eat dey gud, den e nor fit dey gud to eat cabbage den bad to eat fish, since dat one dey violate wetin dey universal, as far as say na d same action wey be – To eat – wey e dey judge gud and bad d same time.

Na like dis wey we take understand say de proposition wey say "e bad to eat fish" don fail UPB test, and e nor follow as moral theory.

### Rights For Animal Dem

We nor get time to enta dis mata of animal right wella, but we fit at least deal with dis moral proposition of "e bad to chop fish" 

If e bad to kill fish, den UPB say any person or anything wey kill de fish dey evil. nor be only fishermen, but shark dem follow too – since if to kill fish na bad thing, we don expand how we dey take define ethical actors and now e don include non-human life.

E clear sey shark nor fit stop im sef to kill fish, since na eating machine with fin wey dem dem be.

So now we don end up with de logical problem of "inevitable evil". If e bad to kill fish, but sharks dem nor fit avoid to kill fish, den sharks dem be " inevitable evil". Howeva as we don talk before, where person nor get choice – where e nor dey possible to avoid de thing – gud or bad nor fit dey dia. So de proposition of "e bad to kill fish" dey try to define universal morality for make non-moral situations follow inside, wey nor fit standa logically.

Also, na de word "fish" still be de problem for d formulation, since e dey too specific to dey universal. De correct UPB reformulation na say "na bad thing for people to kill living things”.

If, somehow e dey bad to kill, we go face de problem of " inevitable evil" again. e nor get any human being wey fit exist without killing oda living things dem like virus, plant and even animal dem. So dem define  "human life" as "evil". But if dem define human life as evil, den e nor fit be evil wen avoidance nor dey possible.

imagine if we say, " na evil thing to kill people" – na im be say shark wey dey eat person dey evil?

No – once again, since shark dem no fit avoid to kill people, we nor fit blame dem for such actions, just as we nor fit carry landslide go court cos e kill person.

UPB dey allow exception based on objective and universal material or biological difference, just as oda science dey do. De scientific theory way say gas dey expand wen e hot apply to only gas. I nor fit spoil d theory cos I prove say e nor apply to plastic.

Na so morality apply to consciousness, cos of requirement for wetin person fit avoid. If I try to apply moral theory on top snail, or tree or rock or numbers dem, I dey try to say these things fit know wetin dem dey do, mean while dem nor know and dat one dey contradict logic. I fit talk say de  opposite angle theorem for geometry nor valid cos e nor apply to circle or cloud. De OAT only apply to line wey dey cross each oda – to try to apply am for anoda mata be like to paint air.

No put am anoda way, misapplication nor be disproof

e get many oda "areas wey grey" wey we fit work on, from abortion to intellectual property rights to returning wetin we steal and so on, But wetin I think be sey e dey very important to carry UPB comot for where e nor exist come begin apply am to de problems wey we dey face today.
