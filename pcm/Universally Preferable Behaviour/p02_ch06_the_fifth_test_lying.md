## Lying Na The Number Five Test

de tori of lying dey interesting, cos everybody like make people dey yarn truth, but nor be wetin dem fit do by force.

this na sometin wey people consider as wetin hard pass to go places early. But e nor hard reach stealing. Wetin UPB framework get to talk for this mata ?

Naturally, any theory of gud and bad wey propose say "To lie gud" dey cast shap shap, since e gud say de person wey propose am dey lie too, den e mean say lying nor gud, cos im don talk true say to lie nor gud.

Just imagine:

**Bob:** Lie na gud thing

**Doug:** You dey lie ?

**Bob:** Yes.

**Doug:** So to lie na bad thing, since you dey lie sey na good thing.

Or:

**Bob:** To Lie na gud thing

**Doug:** You dey lie?

**Bob:** No.

**Doug:** So to Lie everytime nor be gud thing, since you dey talk true say to lie na gud thing.

To lie, howeva, nor need force, and e nor violate the fact say we fit avoid am. Since we fit avoid  people wey sabi lie, dem nor suppose suffer cos dem lie.

Somehow lying dey de same category with violence, as far as say e nor bad to use lie defend your sef. just as e nor bad to use violence defend your sef. e hard to think sey person fit dey late to defend im sef or dey rude. Howeva if area boy break enta your house come say im wan know where your wife dey so dat im go fit just dey slap her anyhow. E go look sey na gud thing if you nor lie. lying for here go be like third party defence, and as e nor bad like to use violence to defend your sef na so if person use lie collect money from you e nor bad to use lie collect the money back.

So e nor bad if we lie to who dey lie, just as e nor bad if we use punch defend punch,   but we nor go see am as important to show up later just to pay back person wey like lateness.

de difference na say " to dey late" nor dey too spoil things as to lie. Person wey like lateness dey annoying, but im nor block your eye to see wetin dey happen.  Na one thing for me to show up one hour late for meeting wey go start by seven o'Clock for morning – na another thing for me to try to convince you say we been set de meeting for eight o'clock in de morning, wen I know say nor be true.

To dey attack your confidence for your own mind  dey far more egregious than just to make you wait, since you dey use anoda person trust for you, to spoil de trust wen im get for im sef, and dis one dey highly corrupt, since na to use value spoil value, like to make counterfeit. Na so UPB validate the illogic of the proposition wey say "to lie na gud thing"  and e confirm say to lie to person worse pass lateness but e beta pass assault”.

[^5]: Sometimes dem dey call am "gas-lighting" cos of one olden days movie like dat.
