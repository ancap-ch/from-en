## Lifeboat Scenarios

D fact say UPB dey only validate theories wey dey continuously reasonable no mean say e no get situation wey person no fit bear wey be say we fit act *against* wetin concern such theory.

Make we reason like dis, if we gree for the worldwide property confirmation right, to break person window and jump enter em house wit the person allow you e dey against him power for him belongings. As e be, if we con dey hang for flagpole outside window of house, and we want con fall die, small of us no go gree kick d window jump enter wia safe just say we dey obey principle wey we no dey see.

For normal world, e go take person wey ova wicked to carry person wey destroy window go court make him for save em life – jux as e go take man wey ova dey irresponsible make him pay money take replace d window. The principle of “avoidability” na be the main thing here – man wey dey hang for flagpole get small choice to dey kick window.  Man wey dey break enter your house to thief something still get the mind make em no invade your property – em no dey corner, but con be the *initiator* of the offence. This one resemble the difference wey dey between the woman wey her husband cheat on her, versus the woman wey her husband lock her for basement.

No be to talk say if person break window to save himself na bad thing. E be, but na bad thing wey be say all of us go like do dan say we die. I don reach d point say I go die I go thief apple. E no mean say na gud thing make I thief apple – e jux mean say I go do am – and I go bear d punishment of wetin I thief.[^10].

### Grey Areas

The fact sey confirm “grey areas” dey exist for ethics realm dem don too use am to rank how things relate to one another. Since, for sometime some things no clear (e.g person wey initiate the use of violence), and since em dey hard to explain object and accurate rule for every situation wey person see, the final thing wey dem dey talk be say nothing fit *ever* dem sabi for sure, and say no objective rule dey exist for *any* situation.

Dis na lie.

Every person wey dey reason well recognize say biology na confirm science, despite say dem born some animals with “one-off” changes. The fact say dem fit born dog with five legs no mean say “canine” con become entirely person opinion thing. The fact say some confirm species of insects dey challenging to differentiate no mean say no get any difference between bettle and whale.

For some perverse reason, people wey sabi something well well dey derive joy to dey destroy wetin dey good, legit and reasonable standard. Dis fit be say because corrupt people like politicians, priests and kings fit don pay all dis people wey sabi book well well – or fit be say person dey sabi things well well make him dey justify em own bad behavior. No matter the reason, the present thinker don become species of “people wey dey against thinking”, wey no bam. E dey equivalent to say em get too many “biologists” wey spend most of dia live dey argue say the science of biology dey impossible. If the science of biology dey impossible, em dey hard to become biologist, pass say person wey no believe in God dey fight tooth and nail.

### Shades Of Grey

For the world of “grey areas”, e get only three things wey possible.

1. Nothing wey dey bear grey areas.
2. Some kind grey areas no dey exist
3. All wetin person sabi na grey area

E clear say, dem fit remove option one. Option three dey fairly easy to remove. The statement say “all knowledge na grey area” na wetin person reason by emself con suggest am, as we see am above, in the same way say “all statements dem be lies” be like person use em mouth kill emself.

Den we fit go with option two, wey be say confirm grey areas no dey exist, and we know say dem be grey wey relate to areas wey no grey. Oxygen dey exist for space, and also for underwater, but no be for form or quantity wey human beings fit chop. The *degree* of oxygenation na grey area, i.e less versus more”; the question of say weda human beings fit breath or no fit breathe water na surely black and white.

Scientist wey people wey dey chop person catch fit act like em be witch-doctor make em for escape – this no mean say we go throway the scientific method as wetin no hold water at all.

As wetin dey the same, e get situations wey too much wey we fit choose to commit bad thing, but dat kind thing no remove the science of knowing wetin good and wetin no good, anything wey pass occasional change dey render the science of biology useless. In fact, dem don too much advance the science of biology through the acceptance and to dey check change – e also resemble say the science of wetin good and bad dey only strong through checking of “lifeboat scenarios”, as long as say dat kind check dem no dey pursue am with passion.

### Worldwide And Wetin no dey acceptable

Before we start to dey use our framework of the kind behavior wey dem dey accept for all ova the world to examine common good or bad beliefs wey dem dey hold, we need deal with question of “exceptions”.

To dey use above “lifeboat scenarios”, the conclusion dey always be say “the good” dey easy *dat wey dey “good” for one man life*.

For argument of wetin good and bad, if dem ask me weda I go thief apple dan say hunger kill me – and I say “yes” – dem no fit stop to dey argue these things wey follow so:

1. Make everybody dey thief appeal dan say dem die bcus dem no see food chop.
2. Den everybody for the world like to dey thief apple to die by say dem no dey chop.
3. Den dem like am all ova d world to dey thief apple dan to die by say dem no dey chop food.
4. Den people like to survive pass person claim to him property.
5. Den wetin good for one person na em be the best for wetin gud and bad standard.

Dem don use am as the basis for a numba of theories of wetin good or bad and approach, from Nietzsche to Rand. How dem take dey like one person for survival dey translated into wetin good and bad theories wey put the survival of the person as the main thing.[^11]

Dis kind of “biological hedonism” fit be how dem take dey describe the “drive to survive”, but em only correct as far as say em dey describe wetin people actually *do*, no be wetin dem *should* do.

The thing dey bring entirely wetin no dey practical d way person understanding to d question of wetin gud and wetin bad. For example, if e dey gud to dey thief food if you dey hunger, how much food you go thief? How you fit bear d hunger? You fit thief food wey no dey nutritious? How the food fit make person feel alright before you go thief am? How far afta you don thief one food before you fit go thief anoda one? Den dey allow you thief meat or you find work or ask person make e help you?

Also, if I fit make money as I be hit man dan I be shopkeeper, make I no pursue wahala as wetin I take dey chop? Em dey help *my* survival… and so on and so on.

As we fit see, the introduction of “wetin gud for man wey eye no dey see – or wetin many people dey do – na wetin dey acceptable everywhere” dey spoil the talk of knowing gud and bad as wetin dey reasonable and always be like dat, and as wetin get anoda one for common biological drives as makeup for the way people take dey behave. The tin na dey explain how peole take dey behave, no be wetin dem still dey consida concerning good and bad theory.

### The reason and the kasala

For your patient undastanding, one last question we suppose talk before we explain and confirm how the different good and bad propositions fit in for the UPB makeup. Since, d work wey hard pass dey ahead, make we relax and remind ourselves why we dey put ourselves through all diz kurukuru and suffa.

For anoda way, before we continue, e dey important to ask d question: “why bother?”

Why dey wori to explain wetin dey guide good and bad? To talk d truth, people no need am, and bad people no dey consult dem. People go do wetin dem like, and carry somtin back am up – why com dey disturb yourself dey teach people about how to take know wetin good and bad.

Of course, the danger always dey wey be say bad person go attack you for em own selfish purpose. E fit also be say, despite clean and person dey live well, cancer fit kill person before em time – the former no make the science of knowing how to do the good thing no hold water, any more pass the other one con make the science of medicine, nutrition and exercise no hold water. One thing wey reasonable science of doing good thing dey show be say e dey reduce your chance of *suffering* bad things wey be like thief, killing person and rape – and na by this criteria we go use judge the better rules wey dey for Part Three of dis book.

[^10]: Of course, if I be person wey no sabi do anything or I be confuse human being I for don die for hunger, prison na for help me pass.

[^11]: Nietzsche’s “will to power” and Rand’s “wetin serve for man life e gud”.
