##Behavior wey dem prefer Universally

Because of the argument wey dey up, we see say e dey impossible to enter inside debate if we no accept the premise say some certain behaviors dey “universally preferable”.

I use the word “behavior” for here instead of “thought” because e dey important to differentiate between internal and states wey nor dey verifiable such as “thinking” from objective and states wey dey verifiable such as “acting”, “writing” and speaking”.

E nor dey possible to prove say I dream of elephant last night. E nor dey possible to prove say I don write the word “elephant”, and that na why I use the word “behavior” instead of “thought”;

To agree after dem don convince me to superior logic inside argument na *action*. If every time wey I tey lose a point to you, I no talk anything, but instead, I just dey look you blankly, you go find am irritating rather than to dey follow me argue. To concede one point, I must do the action of verbal agreement upon conviction.

Therefore, them fit see am as inherent for every act of arguing na number of embedded premises wey dem no fit overturn conceivably.

If I tell you may you meet me for tennis court, and you con come with rifle wey dem tey dey hunt, we fit end up playing a sport of sorts, but na sure thing say e nor go be tennis. When I ask you may you meet me for tennis court for game, e mean say that request na acceptance of the rules of tennis.

For history, those wey dey engaged for ethical debate don fail most times to maintain the reality wey dey basic.

I nor fit submit scientific paper wey dem write for my own personal language, dey claim say my psychic goldfish don refer am, and com dey expect make dem take me seriously. For the same way, I nor fit start one debate wey dey philosophical on ethics and wey get reference to my own personal values, and com dey claim say my argument don dey validated by Trixie the ominiscient and invisible leprechaun, then com dey expect make dem take me seriously.
That particular act of debating go require make them accept the universally preferable behavior (UPB). E nor get way may dem fit tey respond rationally to argument wey dey ethical *without* say dem no exhibit UPB.
Make we now turn to the series of proofs wey dey positive for UPB.

### UPB and Validity

One of the main challenges wey modern philosophers dey face na the need to prove say moral rules dey both possible and universal. Until moral rules go dey subjected to the same rigour and logic as the other proposition, we go forever dey stymied by subjectivism, political prejudices and the pragmatic.

The historical analogy wey dey closest to our present situation occur during the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries when the scientific method tey rise. The first first pioneers wey advocate for rational and empirical approach to knowledge still face the same prejudices wey we dey face today – all the same irrationalities, the entrenched powers of church and state, mystical and subjective “absolutes” and early educational barriers. Those people wey still advocate the primacy of rationality and empirical observations on top Biblical fundamentalism and secular tyrannies com face the opposition wey dey determined and wey dey carry both cross and sword. Dem torture many of dem to death for their honesty wey dey intellectual – we dey face risk wey no even big sef, and so we suppose dey far more courageous wen we dey advocate for wetin dey *true* over wetin dey *believed*.

If we wan attack false moralities, we must to start from the beginning, just as the scientist wey first dey tey do. Francis Bacon no argue say the scientific method dey more “efficient” than prayer, Bible texts or visions wey na starvation induce. He just simply talk say if we wan understand nature, we must first observe nature and theorise am logically – and say e *no get* any other route to knowledge.

We must follow the same approach if we wan define and tell people about *morality*. We must begin to dey use the power and legitimacy wey follow scientific method to tey prove the validity and universality of laws wey dey moral. We must start from the beginning to dey build logically and reject *any* substitutes  wey no dey rational or non- empirical wey dey for the truth.

Wetin this thing be like for practice? All we need to do na to establish the following axioms:

- Morality na concept wey dey valid.
- Moral rules must dey consistent for all mankind.
- The validity of any moral theory go dey judged by e consistency.

To start from the first first beginning… moral values – or human behaviors wey dey universally preferable – dey valid at all?
Na only two possibilities dey if we come to moral rules, just as logical science tey dey. Either universal moral rules dey valid, or dem nor dey.[^6]
A rule go fit dey valid if e *exist empirically*, like gravity, or because na *true*, like the equation wey be two plus two na four.

We go then ask this kind question first: moral rules dey exist at all?
Certainly no be for material reality, wey no contain or obey even single moral value. Moral rules different from the rules of physics, just as scientific method tey different from gravity. Matter naturally dey obey gravity or the second law of thermodynamics, but “thou shalt not murder” no dey anywhere for the nature of things. Physics laws dey “describe” the behavior wey matter get, but e no contain single *prescription*. Science talk say matter *dey* behave for one kind manner – and no be say e *gp* behave for one kind manner. A theory of gravity prove say if you push one man comot for cliff, e go fall. E nor go talk whether *make you* push am or not. 

Therefore, dem no fit talk say moral rules dey exist for material reality, talkless of say dem dey automatically obey the laws wey physics get – wey *no* mean say the moral laws na lie, subjective or e nor dey relevant.
If we fit prove say moral theories fit dey objective, rational, and them fit verify am, this one go bring the same benefits to ethics wey if you subject *physical* theories to the scientific method do.

Before scientific method rise, people believe say matter dey obey the whims of the gods and devils wey dey objective – and people dey believe the same for morality even till now. Say volcanoes dey happen because say the mountain-god dey angry; good harvest na because of human and animal sacrifice. Nobody believe say absolute physical laws go limit the power wey the gods get – and science no com develop. Those people wey profit for history wey dem tey define physical reality say e dey subjective – especially priests and aristocrats – come fight for the subjugation of physical theories to the scientific method own, just like those wey dey gain from the one wey dey define morality say e dey objective this days – especially those priests and politicians- this days dey fight the *moral* theories make e come be objective and universal principles.

As dem mention for up, the scientific method na essential method to separate wetin correct from theories wey no correct if you subject am to two central test: consistency wey dey logical and observation wey dey empirical – and to dey always subjugate consistency wey dey logical to observations wey dey empirical. If I propose one theory wey dey consistent perfectly and wey still dey logical wey talk say rock go float *up* wen dem throw am comot for cliff, any empirical tests go prove say my theory no correct, since observation dey always pass hypothesis.

If we look further inside scientific method, e get the belief say, since matter get atoms wey dey combined inside dem wey get the same physical and properties wey dem fit predict, the behavior of matter must still dey common, stable and dem go fit still fit predict am.  Therefore dem must still fit *reproduce* experiments for different locations and times. I nor fit talk say my “rock floating” theory dey correct for only one particular rock, or for the day wey I first test am, or for one particular place. My theories must describe the behavior wey *matter* get wey dey universal, common, stable and predictable.

Finally, e get one rule wey dem accept generally – sometimes dem dey call am Occam’s Razor – wey talk say any of this two theories  get the same predictive power, the one wey simple pass among the two dey preferable. Before the Copernican revolution, when dem consider earth as the centre of the universe, the retrograde motion of Mars when Earth pass am for Orbit around the sun com cause big problems to the Ptolemaic system of astronomical calculations. “Circles within circles” com plenty well well, wey com clean comot wen dem  place the sun for the centre of the solar system and com accept say the planetary orbits get elliptical nature.
Therefore any scientific theory wey dey valid must dey (a) universal (b) logical (c) dem go fit verify am empirically (d) dem go fit reproduce am (e) e go dey as simple as possible.
The methodology for judging and proving a *moral* theory is exactly the same as the methodology for judging and proving any other theory.

#### Moral Rules: A way to define am

The first question wey concern moral rules na: *wetin* dem be?
Make we simply put say *morals* na the set of rules wey dey claim to accurately and consistently dey identify human behavior wey dem prefer universally, just as *physics* na set of rules wey dey claim to accurately and consistently identify the behavior wey matter get universally.
The second question wey dem go ask na: e get any such thing as “universally preferable behavior” at all?
If e dey, we go begin dey look which kind behavior e go be. If not, then our examination go stop for here – just as the examination of Ptolemaic astronomy tay stop after dem accept am commonly say the sun na really the centre of the solar system.

[^6]: For physics, the question na: either universal physical rules dey valid, or dem nor dey.
