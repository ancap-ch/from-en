##Behavior wey dem prefer Universally
Because of the argument wey dey up, we see say e dey impossible to enter inside debate if we no accept the premise say some certain behaviors dey “universally preferable”
I use the word “behavior” for here instead of “thought” because e dey important to differentiate between internal and states wey nor dey verifiable such as “thinking” from objective and states wey dey verifiable such as “acting”, “writing” and speaking.”
E nor dey possible to prove say I dream of elephant last night. E nor dey possible to prove say I don write the word “elephant,” and that na why I use the word “behavior” instead of “thought.”;
To agree after dem don convince me to superior logic inside argument na *action*. If every time wey I tey lose a point to you, I no talk anything, but instead, I just dey look you blankly, you go find am irritating rather than to dey follow me argue. To concede one point, I must do the action of verbal agreement upon conviction.
Therefore, them fit see am as inherent for every act of arguing na number of embedded premises wey dem no fit overturn conceivably.
If I tell you may you meet me for tennis court, and you con come with rifle wey dem tey dey hunt, we fit end up playing a sport of sorts, but na sure thing say e nor go be tennis. When I ask you may you meet me for tennis court for game, e mean say that request na acceptance of the rules of tennis.
