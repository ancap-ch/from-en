## Existence Versus Non-Existence

We dey talk say “warin nor dey exist” and warin nor carry weight or power, or carry d beta change for weight or power, like to find d join body of gravity.

God nor carry weight or energy, or show d effects of mass or energy – God nor fix be detectable or verifiable at all, shape or form, weather na wit human being senses or wit rationality.

ok, if I talk say “God dey,” warin I dey talk be dat na:

“*anything way dey live must be detectable; God nor fit  be detect by man, but God dey – as e be say warin nor dey exist, be dey exit.*” 

E-hen as we dey talk say “God dey,” I don make and stand gidigba. I don show “warin dey exist ” as “ warin nor dey exist”, dis one come dey explain about dis life as something way nor get “life” , or rock as “nor be d same as rock” or as “square” or as a “circle”.

As d same, if I com make something different as in warin “nor dey exist na d same thing as watin dey exist” and confusion na d same as watin dey continue and nor dey stop” and “I say dis thing correct, and “lie na lie” and “watin nor dey equal na d same as watin dey equal” now watin I don do na warin “nor dey correct,” and all d things I put na lie, and talk say dis na place where lie com be com correct."[^2]

Warin dey now, people nor dey make dis “alternate universe” take am to invalidate warin dey right and correct inside our own universe, but na to safe warin be erroneous in reality, and com call am correct. For example nor body dey argue say “God fit dey for different universe, na so if no fit say God nor dey exist” or talk say “ e nor dey for another universe, na so me I nor fit talk say I exist here."

Dem nor if talk say or agree say dat: “ In another universe, u go gree with me say that God nor dey exit, I go talk say u be unbeliever.”[^3]

Na correct talks to say about reality nor get end opposed becos some think say realm called “lie na d same with truth talk” warin nor dey validates dem, den warin be dey self na “nor better talk abouth correct thing na really valid” – however, we know book as dose philosophers by now we don know say the talk dey confusing small, since na better talk to say dat na correct true e b dat means to say nor better talk b true. If something nor be true or lie – even dat talk – dem nor talk at all go fit make anything at all. When u dey use words, like using English, using comprehensible sentence – all of dem nor make sense at all, since in dis “alternative universe”  some structured utterance go fix be something make e no make senses at all. If something way fix be true in dis alternate universe come get effect on talk we make in dis universe, then we go truly know say the universe dey correct, dat is to say dat nor statements can ever fix make about anything, since dere exact opposite can be d same as true

D true reality of d statement be say “something way nor correct na d same with something way correct” is d tautological dey kolo of “null be d same as null”.

### The "Alternate Universe" In Human Society

D reason why we dey spend so much time dey hammer on dis “alternate universe” theory is dat it has direct relevance to where people dey live, and is used to “justify d greatest bad thing way dey committed among we people.

Warin we don see b/4, we know say to kpai no good at all. As we dey waka through d proposition dat kpai is totally not good at all in d above example, I strongly get am for mind dat any person go dey shocked to have their character/behavior instincts correct through d strict abstract reasoning of UPB. In dis part, however, e go be special permission for u to start to b truly stocked.  

D ogboge leaps for front in scientific watin get sense na d so-called “unifying theories. “Einstein spent plenty year com work  out a unified field theory; and theories of physics which com gather together ogboge and lazy forces, electromagnetism, gravity and so on remain elusive.

UPB way b framework, however, nor come believe our character inside us at d personal, philosophical and universal levels – but e com profound and shocking implications for where people dey live together. 

#### UPB In Action

D UPB framework com check character matching by asking dem dat dey be internally consistent, and universal in terms of time, place and individual.

If we com agree with UPB, we go also com agree d following corollary:

-  Behavior propositions are free of costume.

Warin dis one com mean be dat man no go fix change his behavior natural by d shirt e dey wear. D way to change person cloth no go fix change person look as him carry com for earth. To dey fight with character way get laws no go if make d cloth dat u dey wear change any thing at all.  

Soldier who be government people way dey stand for road dey carry stick, of course, wear their color cloths way no be d same as people who nor dey work for government. Dose people who nor join soldier cannot kpai; solders, however, dem nor get power to kpai any person but dem go still dey priased dem for kpaing.

Make we yam  about another example.

Theft na dose people way dey go steal other people things e nor good at all, as we don talk am for up there. E no good for every people who dey for situation all the times and under all circumstance. Since to thief somebody thing be say u dey take something by force from somebody hand or house and d person nor know or agree, then taxation is always, universally and nor good at all. Taxation come be like say dem dey by force dey collect person thing way d person nor know or agree, since taxation com rest on d initiation of to take force collect person property. 

As we dey call “government” na just another example of dis null zone where dey go say something way dey up na down, black na white, truth na lie and bad thing na good thing

Where things dey happen na d degree dat reason and evidence go make big thing leap from d personal to d universal, and com scatter any irrational null zones na d way. Where Science com make thing happen exactly to d degree dat dey nor agree d irrationality of God and subjective “absolutes.” Dose people who dey make medicine to d extend dat dey rejects d power of prayer and empty native juju, and instead believe say na their on studies and evidence beta or good pass. Philosophy also – and place where human being dey live and gather – will get and grow up high dat e nor agree with d irrational “square-circle character or behavior” of statist and religion ethical theories.

### Government

Dey are talking say dat d government work under opposite character rules way different from other community na d same thing we dey talk say “leprechauns are immune to gravity. “Frist of all, leprechauns nor dey exit – and one of d way which we go know say dem nor dey exist na by d thing dem dey claimed say dat dey are immune to gravity. Everything dat get weight na subject to gravity – dat one na immune to gravity by definition na e nor get mass, and d thing nor dey exist. D talk way dey ground “leprechauns are immune to gravity” na a tautology, dis one only com be true say na d non-existence of leprechauns – dis one com b d semantic equivalent of “dat which nor dey exist, nor dey exist.” A na A, Aristotle’s first law of logic, does precious little to confirm d existence of dat which is defined as non-existence.     

for de same way, wen we dey talk say e dey gud for soldiers dem to dey kill and government people to dey steal, we sabi say soldiers and government people wen e come to do gud dem no de dey active. 
if i talk say square circle don get him rite to steal, wetin i dey try talk now be say wetin no exist get him right to do wetin dey against him own body. But dat one na pure mumu talk, but wetin de get anyhow attention for de ''null zone'' politics.

If now i go buy second hand soldier uniform for store, den i cum carry am wear am for my body, dat one don dey clear say i no create anoda universe wey opposite betta law for de follow dey valid. de time wey i for de carry wear de costume, e bin dey wrong give me say i kill- wen e go come de right say make i kill? abi na wen i wear my trousers? wetin go come happen say  if i wear my trousers but i no come wear my top? what if na only one boot i dey wear? what if na de two boot i dey wear, but one de laced, what if i dey wear my own cap backward, wetin go happen if i come wear uniform wey no dey recognise give anybodi wet don see me? Abi de Beatles bin don jus de get him own right to de kill wen dem shot cover for "sergeant Peppers"? Abi dem bin don lose da right wen dem take off dia jackets? ?

I ask these rhetorical questions because they are in fact deadly serious. Clearly, a military costume does not change the nature of a human being, any more than a haircut turns him into a duck, a concept, or a god.

"Ah." you fit even talk say, say dis costume wey you wear don dey invalid because say you get am for second hand store- to wear soldier uniform now no go come make you soldier again as e be say photocopying a doctorate go give you Ph.D."

De comparison no dey correct, because to get Ph.D or to photocopy a doctorate no change any better rules wey you dey subjected to human being wey you be.

“Well,” you fit reply, but de difference be say soldier get better rights wey him get from average citizen, for de sake of collective self-defence and oda things dem.”
Dis de carry beta interesting point, wey be de question say whether opinions fit change reality.
### Opinions And Reality

Clearly, we understand say i no fit through my opinion make e release you commot from restraints of gravity. If e pass my opinion say "two plus two equals five" e make am true.

“Opinions” na dos beliefs wey no get beta evidence for reality, or for wey no clear evidence fit dey provided, or wey be expressions of merely personal preferences. My personal opinion be say dat I prefer chocolate ice cream pass vanilla – I fit get anoda opinion wey be say Iceland na tropical paradise, or say God exists, or say rain dey fall upward. Personal opinions dey clear and e no get anything with morality; opinions wey claim to accurately describe reality, but e no be so, na jus prejudices wey no dey correct. Believe say rain dey fall upward no reverse its course; to wear Hawaiian shirt go Iceland no go make Reykjavik dey warm.

De believe say murder dey morally good no go make murder dey morally good. Since ma beliefs for human being no go change his moral nature, my belief say murders are virtuous no go change the virtue of him actions. If I close my eyes imagine say you be, you no go lose your ability suddenly to regulate ur own bodi temperature. Imagining say you be fish no go bypass your need for scuba gear

Opinions no dey change reality.

Because say opinions no dey change reality, I no fit grant you any exception abi reversal wey dey regard to a universal moral rule. Since moral rules dey based on universal logic, as e take be for physical nature and reality of a human being, I no fit grant you de “right to murder,” or say i fit grant you the ability make you levitate, walk on water or accurately talk say two and two go make five.

### Government As Voluntarism

de open force wey dey involved inside de institution of government – de conceptual wrapper wey dey reverse beta rules for some group of people – na something wey dem no dey table de matter for dabates. Wen we dey talk about government, we dey consider say e no dey make sense to point out "de gun for inside room" for inside definition, governments na wetin dem choose for de people, mak dem dey operate and suggest anyhow dem feel like.

Anyhow, dis na beta nonsense.

If man come carry knife put for woman throat wen him dey get sex wit am, dat one mean say na rape be dat. Him no fit talk say two of dem don agree before dem get sex, dey same time de threatening to injure or kill am if she no gree get sex wit am. if de sex bin dey agreed, de knife no for dey necessary. As the man bin come need knife, then e mean say de sex no bin dey voluntary.

na de same way, people de talk say taxation na part of the social contract wey get dey agreed voluntarily.

Dis na lie both logically and empirically.

We no say e dey empirically false because say*social contract no exists*. not to talk say i sign document voluntary wey concern income tax. – we jus born come enter system wey de take our money from us for gun point.

### De Gun wey dey Room

Plenty people go argue say taxation no be something wey dem force on us like say we dey gun point, but na something wey poeple dey happy dey pay voluntary. AS e be, no tax collector or a policeman don put gun for ma face before, but I don pay tax for years.

This may be true, but it is completely irrelevant. If I tell a woman that I will kill her children if she does not have sex with me, and she submits herself to me, we clearly understand that an immoral action has taken place – even though I have used no weapon in my violation. Clearly, if the woman submits to me, it is because she fears that I will carry out my threat. If I told her that my pet leprechaun will kill her children if she does not have sex with me, she would very likely be disturbed, but would not fear my threat in any significant way, since it is impossible for my pet leprechaun to kill her children. Or, if I died, and my will stated that I would kill this woman’s children if she did not have sex with me, clearly she would feel relieved rather than afraid, since I cannot conceivably act out my threat from beyond the grave. Thus we pay taxes because we know that if we do not, the likelihood of being aggressed against by representatives of the state is very high. If I do not pay my taxes, I will get a letter, then another letter, then a phone call, then a summons to court – and if I do not appear in court, or do not pay my back taxes and accumulated fines and interest, policemen will come with guns to take me to jail. If I resist those policemen, they will shoot me down.

To say that force equals voluntarism is completely illogical and self-contradictory. To say that the initiation of the use of force is completely equal to the non-initiation of the use of force is to say that up is down, black is white, and truth is falsehood.

Without the “null zone,” these corrupt fictions cannot be sustained.

The “null zone” is the lair of the beast we hunt.

As we can see, we know that personally it is wrong to steal; we have very few problems with an abstract and logical ban on theft, such as we have worked out above – yet still, there exists this “null zone” or alternate universe where such oppositions can be accepted without any question or concern.

According to UPB, it is wrong for me and you to steal. Yet somehow, in this “null zone,” it is not only allowed, but also perfectly *moral*, for others to steal. We *must not* steal – they *must* steal. It is moral madness!

### Policemen

Let us take our good friend Bob away from his little room of moral theory testing and restore him to his original job as a policeman.

Clearly, when Bob wakes up in the morning, before his shift, he cannot go to his neighbour’s house and demand money at the point of a gun, no matter who tells him that it’s all right.

When Bob has his breakfast, he also cannot attack his neighbour and take his money. On his drive to work – even though he has put on his uniform – he has not punched in yet, and thus has no more rights than any other citizen. When he punches in, however, now, as if there descends an amoral pillar of fire from the very heavens, he gains the amazing ability to morally attack his neighbours and take their money.

Strangely, this is the only characteristic of his that has utterly reversed itself. He cannot fly, he cannot change his shape, he cannot successfully digest ball bearings or live in an inferno; he cannot run one thousand kilometres an hour, and neither can he walk through a brick wall. He is absolutely, utterly, and completely *the same man as he was **before** he punched in* – yet now, he is subject to completely opposite moral rules.

Even more strangely, if I am not a “policeman,” but I follow Bob to work, and do exactly what he does – I put on a costume, walk into the police station, and put a piece of cardboard into a punch clock – why, if I then do exactly what Bob does, I am completely and totally immoral, although Bob’s identical actions are completely and totally *moral*.

What kind of sense does this make? How can we conceivably unravel this impenetrable mystery?

The simple fact is that it *cannot* be unravelled, because it is completely deranged. The fact that this “opposite world” moral madness is completely irrational – not to mention violently exploitive – is so obvious that it must be buried in an endless cavalcade of mythological “voluntarism.”

We are told that we “want” Bob to take our money – which completely contradicts the fact that Bob shows up on our doorstep pointing a loaded gun in our face. By this logic, I can also go up and down the street stealing money from my neighbours, and then claim to be utterly shocked when I am arrested:

“They *want* me to take their money!”

“But then why were you threatening to shoot them if they did not give you their money?”

“Because they *owe* me their money!”

“I thought you said that they want to give you their money.”

“No, no – they owe me. It’s really *my* money!”

“On what grounds do they owe you this money?”

“We have a contract!”

“Can you show me this contract? Have they signed this contract of their own free will?”

“It’s not that kind of contract! It’s a – *social* contract… And besides – according to that social contract, I own the whole street anyway – the whole damn neighbourhood in fact! Anyone who refuses to pay me my money can move somewhere else – I’m not forcing anyone!”

“And how do you know that you own the whole neighbourhood? Do you have ownership papers?”

“Yes, of course – have a look here!”

“Well, this is just a handwritten note saying that you own the whole neighbourhood – and it’s the same handwriting as your signature. I’m afraid that we’re going to have to book you – this is just a made-up contract with yourself, which you are inflicting on other people at the point of a gun.”

This is as completely insane and corrupt as me continuing to tell a woman I am raping that she *wants* to have sex with me. Can you imagine if I were on trial for rape, and there was a videotape of the woman begging me to stop, and I had a knife to her throat, how my defence would be received if I continued to insist that she actually *wanted* to have sex with me?

In court, I would be reviled, and thrown into jail for my obvious, mad, corrupt and self-serving hypocrisy.

Ah, but in the “null zone” of government, rape is lovemaking, kidnapping is invitation, rejecting theft is evil selfishness, and coercion is kindness.

This is what I mean when I say that this “opposite world *null zone*” is the most fundamental barrier to human happiness the world over. Stealing is wrong for us; stealing is wrong in the abstract – but stealing is somehow “right” in this insane alternate universe called “government”?

[^2]: Let’s not even get *started* on the logical nightmare of the truth value contained in the statement “error equals truth.”

[^3]: This argument tends also not to work very well with maths teachers – I have never seen a student successfully argue that an incorrect answer may be correct in another universe, and so it is unjust to mark it as wrong.
