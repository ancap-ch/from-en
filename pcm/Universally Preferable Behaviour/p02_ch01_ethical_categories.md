## Ethical Category dem

As we don put UPB framework for im place, we fit conduct examination of how UPB dey validate or invalidate our most common moral proposition dem.  if de theory of physics wey we get fit explain how man fit catch baseball, we don at least pass de first – and de most important – hurdle, and we don throw de beast our first and deepest punch.

### De Seven Category dem

As we don talk before, proposition wey regard universally preferable behaviour fall inside three general category – wey be positive, negative and neutral. for make we fit separate aesthetics from ethics, we go begin to expand de category dem make e encompass any behaviour wey we fit subject to ethical analysis. de seven category dem be:

1. Na gud thing (universally preferable and e dem fit enforce am through violence, such as "No kill anybody")
2. E dey aesthetically positive (universally preferable but dem nor fit use violence enforce am, such as " politeness" and "to dey on time").
3. E dey personally positive ( e nor dey universally preferable and dem nor fit enforce am such as wen love to eat ice cream)
4. E dey neutral, or e nor get ethical or aesthetic content for inside, such as to run go meet bus for park.
5. E dey personally negative (wen person nor like to chop ice cream)
6. E dey aesthetically negative (to dey rude or lateness)
7. na evil thing (universally dem nor like am) 

With de idea, we go fit break dis one down to only two category dem – as we define our ethical proposition dem so dat anytin wey dem ban universally  go just be  mirror image of wetin be universally preferable, and to throw personal preferences and neutral actions one corner cos dem nor dey relevant for ethics mata.

For instance, de Non-Agression principle (NAP) talk say to use force  nor dey moral, – so to nor use force na wetin everybody prefer, while e be say to use force dey universally banned.  If wetin dem don ban na just de opposite of wetin everybody prefer, den we nor need to bring one more  category.

As de tori dey go, as moral philosophers wey we be, we must make our examination of ethics wey make sense priority as we dey focus on top de most egregious violation dem. e clear say de most  immoral action dem na de unjust preference wey dem use violent enforce  ontop oda people. If action dem like theft or murder dey defined just like UPB, den de examination of dis definition dem suppose be we very high priority.

So we go focus our effort on top universally preferable and enforceable action dem.

### Virtue And Im Opposite

de opposite of "Virtue" go be "Vice" de opposite of "gud" go be "evil". If I propose de moral rule wey say " thou shalt not steal", den em mean say 'stealing go be evil thing' nor be  'stealing go be gud thing'. Dis one nore mean say to refrain from theft na de main meaning of moral excellence, na true, since man go fit murder murderer, but im nor fit murder thief. We  fit think am as wetin necessary but e nor dey enough for requirement of virtue.

Every morally preferable action must get opposite action dey dey de same nature – cos if e nor get, den person nor go get choice, no way to avoid am, and so capacity for virtue or vice nor go dey. If I come propose moral rule say "Thou shall not defy gravity", den e clearly say morality nor go dey possible, we nor fit avoid immorality and so my moral rule go be invalid one.

If I propose de moral rule: " thou shall not go to San Francisco", we fit talk dis one anoda way like " thou shall go anywhere except  San Francisco". Na like dis  wey we go fit propose de moral rule "thou shall not steal"  for positive form – "thou shall respect property rights". Since to respect property rights na virtue, den to violate property rights na vice.

### Wetin dey Miss

De virtue wey nor dey for our list na traditional virtue dem like Courage, honesty, integrity and so on – even deir opposite too, cowardice, falsehood and corruption.

E go look like say dis virtue dem suppose dey among aesthetically positive behaviour like to dey on time. personally, but I get too much respect for traditional virtue dem to put dem for de same category with social behaviour dem. Dey wey dem nor fit dey inside de category of universally preferable, na cos as we don talk before, de UPB framework dey only deal with behaviour, e nor dey deal with attitude, thoughts, state of mind, or emotion dem. De scientific method fit process proposition wey make sense. E nor got fit process "anger" or "strong head." Na true say de state of mind nor dey less important – infact dem dey essential – but dem nor fit be part of any objective system wey dem dey use evaluate ethical proposition, since dem dey essentially subjective – and na state of being –wey we nor fit prove.

So UPB go only fit deal with objectively verifiable actions like murder, assault and so on.
