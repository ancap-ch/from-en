## Consistency wey dey internal 

If I be architect, and I submit plan wey dem go use build a house, d first hurdle wey I must pass na weda if dem fit byuild my house or if dem no fit build am rara. If I submit plans wey dey wonderful say make dem use construct house wey be say na soap bubbles dem go use do am, I no fit get any commission, since dat kyn “house” no fit stand.

Similarly, if an engineer submit plan wey dem go use do bridge, d first criterion wey dem must satisfy be say weda d bridge to stand or e no go. Oda considerations lyk shey e go long, aesthethics and dem rest go only apply if d bridge don dey ground ni.

E go dey illogical - make we no mention highly unproductive - to dey build bridge from dem random materials, make we dey use random “calculations”, so dat we fit see if e go stand or e no go stand. Since physical laws dey consistent and e dey universal, e dey relatively easy make we figure out weda d bridge go stand *before* we build am or e no go stand.

Na two ways wey we fit use sabi d viability of d bridge before we build am. D first na to look for d inconsistencies wey dey internal wey dey within d premises and calculations wey support d viability of d bridge. If dem significant errors dey for d calculations wey dey justify d weight wey d bridge fit carry, den d bridge go maybe be over-designed or make im be under-designed. If d mathematical calculations no correct and com giv result for strength wey be minus fifty tons per square foot for any part of d bridge, den for sure e no fit stand - or, if e stand, im viability na just by accident, dem no fit do am again.

D mathematical calculations wey dey support d viability of d bridge must thus dey consistent internally before u fit consider anytin again.

For computer terms, code wey no dey compile dem no fit test am.

Dis na true for d scientific world self. Dem dey check Theories for consistency wey dey internal wella before dem submit am to empirical tests. D reason wey consistency wey dey internal dey essential na since theories dey claim say dem get value relative to reality, and reality dey consistent internally, any theory wey *no* dey consistent internally no fit get value wey dey relative to reality.

Na only *after* d dem don establish d internal consistency of d calculations na im d dem fit review d specifictions wey d bridge reach to one kyn degree. E dey possible make we write d spcifications of d consistency wey dey internal for one pelenge bridge wey be say na balsa wood de use build am finish, but na only if d engineer dey write article for a model rail-roading magazine, im specifications, though e dey consistent, e no go reach any industrial requirement.

Once we don sabi say d bridge go stand, we fit com sabi weda e go meet wetin we nid am for or e no go meet, lyk make e dey support dem people wey dey waka weight versus dem trains.

For dem economics realm, d same criterion na im dem dey use. If ma economic theory nid say make price dey go up and down for d same time, den e no fit be correct, since e no dey possible. Once ma theory don dey checked for consistency wey dey internal, I fit to dey look for evidence, and/or make I start to dey use my theory to dey make proactive predictions.

Thus, we fit say before any theory, go dey correct, e nid d following:

1. Consistency wey dey internal (logic).
2. Consistency wey dey external (fit test am).

Wit dis one for our mind, we fit com look d core subject for dis book.
