## Ethics

Since ethics na subject matter wey all of us get wetin we wan talk already, e dey important to outline the relationship wey dey between *instinctual* ethics and *rational* ethics.

Person wey dey play baseball go fit catch ball wey dey fly even if e nor know physics. For the same way, we go fit smell correctly action wey nor dey moral even if we nor know anything about theories wey dey ethical.

If I fit catch ball wey dey fly, then I get a *feel* wey dey instinctual for the behavior of baseball wey dey fly. My understanding wey dey instinctual nor give me the capacity make I launch spaceship to orbit Jupiter and e go correct. I get “little truth” wey dey immediate – how the ball go move -  but that one no give me the “great truth” wey dey universal – how matter tey dey behave.

For the same way, the moral revulsion wey we get in common for matters wey concern rape and murder nor necessarily dey inaccurate, but dem nor dey give us the capacity to tey create or validate moral theories wey dey consistent and empirical.

If I bring up one scientific theory wey invalidate the power wey baseball player get to take catch ball wey dey fly completely, then I get one big problem to tey explain how the baseball player tey *dey* catch the ball. Also, if my grand theory nor fit predict the arc of ball wey dey fly correctly, then I get a “great truth” wey dey contradict directly a “little truth”, wey  nor fit dey valid. Since the necessity wey dey with logical consistency dey rise from the “little truths” of experience wey dey perpetual, any theory wey dey directly contradict all those kind experience nor fit dey valid.

In another word, na the senses dey make logic dey come out – therefore logic nor fit contradict the evidences wey senses get. Evidence dey always get power pass explanation.

For manner wey dey similar, any ethical theory wey dey valid suppose to fit explain and justify the revulsion wey we get in common for where crime like murder and rape dey. E nor fit contradict the prohibitions wey mankind get universally in a way wey dey reasonable, but e must carry them follow body and explain them correctly.

However, just as Einsteinian physics tey bring out some kind truths wey dey surprising – in fact, e for even get small value if to say those truths *nor* dey surprising – na ethical theories dey bring value wey big pass when dem dey open truths wey dey surprising – even shocking sef. In fact ehn, ethical theories wey nor provide surprising truths go be just ordinary confirmation of instinctual preferences wey don already dey exist and so, the value nor go big.

### The Discipline wey concern Theoretical Ethics

If I talk something wey dey “morally good” – in another word, if I bring theory wey dey ethical – then e clear say I dey argue say human beings *suppose* act for one kind manner, or *nor suppose* to dey act for one kind manner.

If I tell my son say *make* im become baseball player because of say na me want am like that, I nor dey talk moral premise wey dey universal, instead, na preference wey dey personal. E nor dey *moral* if im become the baseball player, and nor be say he go dey *immoral* if im nor gree.

However, if I tell am say e dey *moral* for sons to obey their papa, and *immoral*if then nor obey their papa, then I dey propose one kind preference wey dey universal, instead of make e just dey personal – I dey try to turn one “little truth” (*I want make you become baseball player*) inside one “great truth” (*E dey immoral for sons to dey disobey their papa*). *If* he want make e be moral, e *must* turn to baseball player and nor be because to become baseball player dey moral, but instead, because to dey obey e papa dey moral. 

If I dey talk of preference wey dey universal, I dey really define wetin be *objectively required* or wetin dey *necessary*, say we dey imagine one particular goal. *If* I wan to dey alive, I no need to like jazz, but I *must* eat. To dey eat must always get preference – I no *suppose* to eat the same way wey I tey dey obey gravity – but “eating” dey universal, objective, and na *binding* requirement if you wan stay alive, since e dey rely on facts wey dey biological wey dem nor fit wish comot.

As Ethics be discipline wey dem fit define as theory wey concern human behavior wey dey universal, objective, consistent – and e dey binding. Naturally, behavior wey dey natural go only fit dey binding if the goal dey desired. If I talk say e dey *preferable* for human beings to dey exercise and chop well, I nor dey talk say human beings *nor go* sit down on top couch or to chop potato chips. Wetin I dey talk na say *if* you wan dey healthy, you *suppose* dey exercise and dey chop well.

As Hume popularly point come out, e nor dey possible to get an “ought” from inside an “is”. Wetin e mean by that thing na say that *preference* nor fit come out axiomatically from inside *existence*. Na true say man wey nor dey exercise and wey dey chop poorly go dey unhealthy. That one come mean say e “suppose” to dey exercise and dey chop well? No. The “ought” dey conditional on top the *preference*. If he wan dey healthy, he *suppose* to dey exercise and chop well. Na true say if man nor chop well, he go die – we nor fit get am logically from that fact principle wey dey binding say e *suppose* to eat. *If* he wan dey alive, then im *must* to chop. However, na im get the choice if he go dey alive or not.

The same way, e nor get anything like “better” direction wey dey universal – everything depend on the destination wey dem prefer. If I wan drive go New York from San Francisco, I “suppose” to follow East. If I wan drive enter inside ocean from San Francisco, I “suppose” to follow west. Them nor fit consider both east or west say im “better” pass universally.

Na true say na only very small number of people *dey* drive enter ocean, but that one nor mean say na universally true say nobody *suppose* to drive enter inside ocean. Principles nor dey democratic – or if them dey, we go face the problem of rank subjectivism again and must troway everything wey concern the concept of ethics follow window.

“Behaviour” dey exist for reality wey dey objective, outside our minds – the concepts wey involve “ought”, “should”, and “preference”, nor dey exist outside our minds. But the fact say “ought” nor dey exist inside reality wey dey objective nor mean say “ought” dey subjective completely. Scientific method or numbers themselves, no one wey dey exist inside reality sef, but still science and mathematics na still disciplines wey dey objective.

### Argument wey dey Defeat imself

For us to start our discussion wey concern ethics, e dey very important say make we understand the nature of *arguments wey dey defeat imself*.

For inside economics, no theory go dey valid if e need may price go up and come down the same time. For physics, theory nor go dey valid if e need may gas expand and reduce side by side. For mathematics, theory nor go dey valid if e need may two plus two go give five, since “five” na just another way to tay describe two plus three, no be two plus two, and so if we wan talk say two plus two na five na to talk say five and four na the same thing and that answer don already dey contradict imself.

If we wan look am generally, any theory wey dey contradict imself for utterance nor fit dey valid. E nor need external disproof, since e don already disproof imself. We nor need to examine every corner corner for the universe to tey determine say “square circle” nor dey exist. That particular concept don already contradict imself and therefore e don disprove imself as e even come out for mouth.

If I submit mathematical proof wey dey complex to you, and you notice say for the very beginning, I talk say my proof depend on the fact say two plus two go give four and five at the same time, you nor need to come dey read further to tey know say my proof dey invalid.

In the same way, as I tey talk before, if I waka come meet you, come talk say: “I nor dey exist”, my thesis don destroy imself automatically. If I fit tell you say I nor exist, then e clear say I dey exist.

If I come meet you, and tell you say: “e nor get anything wey dem dey call truth”, then I dey make a statement wey I consider say na true say truth nor dey exist again. Again, my argument don destroy imself.

If I tell you say “Language nor get meaning” then I don also contradict myself. For me to even communicate with you verbally say language dey meaningless, then language suppose at least get small meaning.

If I tell you say “Your senses nor dey valid”, then my argument don already destroy eself, since I dey use your sense of hearing tey dey communicate to you say your sense of hearing nor dey valid. If I fit successfully tell you my thesis, then your sense of hearing dey valid. Therefore, I must assume say your senses dey valid for me to tey convince you say your senses nor dey valid, and e nor fit stand.
