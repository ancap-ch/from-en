## De ojuju

De koko nay make us wan see humanbeign history go be like say we wan bring out the bad side of watin dey happen say the tin nay worst pass for this world na *li lie ethical ways dem*.

If we wan see example like of ethical way  like communism dem,na im be say na im cause people death na im plenty reach about one hundred and seventy human beign dem, we fit talk say de real problem to human beigns no be normal bad criminal dem, but *lie lie good thing ways*. Same thing, the Spanish check check believe say no be thieves and pickpockets dem, but say na priest dem and torturers dem way get mind to help the life of other people. Nazism dem too believe say some good thing ways na im follow the matter of human beign and the join-join, and de good thing harsh thing to obey our oga dem, even ways to "show say" the real good side of the Aryan people dem.

plenty times, since we be human beign, we don see say de tin way bad pass for man hand no be gun, or even bomb dem, or knive dem, or poison dem, but instead e kom b *good thing ways*. since de “spiritual right of king dem” to de no bus-stop right for bad peope new democracies dem, from our ancestor na im serve of some kind tin nay follow our village way to de new change to de nation-state dem change am to polictical gragra by a political oga dem, all dose eople way show their pikin de way of spiritual things, e clear say de tin na im bad bad pass way man get na *good thing ways*. e no be science people dem, wey go talk watin day hapen, and tin way go happen,good tin ways no get bus stop of how e go take affect way be think and do to show dem watin dem *suppose* do.

Wen our oga say make we hear dem, no b for dem self as *human beign*, dey talk, but na to do  “the good tin” in general. JFK no talk say: “No ask watin i fit do for you, but ask watin you fit do for me...” Instead, he change the word “your country” for him own self. work  na im  we do for “the country” dem see am as good side – well sha the people wey dey enjoy our work na dose oga dem wey dey do things gra gra. Befor ehn (and sometimes now sef), Ogas say na dem be God, instead of with geography dem, but de rule dem still be dsame. For Communists dem, de real method way show de power of them oga na *levels*; for fascists dem na de *nation*; for Nazis dem na de *type of people*; for democrats dem na “watin de people want”; for priests dem na “watin God want” and e continue like that.

People dem wey get power use good things prove watin dem do with the reason say dem no fit satisfy human beigns to watin dem think say good. If them talk say to work for their ciuntry na “good tin,” then make de work dey for everybody. If we obey military oga dem and dem say na “good side” and “no fear,” dat kind wahala of slavery go continue for everywhere.
### Propaganda dem

De more lie lie good thing way be, e go quick pikin dem learn am. we no look pikin dem as science people wey dem send go“reasoning school dem” from when demdey  three or four years upward. we no see pikin dem as free people of “Capitalism Camp dem” when them reach five years. We no see pikin dem as people wey they think nay dem send go a Rational Empiricism Theme Park dem so them fit trust dem self and follow their mind.

No, anywhere good things way spoil, we go confuse ourselves and dey bad, them they put the bad thing for pikin mind dem as e no strong. De Jesuits people dem get one proverb: “Give me pikin until he reach nine and him go be my own for life,” but dis one na because say de Jesuits people dem they teach watin no be true and lies na im fit kill person. You no fit see science person they force watin him think on small pikin. Imagine person like Richard Dawkins wey talk that tin for up, to show how funny e go dey.

Any good thing person, na im, look ordinarily bad thing, instead of general bad thing na im them support with good thing, no they de matter almost at all, and to work for man upto where them go kill person. doctor na im, dey for the middle of a general and deadly disease, go focus him power to talk to any health person to know watin go happen if de matter go up small, na im dem go think instead of to fear, and e da rare to get watin them go believe for health matter. If your house dey burn, to dey think of de color na im you go take paint your walls fit belike sey u dey commot your mind for better thing to thing wey no make sense for that moment.

secret criminal dem dey, yes na, *but dem no too get impact for our life compared to dose oga ney dey comparable to dose wey rule us for de matter of lie lie good things ways*. Once, when I da eleven years, another boy thief some dollars from me. Another time again, when I da twenty-six years, I forget my ATM card for bank ATM machine, and someone thief a some hundred of dollars from my account.

For de other side of de matter, I get like hundreds of thousands of dollars nay dem collect from me by force through the good thing ways of “taxation dey good.” dem don force me sit down for grim and brain-destroying mental gulags for all dis public schools dem for fourteen years, based on dis good things ways nay “talk say education na good thing.”[^12]

DE boy (and de man) na im thief my money go don use am do some kind enjoyment and personal need for themselves. De government nay thief my money, for the other matter, use am oppress de people ney no get money, to support things for wars, to pay de people na im get money, to borrow money  from people and to make their pikin too get money – and to pay the salaries of dose people nay thief my money too.

If i be doctor for one great city na im one bad disease fall on am, and I find out say de disease fit pass from one person go give another through pipe water, watin go be de better thing i go do – if true true say i really care about the condition of my fellow country people?

Normal i go cry from my roof say de water ney dem dey drink dey cause the disease. Normal i go take every step nay i fit take to make sure say people understand de cause of de disease nay dem they face.

Surely, in the knowledge of such universal and preventable poisoning, I should not waste my time arguing that the true danger you faced was the tiny possibility that some random individual might decide to poison you at some point in the future.

Thus, as a philosopher concerned with violence and immorality, should I focus on private criminals, or public criminals?

The violations that I experienced at the hands of private criminals fade to insignificance relative to even *one day* under the tender mercies of my “virtuous and good masters.”

If, then, the greatest dangers to mankind are false ethical theories, then our highest prioritisation should be the discovery, communication and refinement of a valid, rational, empirical and consistent ethical theory. If we discover that most plague victims are dying from impure water, then surely telling them to purify their water should be our first and highest priority.

Let us now turn to that task.

[^12]: Or, rather: “*forced* education is a virtue” – my parents were compelled to pay through taxes, and I was compelled to attend.
