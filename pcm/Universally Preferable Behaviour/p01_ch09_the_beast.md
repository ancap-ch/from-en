## The ojuju

the koko nay make us wan see humanbeign history go be like say we wan bring out the bad side of watin dey happen say the tin nay worst pass for this world na *li lie ethical ways dem*.

If we wan see exaple like of ethicalway  like communism dem,nay be say na im cause people death nay plenty reach about one hundred and seventy human beign dem, we fit talk say the real problem to human beigns no be normal bad criminal dem, but *lie lie good thing ways*. Same thing, the Spanish check check believe say no be thieves and pickpockets dem, but say na priest dem and torturers dem way get mind to help the life of other people. Nazism dem too believe say some good thing ways nay follow the matter of human beign and the join-join, and the good thing harsh thing to obey our oga dem, even ways to "show say" the real good side of the Aryan people dem.

plenty times, since we be human beign, we don see say the tin way bad pass for man hand no be gun, or even bomb dem, or knive dem, or poison dem, but instead e kom b *good thing ways*. since the “spiritual right of king dem” to the no busstop right for bad peope new democracies dem, from our ancestor nay serve of some kind tin nay follow our village way to the new change to the nation-state dem change am to polictical gragra by a political oga dem, all dose eople way show their pikin the way of spiritual things, e clear say the tin nay bad bad pass way man get na *good thing ways*. e no be science people dem, wey go talk watin day hapen, and tin way go happen,good tin ways no get bus stop of how e go take affect way be think and do to show dem watin dem *suppose* do.

Wen our oga say make we hear dem, no b for dem self as *human beign*, dey talk, but na to do  “the good tin” in general. JFK no talk say: “No ask watin i fit do for you, but ask watin you fit do for me...” Instead, he change the word “your country” for him own self. work  nay  we do for “the country” dem see amas good side – well sha the people wey dey enjoy our work na dose oga dem wey dey do things gra gra. Befor ehn (and sometimes now sef), Ogas say na dem be God, instead of with geography dem, but the rule dem still be dsame. For Communists dem, the real method way show the power of them oga na *levels*; for fascists dem na the *nation*; for Nazis dem na the *type of people*; for democrats dem na “watin the people want”; for priests dem na “watin God want” and e continue like that.

People dem wey get power use good things prove watin dem do with the reason say dem no fit satisfy human beigns to watin dem think say good. If them talk say to work for their ciuntry na “good tin,” then make the work dey for everybody. If we obey military oga dem and dem say na “good side” and “no fear,” dat kind wahala of slavery go continue for everywhere.
### Propaganda dem

the more lie lie good thing way be, e go quick pikin dem learn am. we no look pikin dem as science people wey dem send go“reasoning school dem” from when demdey  three or four years upward. we no see pikin dem as free people of “Capitalism Camp dem” when them reach five years. We no see pikin dem as people wey they think nay dem send go a Rational Empiricism Theme Park dem so them fit trust dem self and follow their mind.

No, anywhere good things way spoil, we go confuse ourselves and dey bad, t them they put the bad thing for pikin mind dem as e no strong. The Jesuits people dem get one proverb: “Give me pikin until he reach nine and himgo be my own forever,” but dis one na because say the Jesuits people dem they teach watin no be true and lies nay fit kill person. You no fit see science person they force watin him think on small pikin. Imagine person like Richard Dawkins wey talk that tin for up, to show how funny e go dey.

Any good thing person, nay, look ordinarily bad thing, instead of general bad thing nay them support with good thing, no they the matter almost at all, and to work for man upto where them go kill person. doctor nay, dey for the middle of a general and deadly disease, go focus him power to talk to any health person to know watin go happen if the matter go up small, na im dem go think instead of to fear, and e da rare to get watin them go believe for health matter. If your house dey burn, to they think of the color nay you go take paint your walls fit be see as shifting your mind for better thing to less important thing.

secret criminal them dey, yes na, *but them no too get impact for our life compared to dose oga nay deh comparable to those who rule us for the matter of lie lie good things ways*. Once, when I da eleven years, another boy thief some dollars from me. Another time again, when I da twenty-six years, I forget my ATM card for bank ATM machine, and someone thief a some hundred of dollars from my account.

For the other side of the matter, I get like hundreds of thousands of dollars nay dem collect from me by force through the good thing ways of “taxation dey good.” them don force me sit down for grim and brain-destroying mental gulags for all this public schools dem for fourteen years, based on this good things ways nay “talk say education na good thing.”[^12]

The boy (and the man) nay thief my money go don use am do some kind enjoyment and personal need for themselves. The government nay thief my money, for the other matter, use am oppress the people nay no get money, to support things for wars, to pay the people nay get money, to borrow money  from people and to make their pikin too get money – and to pay the salaries of those people nay steal my money too.

If i be doctor for one great city nay one bad disease fall on am, and I find out say the disease fit pass fromone person to another through water pipe, watin go be the better thing i go do – if true true say i really care about the condition of my fellow country people?

Normal i go cry from my roof say the water nay dem dey drink they cause the disease. Normal i go take every step nay i fit take to make sure say people understand the cause of the disease nay dem they face.

Surely, in the knowledge of such universal and preventable poisoning, I should not waste my time arguing that the true danger you faced was the tiny possibility that some random individual might decide to poison you at some point in the future.

Thus, as a philosopher concerned with violence and immorality, should I focus on private criminals, or public criminals?

The violations that I experienced at the hands of private criminals fade to insignificance relative to even *one day* under the tender mercies of my “virtuous and good masters.”

If, then, the greatest dangers to mankind are false ethical theories, then our highest prioritisation should be the discovery, communication and refinement of a valid, rational, empirical and consistent ethical theory. If we discover that most plague victims are dying from impure water, then surely telling them to purify their water should be our first and highest priority.

Let us now turn to that task.

[^12]: Or, rather: “*forced* education is a virtue” – my parents were compelled to pay through taxes, and I was compelled to attend.
