### On Ideal Types

History dey deals wit unique and unrepeatable events, wit de irreversible flux of human affairs. A historical event no fit described without de reference to de persons involved and to de place and date of im occurrence. As far as e happening fit be narrated without dis kind a reference, no be a historical event but a fact of de natural sciences. De report wey Professor ::X:: on February 20, 1945, performed a certain experiment for im laboratory na account of a historical event. De physicist believes say im dey right for abstracting from de person of de experimenter and de date and place of de experiment. Im relates only those circumstances wey, for im opinion, dey relevant for de production of de result achieved and, wen repeated, go produce de same result again. Im transforms de historical event into a fact of de empirical natural sciences. Im disregards de active interference of de experimenter and tries to imagine im as an indifferent observer and relater of unadulterated reality. No be de task of praxeology to deal wit de epistemological issues of dis philosophy.

Although unique and unrepeatable, historical events get one common feature: dem be human action. History comprehends dem as human actions; e conceives dia meaning by de instrumentality of praxeological cognition and understands dia meaning in looking at dia individual and unique features. Waitin counts for history dey always de meaning of de men concerned: de meaning wey dem attach to de state of affairs dem want to alter, de meaning dem attach to dia actions, and de meaning dem attach to de effects produced by de actions.

De aspect from which history arranges and assorts de infinite multiplicity of events na dia meaning. De only principle wey im applies for de systemization of im objects--men, ideas, institutions, social entities, and artifacts--na meaning affinity. According to meaning affinity im arranges de elements into ideal types.

Ideal types dey specific notions employed for historical research and for de representation of im results. Dem be concepts of understanding. As such dem dey entirely different from praxeological categories and concepts and from de concepts of de natural sciences. An ideal type no be class concept, because e description does not indicate de marks wey presence definitely and unambiguously determines class membership. An ideal type no fit dey defined: e must be characterized by an enumeration of those features wey presence by and large decides whether for concrete instance we are or are not faced wit a specimen belonging to de ideal type in question. E dey peculiar to de ideal type dat not all im characteristics need to be present for any one example. Whether or not de absence of some characteristics prevents de inclusion of a concrete specimen for de ideal type in question, depends on a relevance judgment by understanding. De ideal type imself na outcome of an understanding of de motives, ideas, and aims of de acting individuals and of de means dem apply.

An ideal type get nothing at all to do wit statistical means and averages. Most of de characteristics concerned no dey open to a numerical determination, and for dis reason alone dem fit no enter into calculation of averages. But de main reason na to be seen for something else. Statistical averages denote de behavior of de members of a class or a type, already constituted by means of a definition or characterization referring to oda marks, wit regard to features not referred to for de definition or characterization. de membership of de class or type must be known before de statistician fit start investigating special features and use de result of dis investigation for de establishment of an average. We fit establish de average age of de United States Senators or we fit reckon averages concerning de behavior of an age class of de population wit regard to a special problem. But e dey logically impossible to make de membership of a class or type depend upon an average.

No historical problem fit be treated without de aid of ideal types. Even wen de historian deals wit an individual person or wit a single event, im no fit avoid referring to ideal types. If im speaks of Napoleon, im must refer to such ideal types as commander, dictator, revolutionary leader; and if im deals wit de French Revolution im must refer to ideal types such as revolution, disintegration of an established regime, anarchy. Im fit be say de reference to an ideal type consists merely in rejecting im applicability to de case in question. But all historical events dey described and interpreted by means of ideal types. De layman too, in dealing wit events of de past or of de future, must always make use of ideal types and unwittingly always does so.

Wheda or not de employment of a definite ideal type dey expedient and conducive to an adequate grasp of phenomena fit only be decided by understanding. No be de ideal type wey determines de mode of understanding; Na de mode of understanding wey requires de construction and use of corresponding ideal types.

De ideal types dey constructed wit de use of ideas and concepts developed by all nonhistorical branches of knowledge. Every cognition of history na, of course, conditioned by de findings of de oda sciences, depends upon dem, and must never contradict dem. But historical knowledge get anoda subject matter and anoda method dan these oda sciences, and dem in turn get no use for understanding. Thus de ideal types must not be confused wit concepts of de nonhistorical sciences. Dis dey valid also wit regard to de praxeological categories and concepts. Dem provide, to be sure, de indispensable mental tools for de study of history. Howeva, dem no refer to de understanding of de unique and individual events wey dem de subject matter of history. An ideal type fit therefore neva be a simple adoption of a praxeological concept.

E happens for many instances dat a term used by praxeology to signify a praxeological concept serves to signify an ideal type for de historian. Den de historian uses one word for de expression of two different thins. Im applies de term sometimes to signify im praxeological connotation, but more often to signify an ideal type. For de latter case de historian attaches to de word a meaning different from im praxeological meaning; he transforms am by transferring am to a different field of inquiry. De economic concept "entrepreneur" belongs to a stratum oda dan de ideal type "entrepreneur" as used by economic history and descriptive economics. (On a third stratum lies de legal term "entrepreneur.") De economic term "entrepreneur" na precisely defined concept which in the framework of a theory of market economy signifies a clearly integrated function.[^21] De historical ideal type "entrepreneur" does not include de same members. Nobody in using it thinks of shoe-shine boys, cab drivers who own their cars, small businessmen, and small farmers. Waitin economics establishes wit regard to entrepreneurs dey rigidly valid for all members of de class witout any regard to temporal and geographical conditions and to de various branches of business. Waitin economic history establishes for im ideal types fit differ according to de particular circumstances of various ages, countries, branches of business, and many other conditions. History get small use for a general ideal type of entrepreneur. E dey more concerned wit such types as: de American entrepreneur of de time of Jefferson, German heavy industries or de age of William II, New England textile manufacturing for de last decades preceding de first World War, de Protestant haute finance of Paris, self-made entrepreneurs, and so on.

Wheda de use of a definite ideal type na to dey recommended or not depends entirely on de mode of understanding. E dey quite common nowadays to employ two ideal types: Left-Wing Parties (Progressives) and Right*Wing Parties (Fascists). De former includes de Western democracies, some Latin American dictatorships, and Russian Bolshevism; de latter Italian Fascism and German Nazism. Dis typification na de outcome of a definite mode of understanding. Anoda mode go contrast Democracy and Dictatorship. Den Russian Bolshevism, Italian Fascism, and German Nazism belong to de ideal type of dictatorial government, and de Western systems to de ideal type of democratic government.

Na de fundamental mistake of de Historical School of Wirtschaftliche Staatswissenshaften for Germany and of Institutionalism for America to interpret economics as de characterization of de behavior of an ideal type, de homo oeconomicus. According to dis doctrine traditional or orthodox economics no dey deal wit de behavior of man as im really be and acts, but wit a fictitious or hypothetical image. Im pictures being driven exclusively by "economic" motives, i.e., solely by de intention of making de greatest possible material or monetary profit. Dis kind being, say these critics, no get and neva did get a counterpart for reality; e dey phantom of a spurious armchair philosophy. No man dey exclusively motivated by de desire to become as rich as possible; plenty no dey are not at all influenced by dis mean craving. E dey vain to refer to dis kind illusory homunculus for dealing wit life and history.

Even if dis really na de meaning of classical economics, de homo oeconomicus go certainly not be an ideal type. De ideal type na not an embodiment of one side or aspect of man's various aims and desires. E dey always de representation of complex phenomena of reality, either of men, of institutions, or of ideologies.

De classical economist sought to explain de formation of prices. Dem been fully aware of de fact say prices no be for product of de activities of a special group of people, but de result of an interplay of all members of de market society. Dis na de meaning of dia statement wey demand and supply determine de formation of prices. Howeva, de classical economists failed for dia endeavors to provide a satisfactory theory of value. Dem been loose to find solution for de apparent paradox of value. Dem been puzzled by de alleged paradox say "gold" dey more highly valued dan "iron," although de latter dey more "useful" dan de former. Thus dem fit no construct a general theory of value and fit no trace back de phenomena of market exchange and of production to dia ultimate sources, de behavior of de consumers. Dis shortcoming forced dem to abandon dia ambitious plan to develop a general theory of human action. Dem get to satisfy demselves wit a theory explaining only de activities of de businessman witout going back to de choices of everybody as de ultimate determinants. Dem dealt only wit de actions of businessmen eager to buy for de cheapest market and to sell for de dearest. De consumer dey left outside de field of dia theorizing. Later de epigones of classical economics explained and justified this insufficiency as an intentional and methodologically necessary procedure. Dem been, asserted, de deliberate design of economists to restrict dia investigations to only one aspect of human endeavor--namely, to de "economic" aspect. Na dia intention to use de fictitious image of a man driven solely by "economic" motives and to neglect all odas although they were fully aware of the fact that real men are driven by many other, "noneconomic" motives. To deal wit these oda motives, one group of these interpreters maintained, no be de task of economics but of oda branches of knowledge. Another group admitted say de treatment of these "noneconomic" motives and dia influence on de formation of prices na task of economics also, but dem believed say e must be left to later generations. E go dey shown at a later stage of our investigations say dis distinction between "economic" and "noneconomic" motives of human action dey untenable.[^22] At dis point e dey only important to realize say dis doctrine of de "economic" side of human action utterly misrepresents de teachings of de classical economists. Dey never intended to do waitin dis doctrine ascribes to dem. Dem want to conceive de real formation of prices--not fictitious prices as dem go be determined if men dey acting under de sway of hypothetical conditions different from those really influencing dem. de prices dem try to explain and do explain--although without tracing dem back to de choices of de consumers--na real market prices. De demand and supply of which dem speak na real factors determined by all motives instigating men to buy or to sell. Waitin dey wrong with dia theory na say dem no fit trace demand back to de choices of de consumers; they lacked a satisfactory theory of demand. But it was not their idea that demand as dem used dis concept for dia dissertations was exclusively determined by "economic" motives as distinguished from "noneconomic" motives. As dem restrict dia theorizing to de actions of businessmen, Dem no deal wit de motives of de ultimate consumers. Nonetheless dia theory of prices dey intended as an explanation of real prices irrespective of de motives and ideas instigating de consumers.

Modern subjective economics starts wit de solution of de apparent paradox of value. E dey neither limits im theorems to de actions of businessmen alone nor deals with a fictitious homo oeconomicus. E treats de inexorable categories of everybody's action. E theorems concerning commodity prices, wage rates, and interest rates refer to all these phenomena witout any regard to de motives causing people to buy or to sell or to abstain from buying or selling. Time done reach to discard entirely any reference to de abortive attempt to justify de shortcoming of older economists through de appeal to de homo oeconomicus phantom.
