### The Scale of Value

Acting man come choose between different opportunities way dey offered for choice. He come prefers one alternative to de others.

Na customary to say dat acting man get a scale of wants or values inside his mind when he come arrange his action. On de basic of such a scale he come satisfies warin na of higher value, i.e., his more dey urgent wants, and come leaves unsatisfied warin na of lower value, i.e., warin come be less of urgent want. Dere na nor objection to such a presentation of de state of affairs. However, one no go fit come forget dat de scale of values or wants come manifests itself only in de reality of action. Dese scales  nor get independent existence apart from de actual character of one persons. De only source from which our knowledge come concerning dese scales na derived na de observation of a man’s actions. Every actions na always in perfect agreement with de scale of valves or wants becos dese scales na nothing but an instrument for de interpretation of warin a man’s dem acting.

Ethical doctrines na intent upon establishing scale of valve according to which man go fit come dem act but no go fit necessary always come dem act. Dey come claim for dem self de vocation of telling warin dey right from wrong and of advising man concerning warin he go aim at as de supreme good. Dey na normative disciplines aiming at de congnition of warin ought to be. Dey na not neutral with regard to facts; dey come judge dem from de point of view of freely adopted standards.

Dis na not de attitude of praxeology and economics. Dey na fully aware of de fact dat de ultimate ends of human action na not open to examination from any absolute standard. Ultimate ends na ultimately given, dey na purely subjective, dey come differ with different people and with de same people at different moments inside dire lives. Praxeology and economics come dey deal with de means for de attainment of ends chosen by de acting one persons. Dey no go fit express any opinion warin come get regard to such problems as whether or not sybaritism na better than asceticism. Dey come apply to de means only one yardstick, through., whether or not dey na suitable to attain de ends at which de acting of one person come aim. 

De notions of abnormality and perversity therefore nor come get place inside economics. E nor come say dat a man na perverse becos he prefers de disagreeable, de detrimental, and de painful to de agreeable, de beneficial, and de pleasant. It come say dat he na different from other people; dat he come likes warin others detect; dat he considers useful warin others people want come  to avoid; dat he come takes pleasure in enduring pain which others come avoid becos e come hurt dem. De polar notions way de normal and perverse go fit be used anthropologically for de distinction between dose who come dey behave as most people do and outsiders and a typical exceptions; dey go fit come applied biologically for de distinction between dose people way  dire behavior preserves de vital forces and dose whose behavior na self-destructive; dey go fit applied in an ethical sense for de distinction between dose who behave correctly and dose who come act otherwise than dey should. However, in de frame of a theoretical  science way dey of dey human action, dere na nor room for such a distinction. Any examination way come dey ultimate ends go turns out to be purely subjective and therefore arbitrary. 

Value na de importance dat acting man come attaches to ultimate ends. Only to ultimate ends na e be primary and original value assigned. Means na valued derivatively according to dire serviceableness come dey contributing to de attainment of ultimate ends. Dire valuation na derived from de valuation of de respective ends. Dey come become important for man only as far as dey come make am dey possible for him to come attain some ends.

 Value na not intrinsic, nor be things. Dey come write am us; na dey way which man come react to de conditions of his environment.

Neither na value in words and doctrines. Na reflected inside human being conduct. Nor be warin a man or groups of men talk about dat counts, but how dey act. De oratory of moralists and de pompousness of party programs na significant as such. But dey come influence de course of human events only as far as dey really come determine de action of men.
