### Action as one Exchange

Action na attempt to substitute state of affairs wey dey more satisfactory for state of affairs wey dey less satisfactory. We dey call dat kin alteration wey dey willfully induced an exchange. One condition wey dey less desirable dey bartered for one wey dey more desirable. Wateva wey dey gratify less dey dey abandoned in order to reach someting wey dey pleases more. Dat ting wey dem abandon an em dem dey call de price wey dem pay for de attainment of the end wey we dey pursue. De value of de price paid, na cost dem dey call am. Cost dey dey equal to de value wey dem attach to de satisfaction wey peson gat forego in order to reach de end wey dem dey pursue.

De difference between de value of de price paid (de cost wey dem incurr) and de goal wey dem attain, na gain or profit or net yield we dey call am. Profit for dis primary sense dey purely subjective, na increase for de happiness of de man wey dey act, na psychical phenomenon wey dem nor fit measur or weigh. More dey and less too dey for de removal of de uneasiness wey dem feel; but na only feel peson fit dey feel how much one peson satisfaction dey surpass another; e nor fit dey established and determined for one objective way. One judgment of value nor dey measure, e dey arrange for scale of degrees, and e dey grade. E dey expressive of one order of preference and sequence, but e nor dey expressive for measure and weight. Na only de ordinal numbers we fit applied to am, but nor be de cardinal numbers.

Na vain to speak of wateva calculation of values. Calculation dey possible only wit cardinal numbers. De difference between de valuation of two states of affairs dey entirely psychical and personal. E nor dey open to any projection for de external world. Na only de individual fit sense am. Dem nor fit communicate or impart am to any fellow man. Na intensive magnitude e be.

Physiology and psychology don develop various methods thru wich dem dey pretend say dem don attain one substitute for de unfeasible measurement of intensive magnitudes. Economics nor need to enter to dey run examination for dis rather questionable makeshifts. Dem supporters themselves dey realize say dem nor dey applicable for value judgments. But even if dem be, dem for nor get any bearing at all on economic problems. For economics deals wit action wey be like dis one, and nor be wit de psychical facts wey dey result in definite actions.

E dey happen all de time say one action nor dey reach de end wey dem dey seek. Sometimes de result, even if e dey inferior to de goal wey dem dey pursue, still be one improvement if we compare wit de previous state of affairs; den one profit still dey, even if say na one wey smalll pass de one wey dem dey expect. But e nor fit happen say dat action produce one state of affairs wey dey less desirable dan de previous state wey dem want am to alter. Den de difference between de valuation of de result and na loss dem de call de cost incurred.
