### Causality as one Requirement for Action

Man dey one position to act because he get de ability to discover causal relations which determine change and to dey become for de universe. To dey act require and presupposes de category of causality. Only one man who see de world for de light of causality dey fitted to act. For dis sense we fit say dat causality na one category of action. Dis kind world go be chaos in which man go be at loss to find any orientation and guidance.  Man nor even dey capable to dey imagine de conditions of such chaotic universe.

Where man nor go see any causal relation, he nor go fit act. Dis statement nor dey reversible. Even when he knows de causal relation involved, man nor go fit act if he nor dey in de position to influence de cause. 

De archetype of causality research na: where and how I go must interfere in order to divert de course of events from de way e go go in de absence of my interference for one direction wey better suit my wishes? For dis sense, man raise de question: who or wetin dey at de bottom of things? He search for de regularity and de “law,” because he want to interfere. Only later nai dis research kon dey extensively interpreted by metaphysics as a search after de ultimate cause of being and existence. Centuries dey needed to bring dis exaggerated and extravagant ideas back again to de more modest question of where one must interfere or make ne dey able to  interfere in order to attain dis or dat end.

De treatment wey dem accord to de problem of causality for de last decade don, due to one confusion wey some eminent physicist bring about,  dey unsatisfactory. We fit hope say dis unpleasant chapter for de history of philosophy go be one warning to future philosophers.

Changes dey wey their cause na, at least for de present time, dey unknown to us. Sometimes we succeed to dey acquire partial knowledge so dat we dey able to say: for 70 percent of all cases ::A:: results in ::B::, for de remaining cases in ::C::,or even in ::D::,::E::, ::F::, and so on. In order to substitute for dis fragmentary information more precise information e go dey necessary to break up A into e elements. As long as dis nor dey achieved, we must acquiensce for wetin dem dey call one statistical law. But dis nor dey affect de praxeological meaning of causality. Total or partial ignorance for some areas nor dey demolish de category of causality. 

De philosophical, epistemoliogical, and metaphysical problems of causality and of imperfect induction dey beyond de scope of praxeology. We must simply establish de fact say in order to act, man must know de causal relationship between events, processes, or states of affairs. And only as far he know dis relationship, e actions go fit attain de ends wey im seek. We dey fully aware say to det assert dis say we dey move for one circle. For de evidence wey we get correctly perceive one causal relation dey provided only by de fact say action guided  by dis knowledge result for de outcome wey dem expect. But we nor go fit avoid dis vicious circular evidence precisely because causality na one category of action. And because na one category, praxelogy nor go fit help to dey bestow some attention on de fundamental problem of philosophy.
