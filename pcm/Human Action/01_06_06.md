### Betting, Gambling, and To Play Game.

Bet na de engagement to risk money or other things against another man on de result of an event about de outcome wey be say we nor go kno pass wetin we suppose kno on de ground of understanding. Thus, people fit bet on top de result of an impending election abi tennis match. Or dem fit bet on top de opinion of people concern de content of a factual assertion dey right and who dey wrong.

Gambling na de engagement to risk money abi oda things against anoda man on top de result of event wey be say we nor pass wetin we suppose know for de ground of knowledge wey concern de whole class.

Sometimes betting and gambling dey combined. De outcome of horse race go  depend on human action-- for de part of de owner of de horse, de trainer, and de jockey-- and ontop nonhuman factors-- de quality of de horse. Most of de people wey dey risk money on de turf na gamblers dem be. But de experts believe say dem know some thing by to understand de people wey dey involved; as far as dis factor dey influence dia decision, dem dey beta. Furthermore, dem dey pretend to know de horse; dem dey make prognosis for de ground of dia knowledge about de behavior of de classes of horses wey dem assign de various competing horse. So far, na gamblers dem be.

Later chapters of dis book go deal with de methods  wey business dey apply if dem wan handle  de problem of uncertainty for future. On dis point  of our reasoning, na only one more observation we must make.

If we follow dis games waka, e fit be ends or means. Na end for people wey dey  yearn for de stimulation and excitement  wey de vicissitudes of a game dey provide dem, abi wey vanity dey flattered by de display of dia skill and superiority if dem wan play game wey require cunning and expertness. Na means for professionals wey wan make money through winning

If dem dey play game, we  fit call am actjon. But e nor dey permissible make we reverse dis statement  and make we call every action a game abi make we deal with all our actions  as if na game dem be. De immediate aim wey dey  to play game na to defeat de partner according  to de rules of  de games. Dis one na peculiar and  special case of acting. Most actions nor dey aim at anybody's defeat abi loss. Dem dey aim at an improvement for condition. E fit happen say dem attain dis improvement for de expense of another man. But dis one nor be de case always. And e nor be de case within de regular operation of a social system wey dey based on division of labor.

De slightest analogy nor dey between to dey play games and to dey conduct business inside market society. person wey dey play cards dey win money by to dey smart pass person wey im dey play against. De businessman dey make money by to dey supply customers wit goods wey dem want get. analogy fit dey between de strategy of person wey dey play card  and person wey be  bluffer. need no dey to investigate dis problem. person wey dey interpret de conduct of business as trickery dey on de wrong path.

De characteristic feature of games na de antagonism of two or more players or groups of players.[^3] de characteristic feature of business wey dey inside society, dat is, inside  order wey dey based on de division of labor, na concord in de endeavors of im members. As soon as dem start to dey get wahala e
wit one anoda, small small, na so dem go seperate.

Inside market economy, competition nor involve antagonism for de sense wey dem carry apply dis to de hostile clash of interests wey no join. e dey true, say  competition sometimes or even everytime fit even come up in de competitors, dose passions of hatred and malice wey dey normally follow de intention of putting evil ontop anoda person. Psychologists dey prone to confuse combat and competition. But praxeology gats dey alert of some kind artificial and misleading difference wey dey between catallactic competition and combat. Competitors dey aim at excellence and preeminence in wetin dem wan get inside system of mutual cooperation. de function of de competition na to assign to every member wey dey social system dat position wey im go fit serve de whole society well and all im members. Na method of selecting de most able man for everything wey dem wan do. For wia social cooperation no dey, e get some kind type of selection wey gats dey applied. Only wia de assignment of different kind of individuals to dem different different kind of work dey effected by de dictator's decisions only and de individuals wey dey concerned nor dey help de dictator by to dey try represent dia own virtues and abilities in de most favorable light, na im competition nor go dey.

we go get to deal with de function of competition later for dis our tori.[^3]  For dis point wey we dey now we must to only put emphasis on top say e dey misleading to apply de terminology of mutual extermination  to de problem of mutual cooperation as e dey work inside one society. Military term nor dey appropriate for de how dem dey describe business waka. na, for example, one kind bad tori to talk about de conquest of market. Conquest nor dey for de fact say one firm dey offer beta or cheap products dan de people wey dey compete with am. Na only for wetin dem call metaphorical sense wey strategy dey for business operations.

[^3]: "patience" or "Solitaire" nor be game fore one person, but na pastime, one kind way to use comot for boredom. E nor represent any pattern for wetin dey happen for one communistic society, as John Von Neumann and Oscar Morgenstern (Theory Of Games and Economic Behavior [Princeton, 1944], p. 86) assert.
