### Conception and Understanding

De task of de sciences of human action na de comprehension of de meaning and relevance of uman action. Dem apply for dis purpose two different epistemological procedures: conception and understanding. Conception na de mental tool of praxeology; understanding na de specific mental tool of history.

De cognition of praxeology na conceptual cognition. E refers to waitin dey necessary for human action. E dey cognition of universals and categories.

De cognition of history dey refer to waiting dey unique and each person for each event or class of events. E analyzes first each object of im studies wit de help of de mental tools provided by all oda sciences. Having achieved dis preliminary work, e face im own specific problem; de elucidation of de unique and individual features of de case by means of de understanding.

As dem mentioned above, e done asserted say history fit bever be scientific because historical understanding depends on de historian’s subjective value judgments. Understanding, e dey maintained, na only euphemistic term for arbitrariness. De writings of historians dey always one-sided and partial; dem no report de facts; dem distort dem.

E dey, of course, a fact say we get historical books wey dem write from different points of view. Histories of Reformation dey written from de Catholic point of view and odas dem write from de Protestant point of view. Dere are “proletarian” histories and “bourgeois” histories, Tory historian and Whig historians; every nation, party, and linguistic group get dia own historians and dia own ideas about history.

But de problem wey dese differences of interpretation offer must not be confused wit de intentional distortion of facts by propagandists and apologists parading as historians. Those facts wey it dey established for unquestionable way on de ground of de source material available must be established as de preliminary work of de historian. Dis not be field for understanding. Na task to be accomplished by de employment of de tools provided by all nonhistorical sciences. De phenomena dey gathered by cautious critical observation of de records available. As far as de theories of de nonhistorical sciences on which de historian grounds dey critical examination of de sources dey reasonably reliable and certain, dere fit be any arbitrary disagreement wit regard to de establishment of de phenomena as such. Waitin a historian asserts dey either correct or contrary to fact, e either proved or disproved by de documents available, or vague because de sources no provide us wit sufficient information. De experts fit disagree, but only on de ground of a reasonable interpretation of de evidence available. De discussion no allow any arbitrary statements.

Howeva, de historians very often no agree wit regard to de teachings of de nonhistorical sciences. Den, of course, disagreement wit regard to de critical examination of de records and to de conclusions to be drawn from dem fit ensue. Unbridgeable conflict come arise. But im cause no be arbitrariness wit regard to de concrete historical phenomenon. Im stems from undecided issue referring to de nonhistorical sciences.

Ancient Chinese historian fit report say de emperor's sin bring about a catastrophic drought and say rain fall again wen de ruler get atoned for im sin. No modern historian go accept dis kind report. De underlying meteorological doctrine dey contrary to uncontested fundamentals of contemporary natural science. But no such unanimity exists in regard to plenty theological, biological, and economic issues. Accordingly historians disagree.

Supporter of de racial doctrine of Nordic-Aryanism go disregard as fabulous and simply unbelievable any report concerning intellectual and moral achievements of "inferior" races. He go treat such reports in de same way for all modern historians deal wit de above-mentioned Chinese report. No agreement wit regard to any phenomenon of de history of Christianity fit be attained between people for whom de gospels dey Holy Writ and people for whose eyes dem be human documents. Catholic and Protestant historians disagree about plenty questions of fact because dem start from different theological ideas. Mercantilist or Neo-Mercantilist must necessarily dey for variance wit an economist. De account of German monetary history in de years 1914 to 1923 dey conditioned by de author's monetary doctrines. De facts of de French Revolution dey presented for quite different manner by those who believe in de sacred rights of de anointed king and those who hold oda views.

De historians disagree on dis kind issues not for dia capacity as historians, but or dia application of de nonhistorical sciences to de subject matter of history. Dem disagree as agnostic doctors disagree in regard to de miracles of Lourdes wit de members of de medical committee for de collection of evidence concerning dese miracles. Only those who believe dat facts write dia own story into de tabula rasa of de human mind blame de historians for such differences of opinion. Dem fail to realize say history fit never be studied witout presuppositions, and dat dissension wit regard to de presuppositions, i.e., de whole content of de nonhistorical branches of knowledge, must determine de establishment of historical facts.

These presuppositions also determine the historian's decision concerning the choice of facts to be mentioned and those to be omitted as irrelevant. In searching for the causes of a cow's not giving milk a modern veterinarian will disregard entirely all reports concerning a witch's evil eye; his view would have been different three hundred years ago. In the same way the historian selects from the indefinite multitude of events that preceded the fact he is dealing with those which could have contributed to its emergence--or have delayed it--and neglects those which, according to his grasp of the nonhistorical sciences, could not have influenced it.

Changes for de teachings of de nonhistorical sciences consequently must involve a rewriting of history. Every generation must treat anew de same historical problems because dey appear to am in different light. De theological world view of older times lead to a treatment of history oda dan de theorems of modern natural science. Subjective economics dey produce historical works very different from those based on mercantilist doctrines. As far as divergences for de books of historians stem from these disagreements, dem dey on an outcome of alleged vagueness and precariousness in historical studies. Dem dey, on de contrary, de result of de lack of unanimity for de realm of those oda sciences wey dey popularly called certain and exact.

To avoid any possible misunderstanding e dey expedient to emphasize some further points. De divergences referred to above must not be confused:

1. Wit purposeful ill-intentioned distortion of facts.
2. Wit attempts to justify or to condemn any actions from de legal or moral point of view.
3. Wit de merely incidental insertion of remarks expressing value judgments for de strictly objective representation of de state of affairs. A treatise on bacteriology no loose im objectivity if de author, wey dey accept de human viewpoint, considers de preservation of human life as ultimate end and, applying dis standard, labels effective methods of fighting germs good and fruitless methods bad. Germ wey dey write dis kind book go reverse these judgments, but de material content of im book no go differ from dat of de human bacteriologist. For de same way European historian dealing wit de Mongol invasions of de thirteenth century fit speak of "favorable" and "unfavorable" events because im take de standpoint of de European defenders of Western civilization. But dis approval of one party's standard of value no need necessarily interfere wit de material content of im study. E fit--from de viewpoint of contemporary knowledge--be absolutely objective. A Mongolian historian fit endorse am completely but for such casual remarks.
4. Wit a representation of one party's action for diplomatic or military antagonisms. De clash of conflicting groups fit be dealt wit from de point of view of de ideas, motives, and aims which impelled either side's acts. For full comprehension of waitin happened e dey necessary to take account of wating wan done on both sides. De outcome na de result of de interaction of both parties. But in order to understand dia actions de historian must try to see thins as dem appeared to de acting men for de critical time, no beonly as we wee dem now from de point of view of our present-day knowledge. History of Lincoln's policy for de weeks and months preceding de outbreak of de Civil War is of course incomplete. But no historical study dey complete. Regardless of whether de historian sympathizes wit de Unionists or wit de Confederates or whether im dey absolutely neutral, im fit deal for objective way wit Lincoln's policy for de spring of 1861. Dis kind investigation na indispensable preliminary to answering de broader question of how de Civil War broke out.

Now finally, after we done settle these problems, e dey possible to attack de genuine question: Any subjective element for historical understanding dey, and, if e dey, na for which manner e dey determine de result of historical studies?

As far as de task of understanding dey to establish de facts say people dey motivated by definite value judgments and aimed for definite means, there no fit be any disagreement between true historians, i.e., people intent upon cognition of past events. There may be uncertainty because of the insufficient information provided by the sources available. But this has nothing to do with understanding. It refers to the preliminary work to be achieved by the historian.

But understanding get second task to fulfill. E must appraise de effects and de intensity of de effects wey brought about an action; E must deal wit de relevance of each motive and each action.

Here we dey faced wit one of de main differences between physics and chemistry on de one hand and de sciences of human action on de other. For de realm of physical and chemical events dere exist (or, at least, e dey generally assumed say dem exist) constant relations between magnitudes, and man dey capable of discovering dese constants wit a reasonable degree of precision by means of laboratory experiments. No such constant relations exist for de field of human action outside of physical and chemical technology and therapeutics. For some time economists believed say dem done discovered dis kind constant relation for de effects of changes in de quantity of money upon commodity prices. E dey asserted say rise or fall for de quantity of money in circulation must result in proportional changes of commodity prices. Modern economics get clearly and irrefutably exposed de fallaciousness of dis statement.[^17]

Outside of de field of economic history nobody done ever ventured to maintain say constant relations prevail for human history. Na fact say for de armed conflicts fought for de past between Europeans and backward peoples of oda races, one European soldier was usually a match for several native fighters. But nobody fit ever foolish enough to "measure" de magnitude of European superiority.

D impracticability of measurement is not due to the lack of technical methods for the establishment of measure. Na due to de absence of constant relations. If e dey only caused by technical insufficiency, at least an approximate estimation go dey possible for some cases. But de main fact na say constant relations no dey. Economics no dey, as ignorant positivists repeat again and again, backward because e no dey "quantitative." E no dey quantitative and e no measure because dem no dey constants. Statistical figures referring to economic events dey historical data. Dem tell us waitin happened if a nonrepeatable historical case. Physical events can be interpreted on the ground of our knowledge concerning constant relations established by experiments. Historical events no dey open to such an interpretation.

De historian fit enumerate all de factors wey cooperated for bringing about de known effect and all de factors wey work against dem and fit get resulted for delaying and mitigating de final outcome. But im no fit coordinate, except by understanding, de diferent causative factors for quantitative way to de effects produced. Im no fit, except by understanding, assign to each of ::n:: factors im role for producing de effect ::P::. Understanding for de realm of history de equivalent, as e dey, of quantitative analysis and measurement.

Technology fit tell us how thick steel plate must be in order for am not to be pierced by bullet fired at a distance of 300 yards from a Winchester rifle. E fit be thus answer de question why man wey take shelter behind a steel plate of a known thickness come wound or im no wound by shot fired. History dey im loss to explain wit de same assurance why there dem be rise for de price of milk of 10 per cent or why President Roosevelt defeated Governor Dewey for de election of 1944 or why France come from 1870 to 1940 under a republican constitution. Dis kind problems no dey allow any treatment oda dan dat of understanding.

To every bodi wey be historical factor understanding tries to assign dey relevance. For de exercise of understanding there room no dey for arbitrariness and capriciousness. De freedom of de historian dey limited by im endeavor to provide a satisfactory explanation of reality. Im guiding star must be de search for truth. But there necessarily enters into understanding an element of subjectivity. De understanding of de historian dey always tinged wit de marks of im personality. E reflects de mind of im author.

The a priori sciences--logic, mathematics, and praxeology--aim at knowledge unconditionally valid for beings endowed wit de logical structure of de human mind. De natural sciences aim at a cognition valid for all those beings wey dem no only endowed wit de faculty of human reason but wit human senses. De uniformity of human logic and sensation bestows upon these branches of knowledge de character of universal validity. Such at least na de principle wey dey guide de study of de physicists. Only for recent years get they begun to see de limits of dia endeavors and, abandoning de excessive pretensions of older physicist, discovered de "uncertainty principle." Dem realize today say there are unobservables whose unobservability na matter of epistemological principle.[^19]

Historical understanding fit never produce results wey must dey accepted by all men. Two historians wey fully agree wit regard to de teachings of de nonhistorical sciences and wit regard to de establishment of de facts as far as dem fit be established without recourse to de understanding of relevance, fit disagree for dia understanding of de relevance of these facts. Dem fit fully agree to establishing say the factors : :, : :, and ::c:: worked together in producing de effect ::P::; nonetheless dem fit widely disagree wit regard to de relevance of de respective contributions of : :, : :, and ::c:: to de final outcome. As far as understanding aims at assigning im relevance to each factor, e dey open to the influence of subjective judgments. Of course, these are not judgments of value, dem no express preferences of de historian. Dem get judgments of relevance.[^20]

Historians fit disagree for various reasons. De  fit hold different views wit regard to de teachings of de nonhistorical sciences; dem fit base their reasoning on a more or less complete familiarity wit de records; dem fit differ for de understanding of de motives and aims of de acting men and of de means applied by dem. All these differences dey open to a settlement by "objective" reasoning; it is possible to reach a universal agreement wit regard to dem. But as far as historians disagree wit regard to judgments of relevance e dey impossible to find a solution which all sane men must accept.

De intellectual methods of science no dey differ in kind from those applied by de common man for im daily mundane reasoning. De scientist use de same tools wey de layman uses; im merely use dem more skillfully and cautiously. Understanding no dey privilege of de historians. E dey everybody's business. For observing de conditions of im environment everybody na historian. Everybody use understanding in dealing wit de uncertainty of future events to which im must adjust im own actions. De distinctive reasoning of de speculator na de understanding of de relevance of de different factors determining future events. And--make we emphasize im even at dis early point of our investigations--action necessarily always aims at future and therefore uncertain conditions and thus dey always speculation. Acting man looks, as im day, with de eyes of a historian into the future.

#### Natural history and Human History

Cosmogony, geology, and de history of biological changes are historical disciplines as dem deal wit unique events of de past. However, dem operate exclusively wit de epistemological methods

of de natural sciences and get no need for understanding. Dem must sometimes take recourse to only approximate estimates of magnitudes. But dis kind estimates no get judgments of relevance. Dem get less perfect method of determining quantitative relations dan im "exact" measurement. Dem must no be confused wit de state of affairs for de field of human action which dey characterized by de absence of constant relations.

If we speak of history, waitin we get for mind na only de history of human action, whose specific mental tool dey understanding.

E dey assertion day modern natural science owes all im achievements to de experimental method dey sometimes assailed by referring to astronomy. Now, modern astronomy dey essentially an application of de physical laws, experimentally discovered on de earth, to de celestial bodies. For earlier days astronomy was mainly based on de assumption say de movements of de celestial bodies no go

change dia course. Copernicus and Kepler simply tried to gues for which kind of curve de earth moves around de sun. As de circle dey considered de "most perfect" curve, Copernicus chose am for im theory. Later, by similar guesswork, Kepler substituted de ellipse for de circle. Only since Newton's discoveries get astronomy become a natural science for de strict sense.
