### How To Grade de Means

De acting man dey transfer de valuation of ends wey im dey aim to de means side.

As oda things dey equal, im go come assign de same value wey im attach to de end to de total amount of de various means wey dem fit bring out. For dat moment we fit argue say de time wey production of de end need and im influence of on top de how de value of de end and of de means take relate.

How dem dey grade de means dey like de one of de ends, just like to prefer :🅰️: to :🅱️:. e dey prefer and e dey set aside. Na de manifestation of de judgement say na :🅰️: wey dem like wella pass :🅱️:. E dey open way to use ordinal numbers, but e nor dey open for cardinal number  and arithmetical operations wey based on top dem. If person ask me to choose one of three ticket, wey be of operas Aida, of Falstaff, and Traviata and I come choose, If na only one I go fit choose, e go be Aida, and if I fit take anoda one e go be, Falstaff, I don make my choice. E means say unda some kind condition  I prefer Aida and Falstaff instead of Traviata; if I fit choose only on of dem, I  go prefer Aida leave Falstaff. If as I choose Aida I call am  :🅰️:, and Falstaff own come be:🅱️: and  Traviata own come be ::c:: , I fit talk say: I prefer :🅰️: to :🅱️: and :🅱️: to ::c::.

Wetin we go gain if we act na say we go get countable and measurable supply of tangible things dem. Den acting ma go get to choose between countable quantity dem wey im like, for example, ::15 r:: to ::7 p::; but if im get to choose between ::15 r:: and ::8 p::, he fit comr prefer ::8 p::. We fit express dis state of affairs if we declare say im value dem ::15 r:: small pass ::8 p::, but high pass ::7 p::. Dis one dey equal with de statement  of say im prefer :🅰️: to :🅱️: and :🅱️: to ::c::. As dem don substitute ::8 p:: for :🅰️:, of ::15 r:: for :🅱️: and of ::7 p:: for ::c:: e nor change de meaning of de statement or de fact wey im dey describe. E nor even allow make reckoning cardinal numbers dem dey possible. E nor dey open de field for economic calculation and de mental operation wey base on top dat kind calculation.
