### De Epistemological Problem of a General Theory of Human Action

For de new science everytin seem to dey problematic. E be stranger for de traditional system of knowledge; people bin dey perplexed and nor know how to classify am and to assign am e proper place. But on de oda hand dem dey convinced say de inclusion of economics in de catalogue of knowledge nor  require a rearrangement or expansion of de total scheme. Dem consider dia catalogue system complete. If economics nor fit into am, de fault fit only rest wit de unsatisfactory treatment wey de economists apply to dia problems.

Na complete misunderstanding of de meaning of de debates concerning de essence, scope, and logical character of economics to dismiss dem as de scholastic quibbling of pedantic professors. Na widespread misconception say while pedants don squander useless talk about de most appropriate method of procedure, economics itself, indifferent to dese idle disputes, go e way quietly. In de *Methodenstreit* betwin de Austrian economists and de Prussian Historical School, de self-styled "intellectual bodyguard of de House of Hohenzollern," and in de discussions between de school of John Bates Clark and American Institutionalism much more bin dey at stake dan de question of which  kind of procedure na de most fruitful one. De real issue come be de epistemological foundations of de science of human action and e logical legitimacy. Starting from  epistemological system to which praxeological tinking bin dey strange and from a logic wey acknowledge as scientific--besides logic and mathematics--only de empirical natural sciences and history, many authors come try deny de value and usefulness of economic theory. Historicism dey aim at replacing am by economic history; positivism recommend de substitution of an illusory social science wey gats adopt de logical structure and pattern of Newtonian mechanics. Both dese schools come agree in a radical rejection of all de achievements of economic thought. E come dey impossible for de economists to keep silent in de face of all dese attacks.

De radicalism of dis wholesale condemnation of economics dey surpassed sharparly by even more universal nihilism. From time immemorial men as dem dey tink, talk, and act don take de uniformity and immutability of de logical structure of de human mind as an unquestionable fact. All scientific inquiry bin  base for dis assumption. For de discussions about de epistemological character of economics, writers, for de first time in human history, deny dis proposition too. Marxism asserts say man tinkin dey determined by e class affiliation. Every social class get logic of e own. De product of thought nor fit be anytin else dan an "ideological disguise" of de selfish class interests of de person wey dey tink am. Na de task of a "sociology of knowledge" to unmask philosophies and scientific theories and to expose dia "ideological" emptiness. Economics na  "bourgeois" makeshift, de economists na "sycophants" of capital. Only de classless society of de socialist utopia go substitute truth for "ideological" lies.

Dis polylogism come later dey taught in various oda forms also. Historicism dey talk say de logical structure of human thought and action dey liable to change for de course of historical evolution. Racial polylogism dey assign to each race a logic of e own. Finally irrationalism dey, contending say reason as such nor dey fit to elucidate de irrational forces wey dey determine human behavior.

Dat kind doctrine dey go far beyond de limits of economics. Dem dey question not only economics and praxeology but all oda human knowledge and human reasoning in general. Dem dey refer to mathematics and physics as well as to economics. E seem as e be so say de task of refuting dem nor fall to any single branch of knowledge but to epistemology and philosophy. Dis dey give shape to apparent justification for de attitude of dose economists wey dey quietly continue dia studies witout bothering about epistemological problems and de objections raised by polylogism and irrationalism. De physicist nor mind if somebody stigmatize e theories as bourgeois, Western or Jewish; for de same way de economist suppose ignore detraction and slander. He gats let de dogs bark and pay no heed to dia yelping. E dey seemly for am to remember Spinoza's dictum: Sane sicut lux se ipsam et tenebras manifestat, sic veritas norma sui et falsi est.

Howeva, de situation nor dey exactly de same wit regard to economics as ie dey wit mathematics and de natural sciences. Polylogism and irrationalism attack praxeology and economics. Altho dem dey formulate dia statements for general way to refer to all branches of knowledge, na de sciences of human action nai dey really get for view. Dey talk say na illusion to believe say scientific research fit achieve results wey dey valid for people of all eras, races, and social classes, and dem dey  take pleasure in disparaging certain physical and biological theories as bourgeois or Western, But if de solution of practical problems requires de application of dese stigmatized doctrines, dem go  forget dia criticism. De technology of Soviet Russia dey use witout scruple all de results of bourgeois physics, chemistry, and biology just as if dem dey valid for all classes. De Nazi engineers and physicians nor disdain to utilize de theories, discoveries, and inventions of people of "inferior" races and nations. De behavior of people of all races, nations, religions, linguistic groups, and social classes clearly prove say dem nor endorse de doctrines of polylogism and irrationalism as far as logic, mathematics, and de natural sciences dey concerned.

But e dey quite different wit praxeology and economics. De main motive for de development of de doctrines of polylogism, historicism, and irrationalism na to provide justification for disregarding de teachings of economics for de determination of economic policies. De socialists, racists, nationalists, and etatists don fail for dia endeavors to refute de theories of de economists and to demonstrate de correctness of dia own spurious doctrines. Na precisely dis frustration nai push dem go negate de logical and epistemological principles wey be de foundation of all human reasoning both for mundane activities and for inside scientific research wey dem do.

E nor dey permissible to dispose of dese objections merely on de ground of de political motives wey dey inspired dem. No scientist dey entitled to assume beforehand say a disapprobation of e theories gats dey unfounded bcos e critics dey imbued by passion and party bias. He dey bound to reply to every censure witout any regard to e underlying motives or e background.e nor dey less impermissible to dey silent for de face of de often asserted opinion say de theorems of economics dey valid only under hypothetical assumptions never realized in life and say dem dey therefore useless for de mental grasp of reality. E dey strange say some schools seem to approve of dis opinion and still dey quietly proceed to draw dia curves and to formulate dia equations. Dem nor dey boda about de meaning of dia reasoning and about e reference to de world of real life and action.

Dis na, of course, untenable attitude. De first task of every scientific inquiry na de exhaustive description and definition of all conditions and assumptions under wey e various statements dey claim validity. Na mistake to set up physics as a model and pattern for economic research. But dose wey dey committed to dis fallacy suppose don  learn one tin at least: say no physicist ever believe say de clarification of some of de assumptions and conditions of physical dey outside de scope of physical research. De main question wey economics dey bound to answer na wetin be de relation of e statements  to de reality of human action wey e mental grasp na de objective of economic studies.

E derefore devolves upon economics to deal thoroughly with de assertion say e teachings dey valid only for de capitalistic system of de shortlived and already vanished liberal period of Western civilization. E dey  incumbent upon no branch of learning oda dan economics to examine all de objections wey don dey raised from various points of view against de usefulness of de statements of economic theory for de elucidation of de problems of human action. De system of economic thought gats dey built up in such a way wey e go be proof against any criticism on de part of irrationalism, historicism, panphysicalism, behaviorism, and all varieties of polylogism. Na intolerable state of affairs say while new arguments dey advance everyday to demonstrate de absurdity and futility of de endeavors of economics, de economists dey pretend to ignore all of dis.

E nor do again to deal wit de economic problems within de traditional framework. E dey necessary to build de theory of catallactics upon de solid foundation of general theory of human action, praxeology. Dis procedure nor go only secure am against many fallacious criticisms but clarify many problems wey before now nor even dey adequately seen, still less satisfactorily solved. Dere dey, especially, de fundamental problem of economic calculation.
