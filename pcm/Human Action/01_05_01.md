### Time as a Praxeological Factor

de belief of somethin wey oyinbo people de call notion de change mean say de belief of sometin wey no go stay but de follow line by line. sometin wey strong ,somethin wey go last for ever for this world no go get time again for this world,but e fit be die.de style way e go take change and de time na sometin wey person no feat change as them both join together.somethin wey person do wey feat carry am go change and na somethin wey no go last long.people de reasoning no even get power wey feat make oder people believe say something wey be say enough time no day to leave and enough time no day to do somethin.

person wey de do somethin defferntly from time to time befor de time wey him suppose make am rich,de time wey de person use do de tin , and de time after de person done do de tin finished.de person wey stand on him own with de time wey done pass.

watin oyinbo people de call logic and mathimatics concern with idea and de wey  person de take think.de tin wey join two people together and de result wey person de get after him do something na wathing oyinbo de call coexistent an interdependent.people fit say e good as watin oyinbo de call synchronous or sometin wey no get time.correct person fet do all of them one time.person power to do something na him make sense get power,continue step by step from de one way no too sweet you to the one wey be like say e over sweet you to watin oyinbo people de call cognition.but for de main time wey be say sense get power most confuse de won wey them talk for mouth follow line by line with all part wey oyinbo peopl de call aprioristic deductive systerm.wit that kind of style wit watin oyinbo people d call notions of anteriority an consequence na de metaphorical only.them no de talk anythin wye concern de style, but to de tins wey we done do wey oyinbo people de call grasping .de style him self mean say weder de side of  de person wey sometin happen to.dem get different type of function of between two tin werder na cause or na affect.

e get how you take put weytin oyibo dey call praxeological system arrange am wit logical system take know wer time and causality dey.dat thin wey oyibo dey call praxeological system get one particular principle wey person belief and deduction. as e be say time de pass person na so e be for system. and na one person make be like dat Change. dat thin wey them say now now or later follow join for the praxeological system constituents. e get weytin oyinbo de call Anteriority wey be say life na smal small e follow for vital concept of praxeological reasoning. that one na one thing wey no go ever fit change after e don happen. inside everi everi as praxeological system dey any reference wey get functional correspondence e no follow because dey tin na metaphor and e dey mislead person instead of anteriority and consequence for logical system.

[^1]: as you know say for treatise economics need to dey to put leg inside hot water because say you wan try put mechanics as  exiomatic system for were dey concept and function bench de cause and effect. 
e go later show say axiomatic mechanics no fit solve  as weytin fit repair economic system.
