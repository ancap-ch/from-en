### Time as a Praxeological Factor

d belief of something wah oyinbo people the call notion d change mean say the belief of something way no go stay but the follow line by line. something way strong ,something way go last for ever for this world no go get time again for this world,but e fit be die.d style way e go take change and the time nah something way person no feat change as them both join together.something way person do way feat carry am go change and nah something way no go last long.people the reasoning no even get power way feat make other people believe say something way be say enough time  no day to leave and enough time no day to do something.

person wah the do something defferntly from time to time befor the time way em suppose do ahm rich,d time way the person use do the thing , and the time after the person done do the thing finished.the person way stand on em own with the time way done pass.

watin oyinbo people the call logic and mathimatics concern with idea and the way wah person the take think.d thin way join two people together and the result way person d  get after em do something nah wathing oyinbo d call coexistent an interdependent.people fit say e  good  as watin oyinbo d call synchronous or something way no get time.correct person fet do all of them one time.person power to do something na em make sense get power,continue step by step from the one way no too sweet you to the one way be like say e over sweet you to watin oyinbo people the call cognition.but for d mean time way be say sense get power most confuse the won way them talk for mouth follow line by line with all part way oyinbo peopl the call aprioristic deductive systerm.with that kind of style with watin oyinbo people d call notions of anteriority an consequence nah d metaphorical only.them no  d talk anythin way concern the style, but to the things way we done do way oyinbo people the call grasping .d style em self mean say wader d side of of the person way something happen to.dem get different type of function of between two thing werder nah cause or nah affect.

e get how you take put weytin oyibo dey call praxeological system arrange am wit logical system take know wer time and causality they. dat thin wey oyibo dey call praxeological system get one particular principle wey person belief and deduction. as e b say time the pass person naso e be for system. and na one person make be like that Change. dat thin wey them say now now or laterr follow join for the praxeological system constituents. e get weytin oyibo the call Anteriority wey been say life na jeje e follow for vital concept of praxeological reasoning. that one na one thing wey no go ever fit change after e don happen. inside everi everi as praxeological system dey any reference wey get functional correspondence e no follow because dey thin na metaphor and he dey mislead person instead of anteriority and consequence for logical system.

[^1]: as you know say for treatise economics nid to dey to put leg inside hot water because say you wan try put mechanics as  exiomatic system for were dey concept and function bench the cause and effect. 
e go later show say axiomatic mechanics no fit solve  as weytin fit repair economic system.
