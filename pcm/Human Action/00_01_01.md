### Economics and Praxeology

Economics na de youngest of all sciences. For de last two hundred years, e dey true, many new sciences don emerge from de disciplines familiar to de ancient Greeks. Howeva, wetin happen here na merely dose parts of knowledge wey don already find dia place for de complex of de old system of learning now dey autonomous. De field of study bin dey more nicely subdivided and treated wit new methods; hitherto unnoticed provinces come dey discovered for am, and people come dey  see tins from aspects different from dose of dia precursors. De field itself nor expand. But economics don open to human science a domain previously inaccessible and neva thought of. De discovery of  regularity in de sequence and interdependence of market phenomena bin go beyond de limits of de traditional system of learning. E convey knowledge wey fit dey regarded neither as logic, mathematics, psychology, physics, nor biology.

Philosophers for long don dey eager to ascertain dr ends wey God or Nature dey try to realize for de course of human history. Dem search for de law of mankind destiny and evolution. But even dose tinkers wey dia inquiry bin dey free from any theological tendency fail seriously for dese endeavors bcos dem dey committed to a faulty method. Dem deal  with humanity as a whole or wit oda holistic concepts like nation, race, or church. Dem set up quite arbitrarily de ends wey de behavior of this kind wholes dey bound to lead. But dem nor fit satisfactorily answer de question regarding which factors compelled de various acting individuals to behave in such a way dat de goal aimed at by de whole's inexorable evolution dey attained. Dem bin get recourse to desperate shifts: miraculous interference of de Deity either by revelation or by de delegation of God-sent prophets and consecrated leaders, preestablished harmony, predestination, or de operation of a mystic and fabulous "world soul" or "national soul." Odas spoke of a "cunning of nature" wey implant for man impulses wey dey drive am unwittingly along precisely de path Nature want am to take.

Oda philosophers dey more realistic. Dem nor try to guess de designs of Nature or God. Dem dey look at human things from de viewpoint of government. Dem bin dey intent upon establishing rules of political action, a technique, as e be, of government and statesmanship. Speculative minds come draw ambitious plans for a thorough reform and reconstruction of society. De more modest bin dey satisfied wit a collection and systematization of de data of historical experience. But all bin dey fully convinced say  for de course of social events dat kind regularity and invariance of phenomena nor dey as e don already dey found for de operation of human reasoning and in de sequence of natural phenomena. Dem nor search for de laws of social cooperation bcos dem tink say man fit organize society as he want. If social conditions nor fulfill de wishes of de reformers, if dia utopias dey prove unrealizable, you fit see de fault for de moral failure of man. Social problems bin dey considered as ethical problems. Wetin dey needed in order to construct de ideal society, dem tink, bin good princes and virtuous citizens. Wit righteous men any utopia fit dey realized.

De discovery of de inescapable interdependence of market phenomena come overthrow dis opinion. Bewildered, people come get to face new view of society. Dem learn wit stupefaction say another aspect dey from which human action fit dey be viewed dan dat of good and bad, of fair and unfair, of just and unjust. For de course of social events dere prevail a regularity of phenomena to which man must adjust e actions if he wan succeed. E dey futile to approach social facts wit de attitude of a censor who dey approve or disapprove from de point of view of quite arbitrary standards and subjective judgments of value. Person gats study de laws of human action and social cooperation as de physicist dey study de laws of nature. Human action and social cooperation dey seen as de object of a science of given relations, no longer as a normative discipline of tins wey suppose to be--dis was a revolution of tremendous consequences for knowledge and philosophy as well as for social action.

For more dan a hundred years, howeva, de effects of dis radical change for de methods of reasoning bin dey greatly restricted bcos people believe say dem dey referred only to a narrow segment of de total field of human action, namely, to market phenomena. Dd classical economists meet for de pursuit of dia investigations an obstacle wey dem fail to remove, dd apparent antinomy of value. Dia theory of value bin dey defective, and e force dem to restrict de scope of dia science. Until de late nineteenth century political economy remain as science of de "economic" aspects of human action, a theory of wealth and selfishness. E deal wit human action only to de extent say e dey actuated by wetin bin dey --very unsatisfactorily--described as de profit motive, and e assert say dem dey in addition oda human action wey dia treatment na de task of oda disciplines. De transformation of thought wey de classical economists don initiate bin arrive at e consummation only by modern subjectivist economics, wey convert de theory of market prices into a general theory of human choice.

For a long time men don fail to realize say de transition from de classical theory of value to de subjective theory of value dey much more dan de substitution of a more satisfactory theory of market exchange for a less satisfactory one. De general theory of choice and preference dey go far beyond de horizon wey encompass de scope of economic problems as circumscribed by de economists from Cantillon, Hume, and Adam Smith down to John Stuart Mill. E dey much more dan merely a theory of de "economic side" of human endeavors and of man's striving for commodities and an improvement for e material well-being. Na d science of every kind of human action. Choosing dey determine all human decisions. In making e choice man dey chose not only between various material tins and services. All human values dey offered for option. All ends and all means, both material and ideal issues, de sublime and de base, de noble and de ignoble, dey ranged for a single row and subjected to a decision wey dey pick out one tin and sets aside anoda. Notin wey men aim at or want to avoid remain outside of dis arrangement into a unique scale of gradation and preference. De modern theory of value widens de scientific horizon and enlarges de field of economic studies. Out of de political economy of de classical school dey emerge de general theory of human action, *praxeology*[^1]. De economic or catallactic problems[^2]) dey embedded in a more general science, and nor fit dey any longer  severed from dis connection. No treatment of economic problems proper fit avoid starting from acts of choice; economics go become a part, altho de hitherto best elaborated part, of a more universal science, praxeology.

[^1]: De term *praxeology* bin first dey used for 1890 by Espinas. Cf. his article "Les Origines de law technologies," *Revue Philosophique*, XVth year, XXX, 114-115, and e book come publish for Paris in 1897, wit de same title.

[^2]: De term *Catallactics or the Science of Exchanges* first dey used by Whately. Cf. his book *Introductory Lectures on Political Economy* (London, 1831), p. 6.
