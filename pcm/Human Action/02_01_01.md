### How Human Being Dem dey Cooperate

Society na concerted action, cooperation. Society na de outcome of conscious and purposeful behavior.

Dis one nor mean say individuals don conclude contracts by virtue of how dem find human society. De actions wey bring about social cooperation and daily bring it about anew nor aim at anything else wey pass cooperation and coadjuvancy with other so dem go attain definite singular ends. De total complex of de mutual relations wey dem create with dat kin concerted actions na im dem dey call society. E substitute collaboration for de-- at least conceivable--isolated life of individuals. Society na de division of labor and de combination of labor. For im capacity as acting animal man becomes social animal.

Na for inside socially organized environment dem born individual man. For dis sense alone we fit accept anything say society dey--logically or historically--antecedent to de individual. For every other sense dis dictum dey either empty abi nonsensical. De individual dey live and act within de society. But society na northing but de combination of individuals for cooperative effort. E nor any other place pass de actions of individual man. Na delusion to search for am outside de action of individuals. To speak of a society's autonomous and independent existence, of im life, im soul, and im actions na metaphor wey fit easily lead to crass errors.

De question weda dem go consider society abi individuals as de ultimate end, and whether de interest of de society go dey subordinated to dose of de individuals abi de interests of de individuals to dose of de society dey fruitless. Action na always action of individual men. De social abi societal element na certain orientation of de action of individual men. De category end only make sense if dem apply am to action. Theology and de metaphysics of history fit discuss de ends of society ajd de designs wey God wan realize with regard to de society for de same way wey dem discuss de purpose of all other parts of de created universe. For science, wey dey inseparable from reason, a tool wey dey manifestly unfit for de treatment of dat kin problems, e go dey hopeless make dem embark upon speculation wey concern dese mata.

Inside de frame of social cooperation something fit emerge between members of de society feelings of empathy and a sense of belonging together. Dese feelings na im be de source of man's most delightful and most sublime experiences. Na dem be de most precious adornment of life; dem lift de animal species man to de height of a really human existence. However, as some don assert, dem nor be agents wey bring about social relationships. Na fruits of social cooperation dem be, dem only thrive within im frame; dem nor precede de establishment of social relations and dem nor be de seeds from wey dem spring.

De fundamental facts wey bring about cooperation, society, and civilization and transform de animal man into human being na facts say work wey dem perform under de division of labor dey more productive pass isolated work and say man's reason dey capable of recognising dis truth. But for dese facts men go be deadly foes of one another forever, irreconcilable rivals for dia endeavors to take secure a portion of de scarce supply of means of sustenance wey nature provide. Dem don force each man make dem view all other men as im enemies; im crave for satisfaction of im own appetite go don bring am into implacable conflict with all im neighbors. No sympathy fit develop under dat kin state of affairs.

Some sociologists dem don assert say de original and elementary subjective fact for  society dey "consciousness of kind."[^1]  Others maintain say social systems nor go dey if "sense of community or of belonging together" nor dey.[^2]  One fit agree, provided say dese somewhat vague and ambiguous terms dey correctly interpreted. We fit call consciousness of kind, sense of community, abi sense of belonging together de acknowledgment of de fact  say all other human beings na potential collaborators for Dr struggle for survival cos dem dey capable of recognizing de mutual benefits of cooperation, while de animals lack dis faculty. However, we must not forget de primary fact wey bring about dat kin consciousness abi dat kin sense na de two wey I mention above. For a hypothetical world where de division of labor nor go increase productivity, society nor go dey. Sentiments of benevolence and goodwill nor go dey.

De principle of division of labor na one of de great basic principles of cosmic becoming and evolutionary change. De biologist dey right wen dem borrow de concept of de division of labor from social philosophy and adapting it to dia field of investigation. Division of labor dey between various parts of any living organism. Furthermore, organic entities wey dey collaboration with animal individual dey; e dey customary to call metaphorically dat kin aggregation of ants and bees "animal societies." But one must never forget say  de characteristic feature of human society na purposeful cooperation; society na de outcome of human action, as in, of a conscious wey dey aim at de attainment of ends. Dat kin element nor dey present, as far as we fit ascertain, for de process wey don result in de emergence of de structure-function systems of plant and animal bodies and for de operation of de societies of ants, bees, and hornets. Human society na intellectual and spiritual phenomenon. Na de outcome of purposeful utilization of a universal law wey determine cosmic becoming, viz., De higher productivity of de division of labor. As with every instance of action, de recognition of de laws of nature na im dey put into de service of man's efforts to take improve im conditions.
