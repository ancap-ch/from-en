### Praxeology and History

Na two main branches of de sciences of human actions dey: praxeology and history. History na de collection and systematic arrangement of all de data of experience wey concern human action. E deal with de concrete content of human action. E study all human endeavors in their infinite multiplicity and variety and all person actions with their accidental, special, and particular implications. E scrutinize de ideas wey dey guide men wey dey act and de outcome of de actions wey dem perform. E embrace every aspect of human activities. E be for one hand general history and for de other hand de history of various narrower fields. De history of political and military action dey, of religion, of mores and customs, and of many other realms of human life. De ethnology and anthropology, as far as dem nor be part of biology, and psychology dey as far as e be neither physiology nor epistemology nor philosophy. Linguistics still dey as far as e nor be logic or de physiology of speech[^1].

De subject matter of all historical science na de past. Dem nor go fit teach us anything wey go valid for all human actions, that is for de future too. De study of history makes man to wise and judicious. But e nor by eself provide any knowledge and skill wey go fit be utilized to take handle concrete tasks.

De natural science too deal with past events. Every experience na one experience of something wey pass away; experience of future happenings nor dey. But de experience to which de natural sciences owe all their success na de experience of de experiment for which de individual element of change go fit dey observed for isolation. De facts wey dem amass in dis way go fit be used for induction, one peculiar procedure of interference wey dem do give pragmatic evidence of e expediency, although e satisfactory epistemology characterization na still one unsolved problem.

De experience with which de sciences of human action get to deal na always one experience of complex phenomena. No laboratory experiments go fit dey performed with regard to human action. We never dey in a position to observe de change for one element only, all other complex phenomena nor dey provide us with fact for de sense in which de natural sciences employ dis term to signify isolated events tested in experiments. De information wey e carry by historical experiment nor go fit dey used as building material for de construction of theories and de prediction of future events. Every historical experience dey open to various interpretations, and dey in fact interpreted for many ways.

De postulates of positivism and kindred schools of metaphysics dey therefore illusory. E dey impossible to reform de sciences of human action according to de pattern of physics and de other natural sciences. E no get means to establish one a posteriori theory of human conduct and social events. History go fit neither prove nor disprove any general statement in de manner for which de natural sciences accept or reject one hypothesis on de ground of laboratory experiments. Neither experimental verification or experimental falsification of one general proposition dey possible for e field.

Complex phenomena for de production of which various causal chain dey interlaced nor go fit test any theory. Such phenomena, on de contrary, become intelligible only through one interpretation in terms of theories wey dem don first develop from other sources. In de case on natural phenomena de interpretation of one event must not be at variance with de theories wey dem verify satisfactorily by experiments. In de case of historical events such restriction nor dey. Commentators go dey free to resort to quite arbitrary explanation. Where something dey to explain, de human mind never don been at loss to invent ad hoc some imaginary theories, wey dey lack any logical justification.

For de field of human history one limitation wey similar to dat of de experimentally tested theories enjoin upon de attempts to interpret and elucidate  person physical, chemical, and physiological events dey provided by praxeology. Praxeology na one theoretical and systematic, not one historical, science. E scope na human action as such, irrespective of all environmental, accidental, and individual circumstances of de concrete acts. E cognition na purely formal and general without reference to de material content and de particular feature of de actual case. E aim for knowledge wey valid for all instances wey de condition correspond exactly to those wey dem imply for e assumptions and inferences. Dem nor derive e statement and propositions from experience. Dem be, like those of logic and mathematics, a priori. Dem nor dey subject to verification or falsification on de ground of experience and facts. Dem both be logically and temporally antecedent to any comprehension of historical facts. Dem be one necessary requirement of any intellectual grasp of historical events. Without dem make we nor dey able to see for de course of events anything else than kaleidoscopic change and chaotic muddle.

[^1]: Economic history, deceptive economics, and economic statistics na, of course, history. De term *sociology* dey used in two different meanings. Descriptive sociology deal with those historical phenomena of human action wey nor dey viewed in deceptive economics; e overlaps to some extent de field claim by ethnology and anthropology. General sociology, on de other hand, approach historical experience from one more nearly universal point of view than dat of de other branches of history. History proper, for instance, deal with people or with one certain geographical area. Max Weber for e main treatise (*Wirtschaft und Gesellschaft*[TÃ¼bingen, 1922], pp. 513-600) deal with de town in general, that is, with de whole historical experience wey concern towns without any limitation to historical periods, geographical areas, individual people, nation, races and civilizations.
