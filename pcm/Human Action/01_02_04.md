### The Principle of Methodological Individualism

Praxeology come dey deals with de actions of individual men. Na only inside de further course of its inquiries dat cognition of human cooperation na e dey attained and social action na treated as a special case of de more universal category of de human action as such. 

Dis methodological individualism come dey vehemently attacked  dey various metaphysical schools and disparaged as a nominalistic fallacy. De notion way one person, say de critics, na e come get an empty abstraction. Real man na e come be necessarily always become a member of a social whole. E come dey even impossible to dey imagine de existence of a man go separate himself from de rest of him fellow man and nor come dey connected with de environment where he dey live. Man be man na de product of a social evolution. His most important feature, reason, go fit be only emerge within de framework of social mutuality. Dey nor get thinking warin no depend on de concepts and notions of a collective. But dey talk na manifestly a social phenomenon. Man na always de member of a collective. As de whole na both logically and temporally prior for him parts or members, de study of de individual na posterior to de study of society. De only adequate method way dey for de scientific treatment of human wahala na de way of universalism or collectivism.

Now de problem/argument whether de whole or him parts are logically prior na vain. Logically de notions of a whole and him part are correlative. As logical concepts two of dem come dey different right from time. 

Nor less inappropriate come get regard to our problem na de reference to de antagonism of realism and nominalism, but two of dem dese terms come dey understood for warin e mean which medieval scholasticism come attached to dem. E come be warin nor get contested dat inside de sphere of human action social entities come have real existence. Nor person ventures come to dey talk lie dat nations, states, municipalities, parties, religious communities, na real factors come dey determining de course of human events. Methodological individualism, way come far from dey contesting de significance of such collective wholes, come dey considers am as one of e main works to describe and to dey analyze when dem go come and when dey go  disappear, when dem go change dere structures, and dere operation. And dey come choose de only method to take solve dis problem satisfactorily.

First we must come know dat all de actions b dey performed by just one person. A gather together work must always come go through de intermediary of one or plenty persons  way their actions come dey related to de collective as de secondary source. Na de meaning which de acting persons and all dose who way de thing come touched dem by their action come be attribute to an action, dat come determines its character. Na de meaning come marks one of de action as de action of an individual and anoder action as de action of de state or of de municipality. De hangman, and nor be de state, come executes a criminal. Na de meaning of dose concerned dat discerns inside de hangman’s action of de state. A group of thieves way dey carry gun come occupies a place. Na de meaning of dose who concerned who come imputes dis job/work not on de officers and soldiers on de spot, but to dire nation. If we go fit scrutinize de meaning of de different actions way dey come performed by one persons we must come necessary dey learn everything about de actions of collective wholes. For a social collective nor come get existence and reality outside of de individual member’s actions. De life way dey a collective na lived inside de actions of de one persons constituting e body. Dese na nor social collective conceivable which na not operative inside de actions of some individuals.  De real true way dey social integer come consists inside its directing and come dey releasing e definite actions on de part individuals. Ehen de way to go to a cognition of collective wholes na through an analysis of de one persons’ actions. 

As come dey thinking and acting being man come emerges from his prehumen existence social being. De evolution of come reason, language, and cooperation na de outcome of de warin go be de same process; dey no get separate and necessary warin connect dem together. But dis process come take place inside one persons. E come contain inside charges inside de character of de individuals. Dere na nor other substance inside which e occurred than de one persons. Dere na nor substratum of society other than de actions of one persons. 

Dat dere are nations, states, and churches, dat dere na social cooperation way dey under de division of labor, becomes discernible only inside de actions of certain individuals. Nobody go ever come perceived a nation without come perceiving de peoples inside de nation. In dis sense somebody fit talk say dat a social collective come dey exist through de actions of individuals. Dat nor come mean dat de one person na temporally antecedent. E just come means dat definite actions of one persons constitute de collective.

Dere na nor need to come dey argue whether a collection na de sum way come dey resulting from de additions of its element or more, whether na a being suigeneris, and whether na reasonable or nor come talk of its will, plans, aims, and actions and come to dey attribute to it a distinct “soul.” Such pedantic talk na empty. A collective whole na a particular aspect of de actions of different one persons and as such a real thing come dey determining de course of events.

Na illusory to dey come dey believe dat na possible to visualize collective wholes. Dey nor dey visible; dire cognition na always de outcome of de understanding of de meaning which come make men attribute to dire acts. We fit see a crowd, i.e., a plenty of people. Whether dis plenty people na a mere gathering or a mass (in de sense in which dis term na used in contemporary psychology) or na organized body or any other kind of social entity na de question which go only fit be answered by come understanding de meaning which dey themselves come attach to dire presence. And dis meaning na always de meaning of one persons. Nor be our sense, but our understanding , a mental process, makes us come recognize our social entities.

Dose who want to dey start to dey study of human action from de collective units come encounter an insurmountable wahala inside de fact dat an one person for de same time go fit belong and--with de exception of de most primitive tribes men--really come belongs to various collective entities. De wahala way come raised by de multiplicity of coexisting social units and dire mutual antagonisms go come solved only by methodological individualism [^14].

#### I and We

De ego na de unity of de acting being. Na unquestionably given and no go fit dissolved or conjured away by any reasoning or quibbling. 

De *we* na always de result of a summing up which come puts together two or more egos. If somebody come say I, nor further questioning na necessary in order to establish de meaning. De same na valid with regard to de Thou and, provided de person in view na precisely indicated, with regard to de He. But if man come talk says We. Na always single one persons who come say We; even if dey come talk am in chorus, It come yet remains an utterance of single one persons.

De *We* no go fit act otherwise than each of dem come dey acting on his own behalf. Dey go fit either come act together in accord, or one of dem may come act for dem all. Inside de latter case de cooperation of de others come consist in dire bringing about de situation which come makes one man’s action come dey effective for dem too. Only inside dis sense make de officer of a social entity come act for de whole; one person members of de collective body either come cause or allow a single man’s action to come concern dem too.

De endeavors way dey psychology to take come melt de Ego and to come unmask am as an illusion come dey idle. De praxeological Ego na beyond any doubts. No matter warin a man be before  and warin he go fit become later. In de very act of choosing and acting him na an Ego.

From warin dey plurails logicus (and from de merely ceremonial pluralis majestaticus) we go separate de plurails gloriosus. If a person way from Canada who never tried skating talks, “We be de world’s foremost hockey players, “or if a person from Italic come dey talk with proudly words, “We be de world’s most eminent painters, “nobody na fooled. But come dey reference to political and economic wahala de plurails glorious evolves into de pluralis imperialis and as such come dey plays a significant role inside paving de way for de acceptance of doctrines come dey determining international economic policies.
