### De Instinct of Aggression and Destruction 

E done been assert say man na beast of prey wey im inborn natural instincts impel am to fight, to kill, and to destroy. Civilization, for creating unnatural humanitarian laxity wey alienates man from im animal origin, done tried to quell these impulses and appetites. E done made civilized man a decadent weakling who dey ashamed of im animality and proudly calls im depravity true humaneness. In order to prevent further degeneration of de species man, e dey imperative to free am from de pernicious effects of civilization. For civilization dey merely a cunning invention of inferior men. These underlings are too weak to be a match for the vigorous heroes, they are too cowardly to endure de well-deserved punishment of complete annihilation, and dem be too lazy and too insolent to serve de masters as slaves. Thus dem done resort to a tricky makeshift. Dem done reversed de eternal standards of value, absolutely fixed by de immutable laws of de universe; dem done propagate a morality wey call dia own inferiority virtue and de eminence of de noble heroes vice. Dis moral rebellion of de slaves must be undone by transvaluation of all values. De ethics of de slaves, dis shameful product of de resentment of weaklings, must be entirely discarded; de ethics of de strong or, properly speaking, de nullification of any ethical restriction must be substituted for am. Man must become a worthy scion of im ancestors, de noble beasts of days gone by.

E dey usual to call such doctrines social or sociological Darwinism. We no need decide here whether dis terminology dey appropriate or not. For any rate e dey mistake to assign de epithets evolutionary and biological to teachings wey blithely disparage de whole of mankind's history from de ages for which man begin to lift himself above de purely animal existence of im nonhuman ancestors as e be continuous progression toward de degeneration and decay. Biology no provide any standard for de appraisal of changes dey occur witin living beings oda dan whether or not these changes succeeded for adjusting de individuals to de conditions of dia environment and thereby for improving dia chances in de struggle for survival. Na fact say civilization, if dem judged am from dis point of view, dem need to considered am benefit and no be evil. E done enabled man to hold im own for de struggle against all oda living beings, both de big beasts of prey and de even more pernicious microbes; e done multiplied man's means of sustenance; e done make average man taller, more agile, and more versatile and 4e done stretched im average length of life; e done give man de uncontested mastery of de earth; e done multiplied population figures and raised de standard of living to a level neva dreamed of by de crude cave dwellers of prehistoric ages. E dey true say dis evolution stunted de development of certain knacks and gifts wey once  dey useful in de struggle for survival and done lost dia usefulness under changed conditions. On de oda hand e developed oda talents and skills which are indispensable for life within de frame of society. Howeva, a biological and evolutionary view must not cavil for dis kind changes. For primitive man get fists and pugnacity were as useful as de ability to be clever for arithmetic and to spell correctly dey for modern man. E dey quite arbitrary and certainly contrary to any biological standard to call only those characteristics wey dey useful to primitive man natural and adequate to human nature and to condemn de talents and skills dey badly needed by civilized man as marks of degeneration and biological deterioration. To advise man to return to de physical and intellectual features of im prehistoric ancestors dey more reasonable dan to ask him to renounce him upright gait and to grow a tail again.

E dey noteworthy say de men wey dey foremost for extolling de eminence of de savage impulses of our barbarian forefathers dem so frail say dia bodi for no fit come up to de requirements of "living dangerously." Nietzsche even before im mental breakdown im dey so sickly say de only climate im fit stand na dat of de Engadin valley and of some Italian districts. Im fit no get in a position to accomplish im work if civilized society no get protected im delicate nerves against de roughness of life. De apostles of violence write dia books under de sheltering roof of "bourgeois security" wey dem derided and disparaged. Dem dey free to publish dia incendiary sermons because de liberalism wey dem scorned safeguarded freedom of de press. Dem fit done be desperate if dem done get to forego de blessings of de civilization scorned by dia philosophy. And waitin ade spectacle been say timid writer Georges Sorel, wey go so far for im praise of brutality as to blame de modern system of education for weakening man's inborn tendencies toward im violence![^9]

Person fit admit say or primitive man de propensity for killing and destroying and de disposition for cruelty dey innate. We fit also assume say under de conditions of earlier ages de inclination for aggression and murder dey favorable to de preservation of life. Man dey once a brutal beast. (No need to investigate whether prehistoric man na carnivore or a herbivore.) But person must not forget say im dey physically a weak animal; im fit no dey be a match for de big beasts of prey if im no dey equipped wit a peculiar weapon, reason. De fact say man na reasonable being, say im therefore im yield without inhibitions to every impulse, but arranges im conduct according to reasonable deliberation, must not be called unnatural from zoological point of view. Rational conduct means say man, in face of de fact say im no fit satisfy all im impulses, desires, and appetites, foregoes de satisfaction of those wey im considers less urgent. In order not to endanger de working of social cooperation man dey forced to abstain from satisfying those desires whose satisfaction go hinder de establishment of societal institutions. There is no doubt say dis kind renunciation dey painful. Howeva, man done make im choice. Im done renounced de satisfaction of some desires incompatible wit social life and done given priority to de satisfaction of those im desires wey fit realized only or for a more plentiful way under a system of de division of labor. He done entered upon de way toward civilization, social cooperation, and wealth.

Dis decision no dey irrevocable and final. De choice of de fathers no impair de sons' freedom to choose. Dem fit reverse de resolution. Every day dem fit proceed to de transvaluation of values and prefer barbarism to civilization, or, as some authors say, de soul to de intellect, myths to reason, and violence to peace. But dem must choose. E dey impossible to get things incompatible wit one anoda.

Science, from de point of view of im valuational neutrality, no blame de apostles of de gospel of violence for praising de frenzy of murder and de mad delights of sadism. Value judgments dey subjective, and liberal society grants to everybody de right to express im sentiments freely. Civilization never extirpated de original tendency toward aggression, bloodthirstiness, and cruelty wey characterized primitive man. For plenty civilized men dem dey dormant and burst forth as soon as de restraints developed by civilization give dem way. Remember de unspeakable horrors of de Nazi concentration camps. De newspapers continually dey report abominable crimes manifesting de latent urges toward bestiality. De most popular novels and moving pictures wey those dealing wit bloodshed and violent acts. Bull fights and cock fights attract large crowds.

If author say: de rabble thirst for blood and I wit dem, e fit be no less right dan for asserting dat primitive man too take delight for killing. But e errs if e passes ova de fact say de satisfaction of such sadistic desires impairs de existence of society or if im asserts say "true" civilization and de "good" society dey achievement of people blithely indulging for dia passion for violence, murder, and cruelty, say de repression of de impulses toward brutality endangers mankind's evolution and say substitution of barbarism for humanitarianism say save man from degeneration. De social division of labor and cooperation rests upon conciliatory settlement of disputes. No be war, as Heraclitus say, but peace na de source of all social relations. To man desires oda dan dat for bloodshed dey inborn. If e want satisfy these oda desires, e must forego im urge to kill. He wey want preserve life and health as well and as long as possible, im must realize say respect for oda people's lives and health better serves im aim dan de opposite mode of conduct. One fit regret say dis kind na de state of affairs. But no such lamentations fit alter de hard facts.

E dey useless to censure dis statement by referring to irrationality. All instinctive impulses defy examination by reason because reason deals only wit de means for attaining ends sought and no be wit ultimate ends. But waitin distinguishes man from oda animals dey precisely say im no yield witout any will of im own to de instinctive urge. Man dey use reason in ora to choose between de incompatible satisfactions of conflicting desires.

Person must not tell de masses: Indulge for your urge for murder; e dey genuinely human and best serves your well-being. Person must tell dem: If you satisfy your thirst for blood, you must forego plenty oda desires. You want eat, to drink, to live in fine homes, to clothe yourselves, and thousand oda things wey only society fit provide. You no fit get everything, you must choose. De dangerous life and de frenzy of sadism fit please you, but dem dey incompatible wit de security and plenty wey you no want miss either.

Praxeology as a science no fit encroach upon de individual's right to choose and to act. De final decisions rest wit acting men, no be with de theorists. Science's contribution to life and action no consist in establishing value judgments, but for clarification of de conditions under wey man must act and for elucidation of de effects of various modes of action. E puts at de disposal of acting man all de information e needs in order to make im choice for full awareness of dia consequences. E prepares estimate of cost and yield, as e wdey. E go fail for dis task if e dey to omit from dis statement one of de items wey fit influence people's choices and decisions.

#### Current Misinterpretations of Modern Natural Science, Especially of Darwinism

Some present-day antiliberals, both of de right-wing and of de left-wing variety, base dia teachings ontop misinterpretations of de achievements of modern biology.

##### Men dey unequal

Eighteenth-century liberalism and likewise for present-day egalitarianism start from de "self-evident truth" say "all men dey created equal, and say dem dey endowed by dia Creator wit certain unalienable Rights." Howeva, say de advocates of biological philosophy of society, natural science done demonstrate for irrefutable way say men dey different. There is no room left in the framework of an experimental observation of natural phenomena for such concept as natural rights. Nature dey unfeeling and insensible wit regard to any being's life and happiness. Nature dey iron necessity and regularity. E dey metaphysical nonsense to link together de "slippery" and vague notion of liberty and de unchangeable absolute laws of cosmic orda. Thus de fundamental idea of liberalism dey unmasked as a fallacy.

Now e dey true say de liberal and democratic movement of de eighteenth and nineteenth centuries drew great part of im strength from de doctrine of natural law and de innate imprescriptible rights of de individual. These ideas, dey first developed by ancient philosophy and Jewish theology, dem permeate Christian thinking. Some anti-Catholic sects make dem de focal point of dia political programs. A long line of eminent philosophers substantiated dem. Dem become popular and dey de most powerful moving force or de prodemocratic evolution. Dem dey still supported today. Dia advocates no concern demselves wit de incontestable fact say God or nature no create men equal since dem born many hale and hearty wile odas dey crippled and deformed. Wit dem all differences between men dey due to education, opportunity, and social institutions.

But de teachings of utilitarian philosophy and classical economics get nothing at all to do wit de doctrine of natural right. Wit dem de only point wey matters na social utility. Dem recommend popular government, private property, tolerance, and freedom not because dem dey natural and just, but because dem dey beneficial. De core of Ricardo's philosophy na de demonstration wey social cooperation and division of labor between men wey dey in every regard superior and more efficient and men wey dey in every regard inferior and less efficient dey beneficial to both groups. Bentham, de radical, shouted: "Natural rights na simple nonsense: natural and imprescriptible rights, rhetorical nonsense."[^10] Wit im "de sole object of government ought to be de greatest happiness of de greatest possible number of de community."[^11] Accordingly, for investigating waitin ought to be right e no care about preconceived ideas concerning God's or nature's plans and intentions, foreva hidden to mortal men; e dey intent upon discovering waitin best serves de promotion of human welfare and happiness. Malthus showed say nature in limiting de means of subsistence no dey accord to any living dey right of existence, and say by indulging heedlessly for de natural impulse of proliferation man go neva get risen above de verge of starvation. E contended say human civilization and well-being fit develop only to de extent say man learned to rein im sexual appetites by moral restraint. De Utilitarians no dey combat arbitrary government and privileges because dem dey against natural law but because dem dey detrimental to prosperity. Dem recommend equality under de civil law not because men dey equal but because dis kind policy dey beneficial to de commonweal. For rejecting de illusory notions of natural law and human equality modern biology only repeated waitin de utilitarian champions of liberalism and democracy long before had taught for much more persuasive way. E dey obvious say no biological doctrine fit eva invalidate waitin utilitarian philosophy say about de social utility of democratic government, private property, freedom, and equality under de law.

De present-day prevalence of doctrines approving social disintegration and violent conflict no dey de result of alleged adaptation of social philosophy to de findings of biology but of de almost universal rejection of utilitarian philosophy and economic theory. People get substituted an ideology of irreconcilable class conflict and international conflict for de "orthodox" ideology of de harmony of de rightly understood, i.e., long-run, interests of every bodi, social groups, and nations. Men dey fight one another because dem dey convinced say de extermination and liquidation of adversaries dey de only means of promoting dia own well-being.

##### De social implications of Darwinism

De theory of evolution as dem expounded am by Darwin, say school of social Darwinism, dey clearly demonstrated say for nature no such thing as peace and respect for de lives and welfare of odas. For nature struggle always dey and merciless annihilation of de weak wey no succeed for defending demselves. Liberalism's plans for eternal peace --both for domestic and for foreign relations—dey de outcome of an illusory rationalism contrary to de natural order.

Howeva, de notion of de struggle for existence as Darwin borrowed am from Malthus and applied e dey de theory, dey to be understood for metaphorical sense. Im meaning na say de living being actively resists de forces detrimental to im own life. dis resistance, if e dey succeed, must be appropriate to de environmental conditions in which de being concerned get to hold am own. E no need to always be war of extermination such as for de relations between men and morbific microbes. Reason done demonstrate say, for man, de most adequate means of improving im condition na social cooperation and division of labor. Dem dey man's foremost tool for im struggle for survival. But dem fit work only where peace dey. Wars, civil wars, and revolutions dey detrimental to man's success for de struggle for existence because dem disintegrate de apparatus of social cooperation.

##### Reason and rational behavior called unnatural

Christian theology deprecated de animal functions of man bodi and depicted de "soul" as something outside of all biological phenomena. For excessive reaction against dis philosophy some moderns dey prone to disparage everything in which man differs from oda animals. For dia eyes human reason dey inferior to de animal instincts and impulses; E dey unnatural and diafore bad. Wit dem de terms rationalism and rational behavior get an opprobrious connotation. De perfect man, de real man, na being wey obeys im primordial instincts more dan im reason.

De obvious truth na say reason, man's most characteristic feature, dey also a biological phenomenon. E dey neither more nor less natural dan any oda feature of de species homo sapiens, for instance, de upright gait or de hairless skin.
