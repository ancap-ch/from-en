### Uncertainty and Acting

De uncertainty of de future don already imply de very notion of action. Say man dey act and say de future dey uncertain na two independent matter entirely. Dem just be only two different modes to establish one thing.

We fit assume say de outcome of all de event and changes dey determine uniquely by eternal unchangeable laws wey dey govern becoming and development for de whole universe. We fit consider de necessary connection and interdependence of all de phenomena, i.e., dem causal concatenation, as de fundamental and ultimate fact. We fit entirely discard de notion wey talk say chance dey undetermined. But howeva dat ting fit be, or appear to de mind of one perfect intelligence, de fact remain say man wey dey act, de future dey hidden. If to say man know de future, e for nor get to choose and e nor go act. E go be like automaton, reacting to stimuli without any will of e own.

Some philosopher don prepare to explode de notion say de will of man will na illusion and self-deception becos man gat unwittingly behave according to de inevitable law of causality. Dem fit dey right or wrong from de point of view of de prime mover or de cause of itself. Howeva, from de human point of view action na de ultimate ting. We nor dey assert say man dey "free" to choose and act. We merely dey establish de fact say e dey choose and act and say we dey at a loss to use de methods of de natural sciences to dey answer de question why e dey acts dis way and why e nor dey act de oda way.

Natural science nor dey render de future predictable. E dey makes am possible to foretell de results wey we dey obtain by definite action. But e dey leave two unpredictable spheres: de one wey be of insufficiently known natural phenomena and de one wey be of human acts of choice. Our ignorance wit regard to dis two sphere dey taint all human action wit uncertainty. Na only Apodictic certainty dey within de orbit of de deductive system of aprioristic theory. De most wey we fit attained wit regard to reality na probability.

E nor be de task of praxeology to dey investigate wheda e dey permissible or e nor permissible to dey consider some of de theorems for de empirical natural sciences as certain. Dis problem dey without practical importance for praxeological considerations. Anyhow, de theorems for physics and chemistry get one kin high degree of probability wey be say we fit dey call dem certain for every practical purpose. We fit forecast practically de working of one machine wey dey constructed according to de rules of scientific technology. But de construction of a machine na only one part for de broader program wey aim to supply de consumers wit de products wey com from de machine. Wheda dis na de most appropriate plan or nor be de most appropriate plan depend on de future conditions dey develop and wey we nor fit forecast with certainty at de time of the plan's execution. Thus de degree of certainty wit regard to de technological outcome of de construction of de machine, whateva e fit be, e nor remove de uncertainty inherent for de whole action. We nor go ever fit foretell future needs and valuations, de way wey men dey take react to changes for conditions, future scientific and technological knowledge, future ideologies and policies, wit any great or small degree of probability. Every action dey refer to one unknown future. Na always one kin risky speculation for dis sense.

De problems wey truth and certainty get concern de general theory of human knowledge. De problem wey probability get, for de oda hand, na primary concern for praxeology.
