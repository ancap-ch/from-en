### Class Probability

Class may be means: We come know or we come know, warin come de regard to de problem concerned, everything about de character of a all de class of events or phenomena; but about de actual singular events or phenomena we come know nothing but dat na elements of dis class. 

We come know, for instance, dat dere na ninety tickets in a lottery and dat five of dem dem go draw back. Ehen we come know about de character of de whole class of tickets. But warin get regard to de singular tickets we nor know anything but dat dey na elements of dis class of tickets. 

 We come have a complete table of mortality for a definite period of de past in a definite area. If we come assume dat warin get regard to mortality nor changes will occur, we go fit say dat we come know everything about de mortality of  de whole population way dey in question. But warin get regard to de life expectancy of de one persons we nor come know anything but dat dey na members of dis class of people. 
 
For dis defective knowledge de calculus of probability come dey provides a presentation inside symbols of de mathematical terminology. Na neither expands nor deepens nor complements our knowledge. Na translates na into mathematical language. Na calculations come repeat inside algebraic way come get formulas warin we come know beforehand. Dey no go fit lead to result dat warin go tell us anything about de actual singular events. And, of course, dey nor come add anything to our knowledge way concerning de behavior of de whole class, as dis knowledge come dey already perfect--or come dey considered perfect--at de very outset of warin we dey consider of de matter.

Na a serious mistake to dey believe dat de calculus of probability provides de gambler with any information way go remove or come lessen de risk of gambling. Na, contrary to popular fallacies, come dey quite useless for de gambler, as na any other mode of logical or mathematical reasoning. Na de characteristic way come mark of gambling dat e go fit deals with de unknown, with warin come dey pure chance. De gambler’s hopes for success na not based on substantial considerations. De nonsuperstitious gambler come thinks: “Dere na a slight chance [or’ in other words: na not impossible’] dat fit come win; I come dey ready to come put up de stake come dey asked. I come know very well dat if I come dey  put it up I come dey behaving like person way be fool. But de biggest fools come get de most luck. Anyway!”

Cool reasoning go come show de gambler dat him nor go improve his chance to dey buying two tickets instead na one of a lottery way de total amount of de winnings na smaller than de proceeds from warin dey sell from all de tickets. If him come buy all de tickets, e go fit certainly come lost a part of his outlay. Yet every lottery person way be customer na firmly convinced dat na bêta to buy more tickets than to buy less. De habitués of de casinos and slot machines never come stop. Dey nor go fit give though to de fact dat, becos de ruling odds go come favor de banker over de player, de outcome go come be de more certainly result in warin dey loss for dem de longer dey continue to dey play. De lure of gambling go come consists precisely inside its unpredictability and inside its adventurous vicissitudes.

Make  us come dey assume dat ten tickets, each way come dey bearing de name of a different man, na to dey put into a box. One ticket dey come withdraw am, and de man whose name way dey on it go bears de liable to come pay 100 dollars. Den an person way dey insurer go fit come promise to de person way lose full indemnification if e dey for de position to insure each of de ten for a premium of ten dollars. E go come collect 100 dollars and go come pay de same amount to one of de ten. But fit e go fit insure one only of dem for a rate way dem come fixed by de calculus, he go fit embark not upon an insurance biz, but upon gambling. E go come substitute himself for de insured. E go fit come collect ten dollars and go fit come get de chance either go come keep am or go fit lose dat ten dollars and ninety dollars more.

If a man come promise to pay when anoder man come die a definite sum and charges for dis way come promise de amount adequate to de life way dey come expect as determined by de calculus of maybe, e nor be an insurer but an gambler e be. Insurance, whether dem dey conduct according to biz principle or according to de principle of mutuality, come requires de insurance of a whole class or warin can reasonably come be dey come considered as such. Na basic idea na pooling and distribution warin be risks, not de calculus of maybe. De mathematical operation dat way dey requires na de four elementary operations of arithmetic. De calculus of maybe na mere by-play. 

Dis na clearly evidence by de fact dat de elimination of hazardous way come get risk by pooling go fit also come get effected without any recourse to actuarial methods.  Everything practices na inside his daily life. Every man way dey do biz come includes in his normal cost accounting de compensation for warin losses which dey regularly occur in de conduct of affairs. “Regularly” come means in dis context: De amount way de for dese losses na come known as far de whole class of de different items na concerned. De person way dey deal with fruit go fit come know, for instance, dat one way dey for  every fifty apples go come rotten inside dis stock; but e no go fit know to which one person apple dis will happen. E go fit dey deal with such losses as with other items in de bill of costs.

De definition of de essence of class maybe as come dey given above na de only logically satisfactory one. It come dey avoids de crude circularity implied come dey inside all definitions way come dey referring to de equiprobability of warin dey possible events. Come dey starting dat we nor come know anytin about actual singular events except dat dey get elements of a class de character of which na fully known, dis vicious circle na disposed of. Moreover, na superfluous to dey add a further condition way dem dey called de absence of any regularity inside de sequence of de singular events.

De characteristic way dey mark of insurance na dat it come deal with de whole class of events. As we dey pretend to dey know everytin about de character of de whole class, dere seems to be nor specific risk way come dey involved inside de conduct of de biz.

Neither na dere be any specific risk in de biz of de keeper of a gambling bank or in de enterprise of a lottery. From de point of view of de lottery enterprise de outcome dey predictable, as long as  all dey tickets dem sell all. If some of de tickets come remain way dem nor sell, de enterpriser na in de same position way come get regard to dem as every buyer of a ticket na way come get regard to de tickets way e buy.
