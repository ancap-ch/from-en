### The Praxeological Aspect of Polylogism

An ideology in the Marxian sense of this term is a doctrine which, although erroneous from the point of view of the correct logic of the proletarians, is beneficial to the selfish interests of the class which has developed it. An ideology is objectively vicious, but it furthers the interests of the thinker's class precisely on account of its viciousness. Many Marxians believe that they have proved this tenet by stressing the point that people do not thirst for knowledge only for its own sake. The aim of the scientist is to pave the way for successful action. Theories are always developed with a view to practical application. There are no such things as pure science and the disinterested search for truth.

For the sake of argument we may admit that every effort to attain truth is motivated by considerations of its practical utilization for the attainment of some end. But this does not answer the question why an "ideological"--i.e., a false--theory should render better service than a correct one. The fact that the practical application of a theory results in the outcome predicted on the basis of this theory is universally considered a confirmation of its correctness. It is paradoxical to assert that a vicious theory is from any point of view more useful than a correct one.

Men use firearms. In order to improve these weapons they developed the science of ballistics. But, of course, precisely because they were eager to hunt game and to kill one another, a correct ballistics. A merely "ideological" ballistics would not have been of any use.

For the Marxians the view that scientists labor for knowledge alone is nothing but an "arrogant pretense" of the scientists. Thus they declare that Maxwell was led to his theory of electromagnetic waves by the craving of business for wireless telegraphs.[^6] impelled Maxwell to formulate a correct theory or an ideological superstructure of the selfish class interests of the bourgeoisie. There is no doubt that bacteriological research was instigated not only by the desire to fight contagious diseases, but also by the desire of the producers of wine and of cheese to improve their methods of production. But the result obtained was certainly not "ideological" in the Marxian sense.

What induced Marx to invent his ideology-doctrine was the wish to sap the prestige of economics. He was fully aware of his impotence to refute the objections raised by the economists to the practicability of the socialist schemes. In fact he was so fascinated by the theoretical system of British classical economics that he firmly believed in its impregnability. He either never learned about the doubts that the classical theory of value raised in the minds of judicious scholars, or, if he ever heard of them, he did not comprehend their weight. His own economic ideas are hardly more than a garbled version of Ricardianism. When Jevons and Menger inaugurated a new era of economic thought, his career as an author of economic writings had already come to an end; The first volume of *Das Kapital* had already been published several years previously. Marx's only reaction to the marginal theory of value was that he postponed the publication of the later volumes of his main treatise. They were made accessible to the public only after his death.

In developing the ideology-doctrine Marx exclusively aims at economics and the social philosophy of Utilitarianism. His only intention was to destroy the reputation of economic teachings which he was unable to refute by means of logic and ratiocination. He gave to his doctrine the form of a universal law valid for the whole historical age of social classes because a statement which is applicable only to one individual historical event could not be considered as a law. For the same reasons he did not restrict its validity to economic thought only, but included every branch of knowledge.

The service which bourgeois economics rendered to the bourgeoisie was in Marx's eyes twofold. It aided them first in their fight against feudalism and royal despotism and then later again in their fight against the rising proletarian class. It provided a rational and moral justification for capitalist exploitation. It was, if we want to use a notion developed after Marx's death, a rationalization of the claims of the capitalists.[^8] The capitalists, in their subconsciousness ashamed of the mean greed motivating their own conduct and anxious to avoid social disapproval, encouraged their sycophants, the economists, to proclaim doctrines which could rehabilitate them in public opinion.

Now, recourse to the notion of rationalization provides a psychological description of the incentives which impelled a man or a group of men to formulate a theorem or a whole theory. But it does not predicate anything about the validity or invalidity of the theory advanced. If it is proved that the theory concerned is untenable, the notion of rationalization is a psychological interpretation of the causes which made their authors liable to error. But if we are not in a position to find any fault in the theory advanced, no appeal to the concept of rationalization can possibly explode its validity. If it were true that the economists had in their subconsciousness no design other than that of justifying the unfair claims of the capitalists, their theories could nevertheless be quite correct. Their is no means to expose a faulty theory other than to refute it by discursive reasoning and to substitute a better theory for it. In dealing with the theorem of Pythagoras or with the theory of comparative cost, we are not interested in the psychological factors that impelled Pythagoras and Ricardo to construct these theorems, although these things may be important for the historian and the biographer. For science the only relevant question is whether or not these theorems can stand the test of rational examination. The social or racial background of their authors is beside the point.

Na fact say people in de pursuit of dia selfish interest try to use doctrines wey dey more or less universally accepted by public opinion. Moreover, dem dey eager to invent and to propagate doctrines wey dem fit possibly use to further dia own interests. But dis  nor explain why dat kin doctrine, wey dey favour de interest of a minority and wey dey contrary to de interest of de rest of de people, dey endorsed by public opinion. E nor matter whether dat kin "ideological" doctrine na product of ""false consciousness," wey dey force man make e think unwittingly for manner wey serve de interest of im class, abi whether dem be de product of purposeful distortion of truth, dem must encounter de ideologies of other classed come try to supplant dem. Den a rivalry between antagonistic ideologies go emerge.  De Marxians explain victory and defeat for dat kin conflict as outcome of de interference of historical providence. Geist, de mystical prime mover, dey operate according to definite plan. E lead mankind through various preliminary stages to de final bliss of socialism. Every stage na de product of certain state of technology; all im other characteristics na de necessary superstructure of dis technological state. Geist cause man make e bring about in due time de technological ideas wey dey adequate to de stage wey im live, and to realise dem. All de rest na outgrowth of de state of technology. Na de hand-mill make feudal society; na de steam-mill make capitalism.  [^9] Human go only play ancillary role for dear changes. De inexorable law of historical development force men-- independently of dia own wills- make dem think and behave according to de patterns wey dey corresponding to de material basis of dia age. Men dey fool demsef if dem believe say dem dey free to choose between various ideas and between de thing wey dem dey call truth and error. Dey demsef nor dey think; na historical providence dey manifests imsef for dia thoughts.

Dis na purely mystical doctrine. De only proof wey dem give in im support na de recourse of Hegelian dialectics. Capitalistic private property na de first negation of individual private property. E begets, with de inexorability of law of nature, im own negation , namely common ownership of de means of production.[^10] Na undeniable fact say dere prevails an irreconcilable conflict of interest between dose workers wey dey employed at union wage rate and dose one wey remain unemployed cos de enforcement of union rates prevents de demand for and de supply of labor say make dem nor find de appropriate price for meeting.  It is nor less true say de interest of de workers of de comparatively overpopulated countries and de one of de comparatively underpopulated countries dey antogonistic with regard to migration barriers. De statement say de interest of all proletarians uniformly require de substitution of socialism for capitalism na de arbitrary postulate of Marx and de other socialists. Dem nor fit prove am by mere assertion say de socialist idea na de emanation of proletarian thought and derefore e dey certainly beneficial to de interests of de proletariat like dat.

One popular interpretation of how de British foreign trade dey liable to change, wey base on top de idea of Sismondi, Frederick List, Marx, and de German Historical school, dey like dis: For de second part of de eighteenth century and for big part of de nineteenth century de thing way British bourgeoisie class interest bin require na free trade policy. And so British political economy come set up free trade doctrine,  and de British manufacturers dem come organize one popular movement wey finally succeed to remove protective tariff dem. Den condition come change later. De British bourgeoisie bin nor fit stand again to compete with odas for foreign manufacturing and protective tariff wey people nid hot hot. Na cos of dis one wey economist dem come substitute one theory of protection for de free trade ideology wey dem already know, so Great Britain come return to protectionism.

De first mistake for dis interpretation na say e consider de "bourgeoisie" as one class of de same people wey get de same interest. One businessman go always dey see am as necessary to adjust de conduct of im business make e match de institutional condition of im country. Afta some time wen im go don reach to be entrepreneur and capitalist ,weda tariff dey or not e nor go affecf am. Im go start to dey produce dose commodity wey im go fit produce with profit unda some kind  state affairs. Wetin go affect im short-run interest for good or bad way na changes wey go happen for de institutional setting. But dose kind changes nor dey affect de various branches of business and various enterprises de same way and to de same extent. One way fit benefit one branch or enterprise but  spoil things for anoda branch or enterprise. Wetin business man dey hold hand na just few custom item dem. And as e regard dis item de interest of various branches and firms dem na to end am.

Na all kind of privilege from government wey go fit favour de interest of every branch. But if na de same privilege wey oda firms receive, every business man nor go only lose--as consumer wey dem be but also as buyer of raw materials, half-finished products, machines and oda equipment--for de one hand just as im profit for de oda hand. Selfish group interest go fit make man to ask for protection for im own branch or firm. Dem nor go motivate am to ask for universal protection for all branches or firm dem if im nor sure say im protection go tight pass oda industries or enterprise dia own.

Nor be say British manufacturers sef from how dia class see am been  get interest for de removal of de Corn Laws pass oda British citizen dem. De landowner dem nor agree as dem remove dis law dem cos if dem lower de price of agricultural products e go make rent for land to drop. One special class interest wey de manufacturers get go fit only make sense on top de mata of de tay tay iron law of wages wey dem been remove and de complete  untenable doctrine wey  say profit na outcome of de exploitation of de workers.

For inside world wey dey organised unda de  basis of division of labor, all change must to affect de short-run interest of many groups one way or anoda.It is therefore always easy to expose every doctrine supporting an alteration of existing conditions as an "ideological" disguise of the selfish interests of a special group of people. The main occupation of many present-day authors is such unmasking. Marx did not invent this procedure. It was known long before him. Its most curious manifestation was the attempts of some eighteenth-century writers to explain religious creeds as a fraudulent deception on the part of the priests eager to gain power and wealth both for themselves and for their allies, the exploiters. The Marxians endorsed this statement in labeling religion "opium for the masses."[^12] It never occurred to the supporters of such teachings that where there are selfish interests pro there must necessarily be selfish interests contra too. It is by no means a satisfactory explanation of any event that it favored a special class. The question to be answered is why the rest of the population whose interests it injured did not succeed in frustrating the endeavors of those favored by it.

Every firm and every branch of business is in the short run interested in increased sales of its products. In the long run, however, there prevails a tendency toward an equalization of returns in the various branches of production. If demand for the products of a branch increases and raises profits, more capital flows into it and the competition of the new enterprises cuts down the profits. Returns are by no means higher in the sale of socially detrimental articles than in the sale of socially beneficial articles. If a certain branch of business is outlawed and those engaged in it risk prosecution, penalties, and imprisonment, gross profits must be high enough to compensate for the risks involved. But this does not interfere with the height of net returns.

The rich, the owners of the already operating plants, have no particular class interest in the maintenance of free competition. They are opposed to confiscation and expropriation of their fortunes, but their vested interests are rather in favor of measures preventing newcomers from challenging their position. Those fighting for free enterprise and free competition do not defend the interests of those rich today. They want a free hand left to unknown men who will be the entrepreneurs of tomorrow and whose ingenuity will make the life of coming generations more agreeable. They want the way left open to further economic improvements. They are the spokesmen of material progress.

The nineteenth-century success of free trade ideas was effected by the theories of classical economics. The prestige of these ideas was so great that those whose selfish class interests they hurt could not hinder their endorsements by public opinion and their realization by legislative measures. It is ideas that make history, and not history that makes ideas.

It is useless to argue with mystics and seers. They base their assertions on intuition and are not prepared to submit them to rational examination. The Marxians pretend that what their inner voice proclaims is history's self-revelation. If other people do not hear this voice, it is only a proof that they are not chosen. It is insolence that those groping in darkness dare to contradict the inspired ones. Decency should impel them to creep into a corner and keep silent.

However, science cannot abstain from thinking although it is obvious that it will never succeed in convincing those who dispute the supremacy of reason. Science must emphasize that the appeal to intuition cannot settle the question which of several antagonistic doctrines is the right one and which are wrong. It is an undeniable fact that Marxism is not the only doctrine advanced in our time. There are other "ideologies" besides Marxism. The Marxians assert that the application of these other doctrines would hurt the interests of the many. But the supporters of these doctrines say precisely the same with regard to Marxism.

Of course, the Marxians consider a doctrine vicious if its author's background is not proletarian. But who is proletarian? Doctor Marx, the manufacturer and "exploiter" Engels, and Lenin, the scion of the Russian gentry, were certainly not of proletarian background. But Hitler and Mussolini were genuine proletarians and spent their youth in poverty. The conflict of the Bolsheviks and the Mensheviks or that between Stalin and Trotsky cannot be presented as class conflicts. They were conflicts between various sects of fanatics who called one another traitors.

The essence of Marxian philosophy is this: We are right because we are the spokesmen of the rising proletarian class. Discursive reasoning cannot invalidate our teachings, for they are inspired by the supreme power that determines the destiny of mankind. Our adversaries are wrong because they lack the intuition that guides our minds. It is, of course, not their fault that on account of their class affiliation they are not equipped with the genuine proletarian logic and are blinded by ideologies. The unfathomable decrees of history that have elected us have doomed them. The future is ours.
