### De Praxeological Side of Polylogism

One ideology for de Marxian sense of dis term na doctrine wey dey, although e get error from de point of view  of de correct  logic of de proletarians, dey beneficial to de selfish interests of de class wey develop am. An ideology dey objectively vicious, but e dey further de interest of de class of de thinker precisely in account of im viciousness. Many Marxians believe say dem don prove dis tenet by stressing de point say people nor dey thirst for knowledge only for im own sake. De aim of de scientist na to pave way for successful action. Dem dey always develop theories with view to practical application. Notin dey like pure science and de disinterested search for de truth.

For de sake of argument we fit admit say every effort to attain de truth dey motivated by consideration of im practical utilization for de attainment of some end. But dis nor answer de question why an "ideological" -- as in, a false theory go render service pass de one wey dey correct. De fact say de practical application of a theory results in de outcome wey dey predicted on de basis of dis theory na universally considered confirmation of im correctness. E dey paradoxical make we assert say vicious theory dey from any point of view more useful pass de correct one.

Men dey use firearms. If dem wan improve dis weapon, dem develop the science of ballistics. But, of cos, precisely cos dem dey eager to hunt a game and to kill demsef, a correct ballistics. A merely "ideological" ballistics nor go get any use. 

For de Marxians de view say scientists dey labor for knowledge na northing but "arrogant pretense" of de scientists. Thus, dem declare say dem lead Maxwell to im theory of electromagnetic waves by de craving of business for wireless telegraphs. [^6] impell Maxwell make e formulate correct theory for an ideological superstructure of de selfish class of the bourgeoisie. Doubt nor dey say bacterial research dey instigated nor be only by de desire to fight contagious disease but by de desire of de producer of wine and of cheese make dem improve dia methods of production. But de result wey dem obtain nor dey "ideological" for Marxian sense

De thing wey induce Marx make e  invent im ideology-doctrine na de wish to sap de prestige of economics. He dey fully aware of im impotence make e refute de objection wey dem economists raise to de practicability of de socialist schemes. In fact e dey so fascinated by de theoretical system of British classical economics wey he firmly believe for im impregnability. E either nor learn about de doubts say de classic theory of value wey dem raise for de mind of judicious scholars, abi, if ever hear about dem, e nor comprehend dia weight. Im own economic ideas dey hardly more than garbled version of Richardianism. When Jevons and Menger inaugurate new era of economic thought, im career as an author of economic writing don already come to an end; dem don already publish de first volume of Das Kapital several years previously. De only reaction wey Marx get to de marginal value theory na say e postpone de publication of de later volume of im main treatise. Dem make dem accessible to de public only after im death.

If dem wan develop de ideology-doctrine, Marx exclusively aim de economics and de social philosophy of utilitarianism. Im only intention na to destroy de reputation of economic teachings wey e dey unable to refute by means of logic and ratiocination. E give im doctrine de form of universal law wey dey valid for de whole historical age of social classes cos dem nor fit consider statement wey dey applicable to only one individual historical event as a law. For de same reasons e nor restrict im validity to only economic thought, but e include every branch of knowledge.

De service wey bourgeois economics render to de bourgeoisie na two fold for Marx eyes. E aid dem first for dia fight against feudalism and royal despotism and den later again for dia fight against de proletarian class wey dey rise.  E provide rational and moral justification for capitalist exploitation. If we want use notion wey dem develop after Marx death describe am, na rationalization of de claims of de capitalists. [^8] De capitalist, for dia subconsciousness ashamed of de meaning greed wey dey motivate dia own conduct and anxious to avoid social disapproval, dey encourage dia sycophants, de economists, make dem proclaim doctrines wey fit rehabilitate dem for public opinion.

Now, recourse to de tori of rationalization  dey provide  psychological description of de incentives wey dey impell a man or a group of men make dem formulate theorem abi a whole theory. But e nor predicate anything about de validity abi invalidity of de theory advanced. If e dey proved say de theory concerned dey untenable, de notion of rationalization na psychological interpretation of de causes wey make dia authors dey liable to error. But if we nor dey for de position to find any fault for de theory advanced, nor appeal to de concept of rationalization fit possibly explode im validity. If na true say de economist get for dia subconsciousness nor design wey pass de one wey dem go take use justify de unfair claims of de capitalists, dia theories go nevertheless dey quite correct.   Means nor dey to take expose faulty theory other than to refute am by discursive reasoning and to substitute better theory for am. If we wan deal with de theorem of Pythagoras or with de theory of comparative cost, we nor dey interested for de psychological factors wey impell Pythagoras and Ricardo to construct dese theorems, although, dese things fit dey important for de historian and de biographer. For science de only question wey dey relevant na whether or not dese theorems fit stand de test of rational examination. De social abi racial background of dia authors dey beside de point.

Na fact say people in de pursuit of dia selfish interest try to use doctrines wey dey more or less universally accepted by public opinion. Moreover, dem dey eager to invent and to propagate doctrines wey dem fit possibly use to further dia own interests. But dis  nor explain why dat kin doctrine, wey dey favour de interest of a minority and wey dey contrary to de interest of de rest of de people, dey endorsed by public opinion. E nor matter whether dat kin "ideological" doctrine na product of ""false consciousness," wey dey force man make e think unwittingly for manner wey serve de interest of im class, abi whether dem be de product of purposeful distortion of truth, dem must encounter de ideologies of other classed come try to supplant dem. Den a rivalry between antagonistic ideologies go emerge.  De Marxians explain victory and defeat for dat kin conflict as outcome of de interference of historical providence. Geist, de mystical prime mover, dey operate according to definite plan. E lead mankind through various preliminary stages to de final bliss of socialism. Every stage na de product of certain state of technology; all im other characteristics na de necessary superstructure of dis technological state. Geist cause man make e bring about in due time de technological ideas wey dey adequate to de stage wey im live, and to realise dem. All de rest na outgrowth of de state of technology. Na de hand-mill make feudal society; na de steam-mill make capitalism.  [^9] Human go only play ancillary role for dear changes. De inexorable law of historical development force men-- independently of dia own wills- make dem think and behave according to de patterns wey dey corresponding to de material basis of dia age. Men dey fool demsef if dem believe say dem dey free to choose between various ideas and between de thing wey dem dey call truth and error. Dey demsef nor dey think; na historical providence dey manifests imsef for dia thoughts.

Na fact say people in de pursuit of dia selfish interest try to use doctrines wey dey more or less universally accepted by public opinion. Moreover, they are eager to invent and to propagate doctrines which they could possibly use for furthering their own interests. But this does not explain why such doctrines, favoring the interests of a minority and contrary to the interests of the rest of the people, are endorsed by public opinion. No matter whether such "ideological" doctrines are the product of a "false consciousness," forcing a man to think unwittingly in a manner that serves the interests of his class, or whether they are the product of a purposeful distortion of truth, they must encounter the ideologies of other classes and try to supplant them. Then a rivalry between antagonistic ideologies emerges. The Marxians explain victory and defeat in such conflicts as an outcome of the interference of historical providence. Geist, the mythical prime mover, operates according to a definite plan. He leads mankind through various preliminary stages to the final bliss of socialism. Every stage is the product of a certain state of technology; all its other characteristics are the necessary ideological superstructure of this technological state. Geist causes man to bring about in due time the technological ideas adequate to the stage in which he lives, and to realize them. All the rest is an outgrowth of the state of technology. The hand-mill made feudal society; the steam-mill made capitalism.[^9] Human will and reason play only an ancillary role in these changes. The inexorable law of historical development forces men--independently of their wills--to think and to behave according to the patterns corresponding to the material basis of their age. Men fool themselves in believing that they are free to choose between various ideas and between what they call truth and error. They themselves do not think; it is historical providence that manifests itself in their thoughts.

Dis na purely mystical doctrine. De only proof wey dem give in im support na de recourse of Hegelian dialectics. Capitalistic private property na de first negation of individual private property. E begets, with de inexorability of law of nature, im own negation , namely common ownership of de means of production.[^10] Na undeniable fact say dere prevails an irreconcilable conflict of interest between dose workers wey dey employed at union wage rate and dose one wey remain unemployed cos de enforcement of union rates prevents de demand for and de supply of labor say make dem nor find de appropriate price for meeting.  It is nor less true say de interest of de workers of de comparatively overpopulated countries and de one of de comparatively underpopulated countries dey antogonistic with regard to migration barriers. De statement say de interest of all proletarians uniformly require de substitution of socialism for capitalism na de arbitrary postulate of Marx and de other socialists. Dem nor fit prove am by mere assertion say de socialist idea na de emanation of proletarian thought and derefore e dey certainly beneficial to de interests of de proletariat like dat.

One popular interpretation of how de British foreign trade dey liable to change, wey base on top de idea of Sismondi, Frederick List, Marx, and de German Historical school, dey like dis: For de second part of de eighteenth century and for big part of de nineteenth century de thing way British bourgeoisie class interest bin require na free trade policy. And so British political economy come set up free trade doctrine,  and de British manufacturers dem come organize one popular movement wey finally succeed to remove protective tariff dem. Den condition come change later. De British bourgeoisie bin nor fit stand again to compete with odas for foreign manufacturing and protective tariff wey people nid hot hot. Na cos of dis one wey economist dem come substitute one theory of protection for de free trade ideology wey dem already know, so Great Britain come return to protectionism.

De first mistake for dis interpretation na say e consider de "bourgeoisie" as one class of de same people wey get de same interest. One businessman go always dey see am as necessary to adjust de conduct of im business make e match de institutional condition of im country. Afta some time wen im go don reach to be entrepreneur and capitalist ,weda tariff dey or not e nor go affecf am. Im go start to dey produce dose commodity wey im go fit produce with profit unda some kind  state affairs. Wetin go affect im short-run interest for good or bad way na changes wey go happen for de institutional setting. But dose kind changes nor dey affect de various branches of business and various enterprises de same way and to de same extent. One way fit benefit one branch or enterprise but  spoil things for anoda branch or enterprise. Wetin business man dey hold hand na just few custom item dem. And as e regard dis item de interest of various branches and firms dem na to end am.

Na all kind of privilege from government wey go fit favour de interest of every branch. But if na de same privilege wey oda firms receive, every business man nor go only lose--as consumer wey dem be but also as buyer of raw materials, half-finished products, machines and oda equipment--for de one hand just as im profit for de oda hand. Selfish group interest go fit make man to ask for protection for im own branch or firm. Dem nor go motivate am to ask for universal protection for all branches or firm dem if im nor sure say im protection go tight pass oda industries or enterprise dia own.

Nor be say British manufacturers sef from how dia class see am been  get interest for de removal of de Corn Laws pass oda British citizen dem. De landowner dem nor agree as dem remove dis law dem cos if dem lower de price of agricultural products e go make rent for land to drop. One special class interest wey de manufacturers get go fit only make sense on top de mata of de tay tay iron law of wages wey dem been remove and de complete  untenable doctrine wey  say profit na outcome of de exploitation of de workers.

For inside world wey dey organised unda de  basis of division of labor, all change must to affect de short-run interest of many groups one way or anoda.It is therefore always easy to expose every doctrine supporting an alteration of existing conditions as an "ideological" disguise of the selfish interests of a special group of people. The main occupation of many present-day authors is such unmasking. Marx did not invent this procedure. It was known long before him. Its most curious manifestation was the attempts of some eighteenth-century writers to explain religious creeds as a fraudulent deception on the part of the priests eager to gain power and wealth both for themselves and for their allies, the exploiters. The Marxians endorsed this statement in labeling religion "opium for the masses."[^12] It never occurred to the supporters of such teachings that where there are selfish interests pro there must necessarily be selfish interests contra too. It is by no means a satisfactory explanation of any event that it favored a special class. The question to be answered is why the rest of the population whose interests it injured did not succeed in frustrating the endeavors of those favored by it.

For inside world wey dey organised unda de  basis of division of labor, all change must to affect de short-run interest of many groups one way or anoda. So e dey easy to expose all doctrine wey dey support  make dem change condition wey don dey exist as "Ideological" disguise of de selfish interest of one special group of people. De main work of many authors of nowadays dey show us some truth. Nor be Marx wey invent dis procedure. Dem don know am already before im come. De most curious way wey im show im sef na for de attempt wey some eighteen-century writers been make to explain religious tori as tori wey dey deceive for de part of de priest dem wey want gain power and wealth for dia sef and dia people, dose wey dey exploit oda people. De Marxians stamp dis tori to label religion "opium for de country people." [^12]  de supporters of dis teaching nor know say where selfish interest pro dey selfish interest contra go dey too. E nor get any how wey dis one take be beta explanation of any event say e favour one special class. De question wey dey ground na why de rest of de population wey dis thing injure dia interest nor succeed to wreck de endeavors of dose people wey e favour.

Every firm and every branch of business dey for de short run, dem get interest for increased sales of dia product. For de long run, howeva one tendency dey prevail toward make all returns dey equal inside de various branches of production. If demand for de product of one branch increase and e raise profit, more capital go flow enta and de  competition of de new enterprise dem go cut down de profit. E nor get how returns go high for de sale of articles wey go damage sociality pass to sell acticle wey go benefit sociality. If one particular branch of business break  law and dose wey put body inside get to face prosecution, penalties and imprisonment, gross profit must to high well to compensate for de risk wey dey inside.  But dis one nor dey interfere with de height of net returns.

Rich people, de people wey get de plants wey dey operate already, nor get particular class interest to maintain free competition. Dem nor dey like confiscation and expropriation of dia property, but de interest wey dem get inside dey favour de ways to prevent newcomers to challenge dia position. Dose wey dey fight for free enterprise and free competition nor dey defend de interest of dose rich people today. Dem want unknown men to get free hand, wey go be de entrepreneurs of  tomorrow and  wey dia skills go make de life of next generation dem to dey more agreeable. Dem want make de road dey open for more economic improvement. Dem be de spokesmen of material progress.

De nineteenth-century success of free trade ideas been happen cos of de theories of class economics. De respect wey dis idea dem get been huge so tay dose wey dis theory hurt dia selfish class interest nor fit hinder  dia endorsement by public opinion and wetin dem don know by legislative measures. Na idea wey dey make history, nor be history wey dey make ideas.

E nor get any use to argue with dose wey get spiritual eye. Dem dey give tori based on dia intuition and dem nor get time to check weda e make sense or not. De Marxians pretend say wetin dia inner voice dey talk na history dey reveal im sef. If oda people nor hear dis voice e mean say dem nor be chosen ones. Na insult say dose wey dey struggle for darkness go come dey argue with dose wey get inspiration. Decency suppose make dem to creep go one corner and keep quiet.

Howeva, science nor fit stop to dey think, although e dey obvious say e nor go eva succeed to convince dose wey argue say reason na supreme. Science must to emphasize say to use intuition nor go fit answer de question say na which of several antagonistic doctrine be de right one and which one dey wrong. Na fact we nor dey deniable say Marxism nor be de only advance doctrine or our time. Oda "ideology" dey apart from Marxism. De Marxians dey assert say to apply all dis oda doctrines go hurt de interest of many people. But de supporters of dis doctrine dem dey talk de same thing about Marxism.

Of cos, de Marxians consider one doctrine bad if de person wey write am nor dey of low social status. But who dey for low social status ? Doctor Marx, de manufacturer and de "exploiter" Engels, and Lenin, de rich Russian gentle men, nor get proletarian background. But Hitler and Mussolini na people from low social status, and dem spend dia youth age for poverty. De conflict wey dey between de Bolshevik and de Mensheviks or de one between Stalin and Trotsky nor go fit fall under class conflicts. Dose ones na conflict between various sect of fanatics dem wey dey call dia sef traitors.

De essence of Marxian philosophy na dis one: We dey right cos na we be de spokesmen of de rising proletarian class. Discursive reasoning nor go fit spoil our teachings, cos na de supreme power wey inspire am, na im wey dey determine de destiny of man pikin. Our enemy dem dey wrong cos dem nor get de intuition wey dey guide our mind. Nor be dia fault true true, say as e concern dia class dem nor dey equipped with proletarian logic and ideology don blind dem. De decrees of history wey nor dey fathomable, wey don elect us don cos wahala for dem. Na we get de future.
