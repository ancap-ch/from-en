### Racial Polylogism

Marxian polylogism na solution wey try solve or dey try comot de doctrines of socialism wey dey untenable. As im try to substitute intuition in place of ratiocination e follow relate wit wetin man dem dey think for dia mind.  But na dis kind attitude dey put Marxian polylogism and im offshoot, wetin dem dey call "sociology of knowledge," in antagonism wey nor fit reconcile wit science and reason.

E dey different from de polylogism of de racists. Dis kind polylogism dey in agreement with fashionable, even though na  mistake, things wey dey present dis days. Na true talk day man dey divided into different kind races. de races get difference in  de features of body. Materialist philosophers dey talk say thoughts na wetin de brain dey secrete just like na gall bladder dey secrete bile. E no go  make sense if dem no accept de result wey be say de  secretion wey  dey bring thought for different in quality for different races, before time. De fact say Anatomy never succeed up till now to find de differences wey dey for brain  cells no fit mean say  de doctrine wey  come from de mind wey talk say logical structure of de mind dey different with different races, dey wrong.  E no exclude de assumption wey be say research fit find out say dose kind things fit dey.

Some ethnologists dey tell us say na mistake to dey speak of civilizations wey dey higher and lower and to dey speak of  alien races wey dey backward. de civilizations of various races dey different from de Western civilization of de Caucasian stock people, but dem nor dey inferior. Every race get im own  peculiar mentality. e dey faulty to dey apply  yardsticks wey dey abstracted from wetin oda races don achieve to dia civilization. Westerners dey talk say de civilization of China na arrested civilization and dem say de one of people wey dey live for inside New Guinea na primitive barbarism. But de Chinese and de natives of New Guinea no send our civilization just like we no send dia own. Dose kind estimates na judgement and so dem dey arbitrary. Dose oda races get different structure of mind. Dia civilizations dey adequate to dia mind as we own civilization dey adequate to our mind. We dey no fit gree say wetin we dey call backwardness no mean anytin to dem. Na, if we dey look dia logic,  beta way to come get satisfactory arrangement with dia natural conditions of life and e beta pass our own progress. 

All dis ethnologists dey right to talk say no be wetin historian work--and de ethnologist sef na historian--to go dey express value judgments. But dem dey very wrong to gree say na motive guide wetin dis oda races dey do apart from de ones wey don follow wetin de white race dey do. de Asiatics and de Africans wey no dey like de European people dey eager to dey struggle successfully so dem go fit survive and do dem go use dat one as wetin go fight for dem for wetin dem dey do. dem don try to stop beasts of prey and disease, dem  don try to stop lack of food and dem don try to increase wetin dey comot from labour. We nor fit talk say as dem dey try do all dis things dem don succeed pass white people. de proof be say dem dey eager to gain from wetin de West don get. Dose ethnologists go dey correct, if Mongols or Africans wey sickness dey worry no gree make doctor wey from Europe help dem becos say dia brain or wetin dey dey believe na say e dey beta to suffer dan to dey free from pain. Mahatma Gandhi bin forget about everything wey im sabi wen im bin enta modern hospital make dem treat am for appendicitis. 

De North American Indians bin  lack de  ingenuity to invent de wheel. De people wey dey for inside Alps bin no really wan construct skis wey for make us agree with dia hard life. Dose kind shortcomings no be becos say dia mentality different from de  races wey bin don use wheels and skis; dem bin be failures, even wen we bin judge from how de Indians and de Alpine mountaineers bin see am.

But, all dis things wey dem  dey consider just  dey try explain de motives wey dey determine some kind actions, nor be just  to de problem wey be say whether difference in de logical structure of mind dey for different races dey or nor dey. na wetin dey  bring racism be dis.[^13]

We fit talk say wetin dem don talk for de chapters before dis one about de fundamental issues of de logical structure of mind  and de categorical principles of thought and action. Some kind additional observations go make sense to give to de finishing stroke to racial polylogism and to any oda kind brand of polylogism.

De categories of human thought and action nor be arbitrary products of de human mind or conventions. Dem nor dey  outside de universe and dem nor dey outside de course of cosmic events. Dem be biological facts and dem get one particular function for dis life and reality. Dem be instruments for man  struggle for existence and for im endeavors to try adjust himself to de real way wey de universe  be and to remove uneasiness as much as im fit. E mean say dem dey very important to de structure of de outside world and dem dey reflect de properties of de world and of reality. Dem dey work, and for dis mata dem dey true and valid.

e dey wrong to say insight and pure reasoning nor dey carry information about reality and de structure of de universe. De fundamental logical relations and de categories of thought and action na im be de main source of all wey man sabi. dem dey important to de structure of reality, dem dey reveal dis structure to de human mind and, in dis sense, dem dey good for man basic ontological facts.[^14] We no sabi wetin superhuman intellect fit think and comprehend. For man every cognition dey conditioned by de logical structure of how im mind dey and  e dey implied for dis structure. na de  satisfactory results wey de empirical sciences get and dia  practical application wey make dis mata true. inside de orbit wey h human action dey able to reach ends wey im dey aim at, room no dey for agnosticism.

If say races bin dey wey bin don develop different logical structure of de mind,  dem for don fail for dey use of reason as wetin go help dem for dey struggle to dey exist. De only means for survival wey for protect dem so dem go still dey for be dia instinct. Natural selection for follow comot dose specimens of dose kind races wey bin try use reasoning as direction of dia behavior. Dose individuals alone na dem for survive wey bin rely on  instincts only. Dis one mean say na only dose wey no rise above de mental level of animals na im for survive.

The scholars of the West have amassed an enormous amount of material concerning the high civilizations of China and India and the primitive civilizations of the Asiatic, American, Australian, and African aborigines. It is safe to say that all that is worth knowing about the ideas of these races is known. But never has any supporter of polylogism tried to use these data for a description of the allegedly different logic of these peoples and civilizations.
