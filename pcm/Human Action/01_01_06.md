### De Alter Ego

If we dey prepared to take de term causality for e broadest sense, teleology fit be called one variety of causal inquiry. Final causes na first of all causes. De cause of one event dey seen as one action por quasi-action wey dey aim at some end.

Both primitive man and de infant, for one naïve anthropomorphic attitude, consider am quite plausible say every change and event na de outcome of de action of one being wey dey act in de same way as dem dey do themselves. Dem believe say animals, plants, mountains, rivers, and fountains, even stones and celestial bodies, na, like themselves, dey feel, dey will, and dey act as beings. Only for one later stage of cultural development nai man go renounce dis animistic ideas and substitute de mechanistic world view for dem. Mechanicalism prove to be so satisfactory one principle of conduct wey people finally believe am to dey capable to dey solve all de problems of thought and scientific research. Materialism and panphysicalism proclaim mechanicalism as de essence of all knowledge and de experimental and mathematical method of de natural sciences as de sole scientific mode to dey think.

All changes dey to be comprehended as motions subject to de laws of mechanics.

De champions of mechanicalism nor dey bother about de problems wey dem never solve of de logical and epistemological basis of de principles of causality and imperfect induction. For their eyes dis principles na sound because dem dey work. De fact say experiment for de laboratory bring about de result wey de theory predict and say machines for de factory run for one way wey de technology predict prove, dem say, de soundness of de method and findings of modern natural science. Granted say science nor fit give us truth—and who knows wetin de truth really means?—for any rate e dey certain say e work to dey lead us to success.

But e dey precisely when we accept dis pragmatic point of view say de emptiness of de panphysicalist dogma become manifest. Science, as e don point come out before, never succeed to dey solve de problem of de mind-body relations. De panphysicalists certainly nor go fit contend say de procedures dem recommend don ever work for de field of interhuman relations and of de social sciences. But e dey beyond doubt say de principle according to which one _Ego_ deals with every human being as if de other na one thinking and acting being like imself don evidence e usefulness both for mundane life and for scientific research. E nor go fit dey denied say e work.

E dey beyond doubt say  de practice to dey consider fellow men as beings who think and act like me, de Ego, do don turn out well; on de other hand, de prospects look hopeless to dey get one similar pragmatic verification for de postulate wey require dem to dey treated in de same manner as de object of de natural sciences. The epistemological problems wey de comprehension of other people behaviour raise dey no less intricate than those of causality and incomplete induction. e fit dey admitted say e dey impossible to provide conclusive evidence for de propositions say my logic na de logic of all other people and by all means  na absolutely de only logic and say de categories of all human actions na de categories of all other people action and by all means na absolutely de categories of all human action. Anyhow as  e be, de pragmatist must remember say dis propositions work both in practice and in science, and de positivist must not overlook de fact say to dey address e fellow men he presupposes –tacitly and implicitly—de intersubjective validity of logic and thereby de reality of de realm of de alter Ego’s thought and action, of e own eminent human character [^8]. 

Thinking and acting na de specific human features of man. Dem dey peculiar to all human beings. Dem na, beyond membership for de zoological species homo sapiens, de characteristic mark of man as man. Nor be de scope of praxeology to investigate de relation of thinking and acting. For praxeology, e dey enough to establish say na only one logic wey dey intelligible to de human mind, and dat na only one mode of action wey be human and comprehensible to de human mind. Whether dem dey or fit dey for somewhere other beings—superhuman or subhuman—who think and act for one different way, dey beyond de reach of de human mind. We must restrict our endeavors to de study of human action.

Dis human action wey dey inextricably linked with human thought dey conditioned by logical necessity. E dey impossible for de human mind to conceive logical relations at variance with de logical structure of our mind. E dey impossible for de human mind to conceive one mode of action wey de categories go different from de categories wey determine our own actions.

For man na only two principles dey available for one mental grasp of reality, namely, those of theological and causality. Wetin nor go fit come under either of dis categories dey absolutely hidden to de human mind. One event wey nor open to one interpretation by one of dis two principles for man dey  inconceivable and mysterious. Change go fit dey conceive as de outcome of either of de operation of mechanistic causality or of purposeful  behaviour; for de human mind, e nor get third way wey dey available[^9]. Na true, as already mentioned, say teleology go fit dey viewed as one variety of causality. But de establishment of dis fact nor dey annul de essential differences between de two categories.

De panmechanistic world view dey committed to one methodological monism; e acknowledge only mechanistic causality because e attribute to am alone any cognitive value or at least one higher cognitive value than teleology. Dis na one metaphysical superstition. Both principles of cognition—causality and teleology –na, owing to de limitations of human reason, dey imperfect and nor dey convey ultimate knowledge. Causality leads to one _regressus in infinitum_ wey reason nor go fit exhaust. Teleology dey found wanting as soon as de question dey raised of wetin move de prime mover. Either method stop for one ultimate wey dem give wey nor go fit dey analyzed and interpreted. Reasoning and scientific inquiry nor go ever fit bring full ease of mind, apodictic certainty, and perfect cognition of all things. He wey seek dis must apply to faith and try to quiet e conscience by to dey embrace one creed or one metaphysical doctrine. 

If we nor transcend de realm of reason and experience, we nor go fit help to dey acknowledge say our fellow men dey act. We nor dey free to disregard dis fact for de sake of one fashionable prepossession and one arbitrary opinion. Daily experience prove not only say de sole suitable method to dey study de conditions of our nonhuman environment dey provided by de category of causality; e prove no less to dey convince say our fellow men na acting beings as we ourselves be. For de comprehension of action one scheme of interpretation and analysis dey available, namely, same provided by de cognition and analysis of our own purposeful behaviour. 

De problem of de study and analysis of other people action dey in no way connected with de problem of de existence of one _soul_ or of one _immortal soul_. As far as de objection of empiricism, behaviorism, positivism dey directed against any variety of de soul-theory, dem be of no avail be our problem. De question we go deal with na whether e dey possible to grasp human action intellectually if one refuse to comprehend am as meaningful and purposeful behavior to dey aim for de attainment of definite ends.  Behaviorism and positivism wan apply de method of de empirical natural sciences to de reality of human action. Dem interpret am as one response to stimuli. But dis stimuli themselves nor dey open to description by de method of natural sciences. Every attempt to  describe dem must refer to de meaning which men wey dey act attach to dem. We fit call de offering of one commodity for sale one “stimulus.” But wetin dey essential for such offer and distinguish am from other offer nor go fit dey described without dem nor enter  into de meaning wey de acting parties attribute to de situation. No dialectical artifice go fit spirit away de fact say man dey driven by de aim to attain certain ends. Na dis purposeful behavior—viz., action—wey be de subject matter of our science. We nor go fit approach our subject if we disregard de meaning which man wey dey act attach to de situation, that is, de given state of affairs, and to e own behavior with regards to dis situation.

E nor dey appropriate for de physicist to search for final causes because dere is no indication say de event wey be de subject matter of physics dey to be interpreted as de outcome of actions of one being, dey aim at end for one human way. Or say e dey appropriate for de praxeologist to disregard de operation of de acting being’s volition and intention; dem na undoubtedly given facts. If he were to disregard am, he go cease to study human action. Very often—but not always—de events wey e concern go fit dey investigated both from de point of view of praxeology and from dat of natural sciences. But im wey deal with de discharging of one firearm from de physical and chemical point of view nor be praxeologist. He neglect de very problems wey de science of purposeful human behaviors aim to clarify.

#### On de Serviceableness of Instincts

De proof of de fact say only two avenues of approach dey available for human research, causality or teleology, dey provided by de problem raised in reference to de serviceableness of instincts.  Types of behavior dey wey for one hand, nor go fit be consider as purposeful human action. In order to grasp such behavior we dey forced to resort to one makeshift. We assign to am de character of one quasi-action; we speak of serviceable instincts.

We observe two things: first de inherent tendency of one living organism to respond to one stimulus according to one regular pattern, and second de favorable effects of dis kind of behavior for de strengthening or preservation of de organism vital forces. If we dey for one position to interprete such behavior as de outcome of purposeful aiming for certain ends, we go call am action and deal with am according to de teleological method of praxeology. But as we find no trace of one conscious mind behind dis behavior, we suppose say one unknown factor –we call am _instinct_--dey instrumental. We talk say de instinct directs quasi-purposeful animal behavior and unconscious but nonetheless serviceable response of human muscles and nerves. Yet, de mere fact say we hypostatize de unexplained element of dis behavior as one force and call am instinct nor enlarge our knowledge. We must never forget say dis word instinct na nothing but one landmark to indicate one point beyond which we dey unable, up to de present at least, to carry our scientific scrutiny.

Biology don succeed  to dey discover one “natural,” that is, mechanistic, explanation for many processes which for earlier days dey attributed to de operation of instincts. Nonetheless many others don remain wey nor fit be interpreted as mechanical or chemical responses to mechanical or chemical stimuli. Animal display attitudes wey nor go fit dey comprehended otherwise than through de assumption say one directing factor dey operative.

De aim of behaviorism to study human action from without with de methods of animal psychology na illusory. As far as animal behavior go beyond mere physiological processes like breathing and metabolism, e go fit only be investigated with de aid of de meaning-concept wey praxeology develop. De behaviorist approach de object of im own investigation with de human notion of purpose and success. He dey unwittingly apply to de subject matter of im own studies de human concept of serviceableness and perniciousness. He deceive imself to dey exclude all verbal reference to de consciousness and aiming at ends. In fact im mind search for everywhere for ends and measure every attitude  with de yardstick of one garbled notion of serviceableness. De science of human behavior—as far as e nor be physiology—nor fit abandon reference to meaning and purpose. E nor fit learn anything from animal psychology and de observation of de unconscious reactions of newborn pikin. Na, on de contrary, animal psychology and infant psychology wey nor fit renounce de aid afforded by de science of human action. Without praxeological categories we go be at a loss to conceive and to understand de behavior both of animals and of infants.

De observation of de instinctive behavior of animals fill man with astonishment and raise questions which nobody go fit answer satisfactorily. Yet de fat say animals and even plants react for one quasi-purposeful way na neither more nor less miraculous than dat man think and act, say for de inorganic universe those functional correspondences prevail wey physics describe, and say for de inorganic universe biological processes occur. All dis na miraculous for de sense say na ultimate given for our searching mind.

Such ultimate given na also wetin we call animal instinct. Like de concepts of motion, force, life, and consciousness, de concept of instinct too na merely one term to signify one ultimate given. To be sure, e neither “explains” anything nor indicate one cause or one ultimate cause.[^10]

#### De Absolute End

In order to avoid any possible misinterpretation of de praxeological categories e dey expedient to emphasize one truism.

Praxeology, like de historical sciences of human action, deal with purposeful _human_ action. If e mention _ends_, wetin e get in view na de ends at which men wey dey act aim. If e speak of _meaning_, e refer to de meaning wey  men wey dey act attach to their actions.

Praxeology and history na manifestations of de human mind and as such dey conditioned by de intellectual abilities of mortal men. Praxeology and history nor dey pretend to know anything about de intentions of one absolute and objective mind, about one objective meaning inherent for de course of events and of historical evolution, and about de plans wey God or Nature or Weltgeist or Manifest Destiny dey try to realize to dey direct de universe and human affairs. Dem get nothing in common with wetin dem dey call philosophy of history. Dem nor dey, like de works of Hegel, Comte, Marx and a host of other writers, claim to reveal information about de true, objective, and absolute meaning of life and history.[^11]

#### Vegetative Man

Some philosophies advise men to seek as de ultimate end of conduct de complete renunciation of any action. Dem look upon life as one absolute evil full of pain, suffering, and anguish and apodictically deny say any purposeful human effort go fit render am tolerable. Happiness go fit be attained only by complete extinction of consciousness, volition, and life. De only way toward bliss and salvation na to become perfectly passive, indifferent, and inert like de plants. De sovereign good na de abandonment of thinking and acting.

Such na de essence of de teachings of various Indian philosophies, especially of Buddhism, and of Schopenhauer. Praxeology nor dey comment upon dem. E dey neutral with regards to all judgments of value and de choice of ultimate ends. E task nor be to approve or to disapprove, but to describe wetin e be.

De subject matter of praxeology na human action. E deal with man wey dey act, not with man wey transform into one plant and reduce to one yeye vegetative existence.
