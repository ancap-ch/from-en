### Praxeological Prediction

Praxeologocal knowledge makes na dey possible to dey predict with apodictic certainty de outcome of different mode of action. But, of course, de prediction nor go fit ever imply anytin way come dey regarding quantitative matters. Quantitative problems na de field of human being action way come open to nor other elucidation than dat by understanding.

We go fit predict, as will be shown later, dat--other things way be equal--a fall in de demand for ::a:: go come result in a drop inside de price of ::a::. But we nor go fit predict de extent of dis drop. Dis question go be answer only by understanding.

De fundamental deficiency come implied in every quantitative approach to economic problems consists in de neglect of de fact dat dere are nor constant relations between warin dey dem called economic dimensions. Dere na neither constancy nor continuity in de valuation and in de formation of exchange ration way dey between different commodities. Every new datum go come brings about a reshuffling of de whole price structure. Understanding, by trying to come grasp warin dey going on inside de minds of de men way dey concerned, can approach de problem of telling de future conditions. We go fit call its methods warin nor dey satisfactory and de positive may arrogantly scorn it. But dat arbitrary judgments must not and nor go fit abscure de fact dat understanding na de only appropriate method way dem go take come deal with de uncertainty of future conditions.
