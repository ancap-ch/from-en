We sabi wetin happen to the term liberal and liberalism. E don dey attached to so many different people and different positons sotey e don lose all e meaning and don become empty label wey no go description. Na d same fate nai don dey threaten the term libertarian and libertarianism wey dem make to regain some of correct meaning wey don loss sake of say the former label pai.

Sha, the tori of modern libertarianism never mature. E begin for Murray Rothbard’s parlour and e discover e coded expression for e *For A New Liberty. A Libertarian manifesto*,wey com publish for 1973. So, Ah geh hope and no wan give up on libertarianism wey Rothbard don define and explain with the kain correctness wey person no go fit argue, despite the many many times wey so-called libertarians don try to rub potto potto and rip off the good name wey libertarianism get for something totally different.

The tori, wey nobody fit argue wey form the core of the libertarian doctrine dey simple and no get long talk and I don explain am tire for this place. If things no scarce for this world, kasala or more precise physical gbenge no go happen. Gbenge between people na always because say things no many reach. I wan do A with one thing and you wan do B with the same thing. Na because of this kain matter- plus say we get ability to relate and argue with ourselves – we dey find correct behavior wey go help us avoid gbenge. If we no wan avoid gbenge, e no go make sense to de find these correct behavior. We go just dey de burst kasala anyhow. 

For case wey e be say, we no get agreement for wetin we want, kasala wey concern say things no many we no go fit dey escape unless say the resources wey dey, dem  go give am as private, no-go area kind of property to some kain individual or group of individual dem. Na only for this kain case nai I go fit stand tanda with *my* own things, from you, with *your* own things, without say me and you get kasala. 

But who go get the small things wey dey as private property and who no go get? First: Each person get e own physical body wey only am and no one else dey control *directly*. And second, as for things wey no many wey we go fit control *only* indirectly[^1]: Exclusive control[^2] go fit become and fit dey assigned to the person, who use the property wey we dey reason *first* or who get am through voluntary[^3] exchange from e *previous* owner. Na only the first user of a resource[^4] nai go fit get and gain control over am wey say gbenge nor go dey, i.e., in peace. Else, if exclusive control con reach hand of *latecomers*, gbenge no go dey avoided but opposite of the main reason for the norms ,we no go fit avoid am and e go dey like that forever. 

Before all of una wey dey ontop this tori, ah no need to begin enter long talk except make ah add say: if you wan live in peace with oda people dem and avoid all the gbenge and, if say gbenge burst, try settle am in peace, then you go must be anarchist or to dey more accurate a private property anarchist, an anarcho-capitalist or person wey support private law society.

And e go con mean, then and again without too much talk: Person, anybody, *no* be libertarian or no mere *fake* libertarian who dey agree with and dey promote one or more of these things: say e go must get a State, any State, of  ‘public’ (State) property and of taxes so e go dey possible to live in peace: or say e go dey and we go fit judge am as true of any so-called “human rights” or “civil rights” wey no concern provate property rights, like “women right,” “gay rights,” “minority rights”,  the “right” wey person no fit look you down, the “right” wey you fit commot where you dey without limit, the “right” to sure minimum income or to get free health care, lor the “right” to get freedom from talk wey you no like and thought. People wey dey support all these fit call themselves wetin they like, and as libertarians we go fit cooperate with them, so long as such cooperation go ensure say e draw us close to the real goal, but them no be *libertarians* or only *fake* libertarians.

Ehen, “one funny thing happen as we dey come this forum”. While me and Rothbard, as we dey follow e example, we no deviate from the idea wey don form firm beliefs, no be just non-libertarians in particular also fake libertarians, i.e., people wey dem claim (falsely) say dem *be* libertarians, and even dose wey dey honest but wey no get the correct sense wey don select as wetin them like pass *bêtes noires* and descendants of evil. Rothbard, the *spiritus rector* of new libertarianism, don get name wey this so-called “anti-fascist” group am as person wey no like change, rascist, sexist, an authoritarian, person wey favor say na only elites go rule, person wey no like anything foreign, a fascist, and to top am, person wey dey hate himself sake of say him be Jewish Nazi. And I con inherit all of these honorary titles, plus even some wey dem add (except the one wey concern Jewish one thing). So wetin funny come happen here? 

To try develop answer to this question don carry me jam the topic of this talk: the relationship wey dey between libertarianism and the alternative right or “Alt-Right,” which don gather national and international bad name after Hillary Clinton, during the last presidential election campaign, single am as one of the inspiration behind wetin she call “basket of deplorable” support for Trump[^5].

The Alt-Right movement na actually pickin of the paleo-conservative movement wey people begin know for early 1990’s, wey get columnist and best-selling author Patrick Buchanian as e best-known rep. E con go down wey nothing happen during late 1990’s, and na now e don recently, sake of the constanr damage wey don dey happen to America and e rep by the rule of them Bush I, Clinton I, Bush II and Obama tenor,don come out strongly more than before under the new name of Alt-Right. Many of the people wey dey shine the light as dem associate with the Alt-Right don come here for the first meetings wey we hold as the years dey waka. Paul Gottfried, who first form the name, Peter Brimelow, Richard Lynn, Jared Taylor, John Derbyshire, Steve Sailer and Richard Spencer. Even self, dem don callSean Gabb and my name as e connect with Alt-Right, and my work self don dey linked close with the one wey relate with neo-reationary movement wey dey gingered by Curtis Yarvin[^6] and e blog wey no dey exist again wey e call *Unqualified Reservations*. To put am together, all these relation and associations don earn me many mention by America’s most repped smear-and-defamation league the SPLC[^7].

As e be so: Wetin con happen to the relationship wey dey between libertarianism and the Alt-Right and the reason why I invite chairmen of representatives of Alt-Right dem come meeting with libertarians? Libertarians dey united by the strong belief wey ah don mention before. They dey clear about wetin dem wan achieve. But libertarian doctrine no really mean much if we reason these questions: 

1. How we wan maintain libertarian order once we don achieve am;
2. How we wan attain a libertarian order from starting point wey no be libertarian, whey go require:
   1. Say the person go must describe this starting point;
   2. Correctly identify the obstacles wey don sey to block the way of padi libertarian end by this same  starting point.

To answer all dese questions so, together with wetin dem don talk, you go also need to know about human psychology and sociology or at least small common sense about wetin dem mean. Yet, many libertarians dem and fake libertarians don ignore human psychology and sociology or no evin geh common sense about dem. They just dey blindly accept, even when clear evidence dey, say everybody dey equally rich, gehb similar human nature, say everybody and all society and culture dey equal and you fit exchange them. 

While e dey possible to characterize enough of contemporary libertarianism, then, as theory and theorists without say we talk of psychology and sociology, many or even most of the Alt-Right go be dey explained, in opposite, as psychology and sociology without theory. Alt-Righters no get common theory wey dey guide dem, and nothing dey wey even resemble shikinle like canonical text wey dey define am. Instead, the Alt-Right dey united basically in d way dem describe the modern world, and in particular the US and the so-called Western World, and the way dem dey know and locate the problems wey dey for e social structure. In short, e don dey rightly noted say the Alt-Right dey far more united by wetin e dey fight that wetin e dey encourage. E dey against , and in fact, e hate with passion, the elites them wey dey control the State, the MSM and academia. Why? Because all of dem dey encourage say may standard no dey and make different wrongs dey. And so, dem they promote,while the Alt-Right dey fight badly, egalitarianism, affirmative action[^8],multiculturalism and “free” mass movement from places as a way to take bring about multiculturalism. Also, the Alt-Right come hate everything  wey dey injure cultural Marxism or Gramsciism and all so called “political correctness” and with sense, e dey commot , without excuse, every accusations say e dey racist,sexist,elitist, supremacist, homophobe, xenophobe, etc., etc. And the Alt-Right also dey laugh as wetin no go survive the learner of programmatic motto of so-called libertarians such as the _ for Liberty_[^9] of “Peace, Love, and Liberty,” wey dem correctly  translate into German by Lichtschlag as “Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen.” In very clear opposite to this one,Alt-Righters dem put leg for ground say life also dey about strife, hate, struggle and fight, not just between people dem but also dey among different group of people wey dey act together. “_Millennial Woes”_[^10] done sharparly summarize the Alt-Right as:

>Equality na nonsense. Herierachy dey important. Races dey different. The sexes dey different. Morality gats value and degeneracy dey real. All culture no dey equal and we no dey under pressure to think say dem dey like that. Man na fallen creature and this life no just be about hollow materialism. Last last, the white race geh rep, and civilization dey precious. Na dis be d Alt-right.

Wey no unifying theory con dey, the argument go dey less among the Alt+Right  concerning the goal wey they wan achieve last last. Many of the leaders dem geh some kind liking for libertarians, most especially dose wey don come here[^11], even if dem no b am 100% and no go wan see themselves like that. All Alt-Righters wey don show here, for example, dey familiar with Rothbard and e work, all dis time d most new presidential candidate for Libertarian party never even hear of Rothbard name, and all fo them , as far as I know, dem blow  Ron Paul whistle during e primary campaign for the Republican Party to nominate am as presidential candidate, all dis time many people wey call themselves libertarians dey attack and try to match Ron Paul for neck sake of say e get – you know wetin ah wan talk already- na “racisist” views.

Make e for no lost, many of the Alt-Right leaders and plenty of e committed followers don encourage views wey no gel with libertarianism. Like Buchanan before and Trump now, dem get stubborn-head concerning make dem support policy wey dey restrictive, wey dey select well well and dey discriminate immigration[^12] with iron-hand policy wey restrict trade,economic protectionism and protective tariffs[^13].[^14]

Others don waka comot far, person like Richard Spencer, wey first make the term Alt-Right popular. For now sha, sake of recent publicity stunts, wey don dey gather bad blood for US, Spencer don claim rank of maximum leader of wetin e assume as mighty unified movement[^15]. When Spencer come here, some years ago,e still be like who dey strong as libertarian. Unfortunately, e don change and Spencer don wash hand comot, without any qualification at all, all libertarians and everthing wey concern libertarian and e don even go as far as to stand for socialism, as long as na socialism of and only for white people. See heavy disappointment!

As e be say no theoretical foundation dey, this division of Alt-Right into enemy sets no go dey too surprising. Yet that one no mean say make person overlook am, because the Alt-Right don bring many ideas wey geh value to take try answer the two question wey we don mention before wey libertarian theory no answer: of how we wan maintain libertarian social order and how e go dey possible to achieve dat kind order from the present, as e b un-libertarian status quo. The Alt-Right no discover these ideas. They don dey ground ever since and true true, large part no pass common sense. But recently those kind ideas don dey buried under mountains of egalitarian, leftist propaganda and credit must go to Alt-Right sake of say na dem bring am come light back.

To show say dat kind thinking geh value, make ah answer the first unanswered question first.

Many libertarians geh d view say all wetin we need to maintain a libertarian social order na to use iron face enforce he non-aggression principle (NAP). If e no happen, as long as people dey stay clear of aggression, according to this their view, the principle of “live and let live” go work. Still, while e look say this “live and let live” dey sound as if e make sense for pickin dem wey dey disobey parent’s power and all social accepted behavior and control[^16], and while e dey correct say d principle dey work for [people wey no dey stay together or wey no dey relate directly and from far, e *no* work or apply , or rather e dey *insufficient*, when e come to people wey dey stay close to each other, as neighbours and people wey dey stay the same community.


One simple example dey enough to make a point. Just imagine say you geh one new next-door neighbour. The neighbour no dey mess you or your property up in any way, but na bad neighbour. He dey dirty e own neighbouring property, turn am to refuse dump; for outside wey you fit see, e dey do some kind ritual wey make am dey kill animals, e don turn e house to “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with customers wey dey come steady day and night; e no dey ever offer to help and no dey ever keep e promise or even to speak for langua wey you get. Etc., etc.. Your life don turn nightmare. Yet you no fit mess am up as e never really jonx come your side. Wetin you fit do? You fit shun am or put am for one corner. But your neighbour no care, and in any case you on your own 'punishing' am no go make any difference to am. You gats get the communal respect and authority, or meet person who get am, to cajole everybody or at least many of the people for the area make dem make the neighbour a social outcast, so that pressure go dey on am to sell e property and move ahead. 

Wetin be the lesson? For neighbours and people wey geh direct regular contact with each other for one cabal to dey one place live in peace – a quiet and friendly place wey dem fit run parole like paddy - need say dem go get common culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. E go dey possible for different cultures to run dey together on distant level, cribs wey no near, but multi-culturalism, cultures wey dey different, no go fit dey for the same place and zone wey no go see reduced trust, increased pressure, and finally the call for "strong man" and the fall down of anything wey be like libertarian social order. 

And before nkor: just as libertarian order gats dey on guard against "bad" (even if e no dey aggressive) neighbours through say dem put am for corner, i.e., by common "you no dey wanted here" culture, so, and even more watchful like that, so e go must dey guarded against neighbours who go openly dey advocate for communism, socialism, syndicalism or democracy in any shape or form. They, as e be say dem dey pose as threat to all private property and property owners, must no only dey for one corner, but they must, to use one well-known Hoppe-meme, "commot physically," if e warrant am by gbenge, and force dem to go look for better place. To no do am last last go lead to - well, communism, socialism, syndicalism or democracy and hence, the very opposite of libertarian social order.

With these rightist” or as ah go put am, plain common sense kind of ideas for mind ah dey turn now to the question wey dey more challenging of how we go commot from here, the status quo, to the other side. And for this e fit dey instructive to first sharparly consider the answer wey don come by liberallala, the peace-love-and-liberty, the Friede-Freude-Eierkuchen or the capitalism-is-love libertarians. E don expose the same fundamental egalitarianism, even if na slightly different form, as the kind wey dey show up for the the live-and-let-live libertarians. Na these ones as ah don try to explain, nai define wetin we fit call the "bad neighbour problem" - and wetin be mere short-hand for the overall problem wey dey show face by reason of coexistence of different alien wey dey clear, mutually disturbing, annoying, strange or behaviour wey dey jonx - simply sake of say e dey exist. And true true, if you assume, against all correct evidence with proof, say everybody, everywhere, dey essential the same, then, as per definition, nothing like "bad neighbour problem" dey exist. 

The same egalitarian,  or as the liberallala-libertarians themselves prefer to call am, "humanitarian" spirit also come show face for the answer to the question of a libertarian strategy. To put am together, their advice na say: dey nice and yearn everybody - and then, for future things, na the better libertarian argument go win. To show am, take my forme-friend-turned-foe Jeffrey Tucker’s five “Don’ts When Talking Liberty.” Dem be:

no dey aggressive ;
no dey presume say you hate liberty ;
no dey presume different goals ;
no dey presume ignorance ;
no dey regard anybody as enemy. "

Now, apart from the fact say Tucker no seem to dey follow e own advice for e aggressive condemnation of the entire Alt-Right as liberty-hating fascists, ah dey also find e exhortation truly astounding. Dem go look like good advice in relation to people wey go just come out from nowhere, wey no geh history wey person fit trace at all, but in regard to real people wey get history wey look me for face as hopelessly naïve, no dey real and damn unproductive as we dey pursue libertarian end. See me (and I wan assume everybody here) know and don meet people for my life who no know, who geh different, un-libertarian goals, and who no hate liberty wey libertarians dey think - and why for this world ah no go hate an dey aggressive towards my enemies? 

As a libertarian strategy, e go be say, Tucker advice must dey regarded simple, as bad joke. But surely na good advice if person dey try enter the State as one kind "libertarian" advisor, and this go fit explain the joy wey Tucker "humanitarian" libertarianism don dey embraced by the entire liberallala-libertarian people. 

Wey we no dey reason egalitarian phantasy lands, for the other side, for the real world, libertarians must above every other thing dey realistic and recognise from the beginning, as the Alt-Right dey do, say the inequality wey dey not just between individuals but different cultures na part of human existence wey we no fit comot. We must also know say plenty enemies of liberty dey as libertarianism don define and that na dem, no be us, dey in charge of many world affairs; that for many part of the modern world na dem dey control the entire population so tey the idea of liberty and of libertarian social order never even reach some people ear and many consider am as unthinkable[^18]; and say na majorly for West, for countries wey dey Western and Central Europe and the land wey the people dey, nai the idea of liberty geh strong root and na for there nai we go fit challenge these enemies openly. And to concentrate our strategic considerations only for West, then, nai we go fit identify, almost as the Alt-Right don do effectively, these actors and agencies as our main enemies. 

Dem be:

1.  The people wey be elites wey dey in control of the State apparatus and particularly the "Deep State" or the so-called "Cathedral" wey d military get, the secret services, the central banks and the supreme courts. To add, dem include :
~~~~1.	The leaders of the military-industrial complex, i.e., of small private firm wey dey owe their existence to the State as the only or dominant buyer of their products;
~~~~2.	The people wey dey lead commercial banks, wey owe their privilege of creating money and credit from air to the existence of central bank and e role as "lender of last resort". Na dem together, then, State, Big-Business and Big-banking nai form d very powerful even though them small "mutual admiration society" wey don come together to rob huge population of tax-payers and con dey live big for their head. 
2. ([A] group of enemies wey dey even bigger dey made up of) the intellectuals, educators and "educrats," wey come from the highest level of academics down to the level of primary school and kindergartens. Funded almost single-handedly, whether na direct or indirect, by the State, dem, for their majority wey dey like bully, don become the soft tools and executioners wey dey willing for the hand of the ruling elites dem and even don dey designed for total power and control. 
3.  Dem journalists for MSM, wey be the weak products of the system of "public education, " and the coward people wey dey collect and whistle make everybody hear government "information."

Equally important in the development of a libertarian strategy then is the immediately following next question: who are the *victims*? The standard libertarian answer to this is: the tax-*payers* as opposed to the tax-*consumers*. Yet while this is essentially correct, it is at best only part of the answer, and libertarians could learn something in this respect from the Alt-Right: because apart from the narrowly economic aspect there is also a wider cultural aspect that must be taken into account in identifying the victims.

In order to expand and increase its power, the ruling elites have been conducting for many decades what Pat Buchanan has identified as a systematic “culture war,” aimed at a trans-valuation of all values and the destruction of all natural, or if you will “organic” social bonds and institutions such as families, communities, ethnic groups and genealogically related nations, so as to create an increasingly atomized populace, whose only shared characteristic and unifying bond is its common existential dependency on the State. The first step in this direction, taken already half a century or even longer ago, was the introduction of “public welfare” and “social security.” Thereby, the underclass and the elderly were turned into State-dependents and the value and importance of family and community was correspondingly diminished and weakened. More recently, further-reaching steps in this direction have proliferated. A new “victimology” has been proclaimed and promoted. Women, and in particular single mothers, Blacks, Browns, Latinos, homosexuals, lesbians, bi- and transsexuals have been awarded “victim” status and accorded legal privileges through non-discrimination or affirmative action decrees. As well, most recently such privileges have been expanded also to foreign-national immigrants, whether legal or illegal, insofar as they fall into one of the just mentioned categories or are members of non-Christian religions such as Islam, for instance. The result? Not only has the earlier mentioned “bad neighbor problem” not been avoided or solved, but systematically promoted and intensified instead. Cultural homogeneity has been destroyed, and the freedom of association, and the voluntary physical segregation and separation of different people, communities, cultures and traditions has been replaced by an all-pervasive system of forced social integration. Moreover, each mentioned “victim” group has thus been pitted against every other, and all of them have been pitted against white, heterosexual, Christian males and in particular those married and with children as the only remaining, legally un-protected group of alleged “victimizers.” Hence, as the result of the trans-valuation of all values promoted by the ruling elites, the world has been turned upside down. The institution of a family household with father, mother and their children that has formed the basis of Western civilization, as the freest, most industrious, ingenious and all-around accomplished civilization known to mankind, i.e., the very institution and people that has done most good in human history, has been officially stigmatized and vilified as the source of all social ills and made the most heavily disadvantaged, even persecuted group by the enemy elites’ relentless policy of *divide et impera*.

Accordingly, given the present constellation of affairs, then, any promising libertarian strategy must, very much as the Alt-Right has recognized:

1. Be tailored and addressed to this group of the most severely victimized people. White married Christian couples with children, in particular if they belong also to the class of tax-*payers* (rather than tax-consumers), and everyone most closely resembling or aspiring to this standard form of social order and organization can be realistically expected to be the most receptive audience of the libertarian message[^19]. Given this constellation of perpetrator-enemies vs. victims in the contemporary West, then, I can now come to the final task of trying to outline a realistic libertarian strategy for change. The specifics of which will have to be prefaced by two general considerations. For one, given that the class of intellectuals from the tops of *academia* to the opinion-molding journalists in the MSM are funded by and firmly tied into the ruling system, i.e., that they are a part of the *problem*, they also should not be expected to play a major if any role in the problem’s *solution*. Accordingly, the so-called Hayekian strategy for social change, that envisions the spread of correct libertarian ideas starting at the top, with the leading philosophers, and then trickling down from there to journalists and finally to the great unwashed masses, must be considered fundamentally unrealistic. Instead, any realistic libertarian strategy for change must be a *populist* strategy. That is, libertarians must short-circuit the dominant intellectual elites and address the masses directly to arouse their indignation and contempt for the ruling elites.
2. All the while the main addressees of a populist libertarian message must be indeed the just mentioned groups of dispossessed and disenfranchised native whites, I believe it to be a serious strategic error to make “whiteness” the exclusive criterion on which to base one’s strategic decisions, as some strands of the Alt-Right have suggested to do. After all, it is above all white men that make up the ruling elite and that have foisted the current mess upon us. True enough, the various protected “minorities” mentioned before take full advantage of the legal privileges they have been accorded and they have become increasingly emboldened to ask for ever more “protection,” but none of them and all of them together did not and do not possess the intellectual prowess that would have made this outcome possible, if it were not for the instrumental help that they received and are receiving from white men.

Now, taking our cues from the Buchanan-, the Paul- and the Trump-movement, on to the specifics of a populist strategy for libertarian change, in no specific order except for the very first one, which has currently assumed the greatest urgency in the public mind.

#### Stop mass immigration

The waves of immigrants currently flooding the Western world have burdened it with hordes of welfare parasites, brought in terrorists, increased crime, led to the proliferation of no-go areas and resulted in countless “bad neighbors” who, based on their alien upbringing, culture and traditions, lack any understanding and appreciation of liberty and are bound to become mindless future supporters of welfare-Statism.

No one is against immigration and immigrants *per se*. But immigration must be by invitation only. All immigrants must be productive people and hence, be barred from all domestic welfare payments. To ensure this, they or their inviting party must place a bond with the community in which they are to settle, and which is to be forfeited and lead to the immigrant’s deportation should he ever become a public burden. As well, every immigrant, inviting party or employer should not only pay for the immigrant’s upkeep or salary, but must also pay the residential community for the additional wear and tear of its public facilities associated with the immigrant’s presence, so as to avoid the socialization of any and all costs incurred with his settlement. Moreover, even before his admission, every potential immigrant invitee must be carefully screened and tested not only for his productivity but also for cultural affinity (or “good neighborliness”) – with the empirically predictable result of mostly, but by no means exclusively, western-white immigrant-candidates. And any known communist or socialist, of any color, denomination or country of origin, must be barred from permanent settlement – unless, that is, the community where the potential immigrant wants to settle officially sanctions the looting of its residents’ property by new, foreign arrivals, which is not very likely to say the least (even within already existing ‘commie’ communes).[^20]

#### Stop attacking, killing and bombing people in foreign countries

A main cause, even if by no means the only one, for the current invasion of Western countries by hordes of alien immigrants, are the wars initiated and conducted in the Middle East and elsewhere by the US’ ruling elites and their subordinate Western puppet-elites. As well, the by now seemingly ‘normal’ and ubiquitous terrorist attacks in the name of Islam across the Western world are in large measure the “blow-back” of these wars and the ensuing chaos throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa. There should be no hesitation to call these Western rulers what they are: murderers or accessories to mass murder. We must demand, and cry out loud instead for a foreign policy of strict non-interventionism. Withdraw from all international and supranational organizations such as the UN, NATO and the EU that intricate one country into the domestic affairs of another. Stop all government-to-government aid and prohibit all weapon sales to foreign States. Let it be *America First!, England First!, Germany First!, Italy First!*, and so on, i.e., each country trading with one another and no one interfering in anyone else’s domestic affairs.

#### Defund the ruling elites and its intellectual bodyguards

Expose and widely publicize the lavish salaries, perks, pensions, side-deals, bribes and hush monies received by the ruling elites: by the higher-ups in government and governmental bureaucracies, of supreme courts, central banks, secret services and spy agencies, by politicians, parliamentarians, party leaders, political advisors and consultants, by crony-capitalists, “public educrats,” university presidents, provosts and academic “stars.” Drive home the point that all their shining glory and luxury is funded by money extorted from tax-payers, and consequently urge that any and all taxes be slashed: income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, inheritance taxes, etc., etc..

#### End the FED and all central banks

The second source of funding for the ruling elites, besides the money extorted from the public in the form of taxes, comes from the central banks. Central banks are allowed to create paper money out of thin air. This reduces the purchasing power of money and destroys the savings of average people. It does not and cannot make society as a whole richer, but it redistributes income and wealth within society. The earliest receivers of the newly created money, i.e., the ruling elites, are thereby made richer and the later and latest receivers, i.e., the average citizen, are made poorer. The central bank’s manipulation of interest rates is the cause of boom-bust cycles. The central bank permits the accumulation of ever greater “public debt” that is shifted as a burden onto unknown future taxpayers or is simply inflated away. And as the facilitator of public debt, the central banks are also the facilitators of wars. This monstrosity must end and be replaced by a system of free, competitive banking built on the foundation of a genuine commodity money such as gold or silver.

#### Abolish all ‘affirmative action’ and ‘non-discrimination’ laws and regulations

All such edicts are blatant violations of the principle of the equality before the law that, at least in the West, is intuitively sensed and recognized as a fundamental principle of justice. As private property owners, people must be free to associate or disassociate with others: to include or exclude, to integrate or segregate, to join or separate, to unify and incorporate or to disunite, exit and secede. Close all university departments for Black-, Latino-, Women-, Gender-, Queer-Studies, etc., etc., as incompatible with science and dismiss its faculties as intellectual imposters or scoundrels. As well, demand that all affirmative action commissars, diversity and human resources officers, from universities on down to schools and kindergartens, be thrown out onto the street and be forced to learn some useful trade.

#### Crush the “Anti-Fascist” Mob

The trans-valuation of all values throughout the West: the invention of ever more “victim groups,” the spread of “affirmative action” programs and the relentless promotion of “political correctness,” has led to the rise of an “anti-fascist” mob. Tacitly supported and indirectly funded by the ruling elites, this self-described mob of “social justice warriors” has taken upon itself the task of escalating the fight against “white privilege” through deliberate acts of terror directed against anyone and anything deemed “racist,” “right-wing,” “fascist,” “reactionary,” “incorrigible” or “unreconstructed.” Such “enemies of progress” are physically assaulted by the “anti-fascist” mob, their cars are burnt down, their properties vandalized, and their employers threatened to dismiss them and ruin their careers – all the while the police are ordered by the powers that be to “stand down” and not to investigate the crimes committed or prosecute and punish the criminals. In view of this outrage, public anger must be aroused and there must be clamoring, far and wide, for the police to be unleashed and this mob be beaten into submission.[^21]

#### Crush the street criminals and gangs

In dispensing with the principle of the equality before the law and awarding all sorts of group privileges (except to the one group of married white Christian men and their families) the ruling elites have also dispensed with the principle of equal punishment for equal crime. Some State-favored groups are handed more lenient punishment for the same crime than others, and some especially favored groups are simply let run wild and go practically unpunished at all, thus actually and effectively promoting crime. As well, no-go areas have been permitted to develop where any effort at law-enforcement has essentially ceased to exist and where violent thugs and street gangs have taken over. In view of this, public furor must be provoked and it be unmistakably demanded that the police crack-down quick and hard on any robber, mugger, rapist and murderer, and ruthlessly clear all current no-go areas of violent gang-rule. Needless to say that this policy should be colorblind, but if it happens to be, as it in fact does, that most street criminals or gang members are young Black or Latino males or, in Europe, young immigrant males from Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans or Eastern Europe, then so be it and such human specimen then should be the ones that most prominently get their noses bloodied. And needless to say also that in order to defend against crime, whether ordinary street crime or acts of terrorism, all prohibitions against the ownership of guns by upstanding citizen should be abolished.

#### Get rid of all welfare parasites and bums

To cement their own position, the ruling class has put the underclass on the dole and thus made it a most reliable source of public support. Allegedly to help people rise and move up from the underclass to become self-supporting actors, the real – and actually intended – effect of the State’s so-called “social policy” is the exact opposite. It has rendered a person’s underclass status more permanent and made the underclass steadily grow (and with this also the number of tax-funded social workers and therapists assigned to “help and assist” it). For, in accordance with inexorable economic law, every subsidy awarded on account of some alleged need or deficiency produces more, not less, of the problem that it is supposed to alleviate or eliminate. Thus, the root cause of a person’s underclass status: his low impulse control and high time preference, i.e., his uncontrolled desire for immediate gratification, and the various attendant manifestations of this cause, such as unemployment, poverty, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, divorce, female headed households, out-of-wedlock births, rotating shack-up male companions, child abuse, negligence and petty crime, is and are not alleviated or eliminated but systematically strengthened and promoted. Instead of continuing and expanding this increasingly unsightly social disaster, then, it should be abolished and be loudly demanded that one take heed of the biblical exhortation that he who can, but will not work, also shall not eat, and that he who truly cannot work, due to severe mental or physical deficiencies, be taken care of by family, community and voluntary charity.

#### Get the State out of education

Most, if not all, social pathologies plaguing the contemporary West have their common root in the institution of “public education.” When the first steps were taken, more than two centuries ago, in Prussia, to supplement and ultimately replace a formerly completely private system of education with a universal system of compulsory “public education,” the time spent in State-run schools did in most cases not exceed four years. Today, throughout the entire Western world, the time spent in institutions of “public education” is, at a minimum, around ten years, and in many cases, and increasingly so, twenty or even thirty years. That is, a large or even the largest part of time during the most formative period in a person’s life is spent in State-funded and State-supervised institutions, whose primary purpose from the very beginning it was *not* to raise an enlightened public, but to train “good soldiers” and “good public servants:” not independent and mature or “mündige Bürger,” but subordinate and servile “Staats-Bürger.” The result? The indoctrination has worked: the longer the time a person has spent within the system of public education, the more he is committed to leftist-egalitarian ideas and has swallowed and wholeheartedly internalized the official doctrine and agenda of “political correctness.” Indeed, in particular among social science teachers and professors, people *not* counting themselves as part of the Left have practically ceased to exist. Consequently, it must be demanded that the control of schools and universities be wrest away from the central State and, in a first step, be returned to regional or better still local and locally funded authorities, and ultimately be completely privatized, so as to replace a system of compulsory uniformity and conformity with a system of decentralized education that reflects the natural variation, multiplicity and diversity of human talents and interests.

#### Don’t put your trust in politics or political parties

Just as *academia* and the academic world cannot be expected to play any significant role in a libertarian strategy for social change, so with politics and political parties – after all, it is the ultimate goal of libertarianism to put an end to all politics, and to subject all interpersonal relations and conflicts to private law and civil law procedures. To be sure, under present, all-pervasively politicized conditions an involvement in politics and party politics cannot be entirely avoided. However, in any such involvement one must be keenly aware of and guard against the corrupting influence of power and the lure of money and perks that comes with it. And to minimize this risk and temptation, it is advisable to concentrate one’s efforts on the level of regional and local rather than national politics, and there to promote a radical agenda of decentralization: of nullification and peaceful separation, segregation and secession. Most importantly, however, we must take heed of Ludwig von Mises’ life-motto: Do not give in to evil, but proceed ever more boldly against it. That is, we must speak out whenever and wherever, whether in formal or informal gatherings, against anyone affronting us with by now only all-too-familiar “politically correct” drivel and left-egalitarian balderdash and unmistakably say: “No. Hell no. You must be kidding.” In the meantime, given the almost complete mind-control exercised by the ruling elites, *academia* and the MSM, it already requires a good portion of courage to do so. But if we are not brave enough to do so now and thus set an example for others to follow, matters will become increasingly worse and more dangerous in the future, and we, Western civilization and the Western ideas of freedom and liberty will be wiped out and vanish.

[^20]: Brief message to all open-border and liberallala libertarians, who will surely label this, you guessed it, “fascist”: In a fully privatized libertarian order there exists no such thing as a right to free immigration. Private property implies borders and the owner’s right to exclude at will. And “public property” has borders as well. It is not unowned. It is the property of domestic tax-payers and most definitely not the property of foreigners. And while it is true that the State is a criminal organization and that to entrust it with the task of border control will inevitably result in numerous injustices to both domestic residents and foreigners, it is also true that the State *does something* also when it decides *not* to do anything about border control and that, under the present circumstances, doing nothing at all in this regard will lead to even more and much graver injustices, in particular to the domestic citizenry.

[^21]: Query for liberallala-libertarians and the Stupids for Liberty, who are sure to object to this demand on the ground that the police asked to crush the “anti-fascist” mob are *State-_police: Do you also object, on the same grounds, that the police arrest murderers or rapists? Aren’t these legitimate tasks performed also in any libertarian order by _private* police? And if the police are not to do anything about this mob, isn’t it o.k. then that the target of its attacks, the “racist Right,” should take the task upon itself of giving the “social justice warriors” a bloody nose?
