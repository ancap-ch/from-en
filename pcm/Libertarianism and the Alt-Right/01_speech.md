We sabi wetin happen to the term liberal and liberalism. E don dey attached to so many different people and different positons sotey e don lose all e meaning and don become empty label wey no go description. Na d same fate nai don dey threaten the term libertarian and libertarianism wey dem make to regain some of correct meaning wey don loss sake of say the former label pai.

Sha, the tori of modern libertarianism never mature. E begin for Murray Rothbard’s parlour and e discover e coded expression for e *For A New Liberty. A Libertarian manifesto*,wey com publish for 1973. So, Ah geh hope and no wan give up on libertarianism wey Rothbard don define and explain with the kain correctness wey person no go fit argue, despite the many many times wey so-called libertarians don try to rub potto potto and rip off the good name wey libertarianism get for something totally different.

The tori, wey nobody fit argue wey form the core of the libertarian doctrine dey simple and no get long talk and I don explain am tire for this place. If things no scarce for this world, kasala or more precise physical gbenge no go happen. Gbenge between people na always because say things no many reach. I wan do A with one thing and you wan do B with the same thing. Na because of this kain matter- plus say we get ability to relate and argue with ourselves – we dey find correct behavior wey go help us avoid gbenge. If we no wan avoid gbenge, e no go make sense to de find these correct behavior. We go just dey de burst kasala anyhow. 

For case wey e be say, we no get agreement for wetin we want, kasala wey concern say things no many we no go fit dey escape unless say the resources wey dey, dem  go give am as private, no-go area kind of property to some kain individual or group of individual dem. Na only for this kain case nai I go fit stand tanda with *my* own things, from you, with *your* own things, without say me and you get kasala. 

But who go get the small things wey dey as private property and who no go get? First: Each person get e own physical body wey only am and no one else dey control *directly*. And second, as for things wey no many wey we go fit control *only* indirectly[^1]: Exclusive control[^2] go fit become and fit dey assigned to the person, who use the property wey we dey reason *first* or who get am through voluntary[^3] exchange from e *previous* owner. Na only the first user of a resource[^4] nai go fit get and gain control over am wey say gbenge nor go dey, i.e., in peace. Else, if exclusive control con reach hand of *latecomers*, gbenge no go dey avoided but opposite of the main reason for the norms ,we no go fit avoid am and e go dey like that forever. 

Before all of una wey dey ontop this tori, ah no need to begin enter long talk except make ah add say: if you wan live in peace with oda people dem and avoid all the gbenge and, if say gbenge burst, try settle am in peace, then you go must be anarchist or to dey more accurate a private property anarchist, an anarcho-capitalist or person wey support private law society.

And e go con mean, then and again without too much talk: Person, anybody, *no* be libertarian or no mere *fake* libertarian who dey agree with and dey promote one or more of these things: say e go must get a State, any State, of  ‘public’ (State) property and of taxes so e go dey possible to live in peace: or say e go dey and we go fit judge am as true of any so-called “human rights” or “civil rights” wey no concern provate property rights, like “women right”, “gay rights”, “minority rights”,  the “right” wey person no fit look you down, the “right” wey you fit commot where you dey without limit, the “right” to sure minimum income or to get free health care, lor the “right” to get freedom from talk wey you no like and thought. People wey dey support all these fit call themselves wetin they like, and as libertarians we go fit cooperate with them, so long as such cooperation go ensure say e draw us close to the real goal, but them no be *libertarians* or only *fake* libertarians.

Ehen, “one funny thing happen as we dey come this forum”. While me and Rothbard, as we dey follow e example, we no deviate from the idea wey don form firm beliefs, no be just non-libertarians in particular also fake libertarians, i.e., people wey dem claim (falsely) say dem *be* libertarians, and even dose wey dey honest but wey no get the correct sense wey don select as wetin them like pass *bêtes noires* and descendants of evil. Rothbard, the *spiritus rector* of new libertarianism, don get name wey this so-called “anti-fascist” group am as person wey no like change, rascist, sexist, an authoritarian, person wey favor say na only elites go rule, person wey no like anything foreign, a fascist, and to top am, person wey dey hate himself sake of say him be Jewish Nazi. And I con inherit all of these honorary titles, plus even some wey dem add (except the one wey concern Jewish one thing). So wetin funny come happen here? 

To try develop answer to this question don carry me jam the topic of this talk: the relationship wey dey between libertarianism and the alternative right or “Alt-Right”, which don gather national and international bad name after Hillary Clinton, during the last presidential election campaign, single am as one of the inspiration behind wetin she call “basket of deplorable” support for Trump[^5].

The Alt-Right movement na actually pickin of the paleo-conservative movement wey people begin know for early 1990’s, wey get columnist and best-selling author Patrick Buchanian as e best-known rep. E con go down wey nothing happen during late 1990’s, and na now e don recently, sake of the constanr damage wey don dey happen to America and e rep by the rule of them Bush I, Clinton I, Bush II and Obama tenor,don come out strongly more than before under the new name of Alt-Right. Many of the people wey dey shine the light as dem associate with the Alt-Right don come here for the first meetings wey we hold as the years dey waka. Paul Gottfried, who first form the name, Peter Brimelow, Richard Lynn, Jared Taylor, John Derbyshire, Steve Sailer and Richard Spencer. Even self, dem don callSean Gabb and my name as e connect with Alt-Right, and my work self don dey linked close with the one wey relate with neo-reationary movement wey dey gingered by Curtis Yarvin[^6] and e blog wey no dey exist again wey e call *Unqualified Reservations*. To put am together, all these relation and associations don earn me many mention by America’s most repped smear-and-defamation league the SPLC[^7].

As e be so: Wetin con happen to the relationship wey dey between libertarianism and the Alt-Right and the reason why I invite chairmen of representatives of Alt-Right dem come meeting with libertarians? Libertarians dey united by the strong belief wey ah don mention before. They dey clear about wetin dem wan achieve. But libertarian doctrine no really mean much if we reason these questions: 

1. How we wan maintain libertarian order once we don achieve am;
2. How we wan attain a libertarian order from starting point wey no be libertarian, whey go require:
   1. Say the person go must describe this starting point;
   2. Correctly identify the obstacles wey don sey to block the way of padi libertarian end by this same  starting point.

To answer all dese questions so, together with wetin dem don talk, you go also need to know about human psychology and sociology or at least small common sense about wetin dem mean. Yet, many libertarians dem and fake libertarians don ignore human psychology and sociology or no evin geh common sense about dem. They just dey blindly accept, even when clear evidence dey, say everybody dey equally rich, gehb similar human nature, say everybody and all society and culture dey equal and you fit exchange them. 

While e dey possible to characterize enough of contemporary libertarianism, then, as theory and theorists without say we talk of psychology and sociology, many or even most of the Alt-Right go be dey explained, in opposite, as psychology and sociology without theory. Alt-Righters no get common theory wey dey guide dem, and nothing dey wey even resemble shikinle like canonical text wey dey define am. Instead, the Alt-Right dey united basically in d way dem describe the modern world, and in particular the US and the so-called Western World, and the way dem dey know and locate the problems wey dey for e social structure. In short, e don dey rightly noted say the Alt-Right dey far more united by wetin e dey fight that wetin e dey encourage. E dey against , and in fact, e hate with passion, the elites them wey dey control the State, the MSM and academia. Why? Because all of dem dey encourage say may standard no dey and make different wrongs dey. And so, dem they promote,while the Alt-Right dey fight badly, egalitarianism, affirmative action[^8],multiculturalism and “free” mass movement from places as a way to take bring about multiculturalism. Also, the Alt-Right come hate everything  wey dey injure cultural Marxism or Gramsciism and all so called “political correctness” and with sense, e dey commot , without excuse, every accusations say e dey racist,sexist,elitist, supremacist, homophobe, xenophobe, etc., etc. And the Alt-Right also dey laugh as wetin no go survive the learner of programmatic motto of so-called libertarians such as the _ for Liberty_[^9] of “Peace, Love, and Liberty”, wey dem correctly  translate into German by Lichtschlag as “Friede, Freude, Eierkuchen”. In very clear opposite to this one,Alt-Righters dem put leg for ground say life also dey about strife, hate, struggle and fight, not just between people dem but also dey among different group of people wey dey act together. “_Millennial Woes”_[^10] done sharparly summarize the Alt-Right as:

>Equality na nonsense. Herierachy dey important. Races dey different. The sexes dey different. Morality gats value and degeneracy dey real. All culture no dey equal and we no dey under pressure to think say dem dey like that. Man na fallen creature and this life no just be about hollow materialism. Last last, the white race geh rep, and civilization dey precious. Na dis be d Alt-right.

Wey no unifying theory con dey, the argument go dey less among the Alt+Right  concerning the goal wey they wan achieve last last. Many of the leaders dem geh some kind liking for libertarians, most especially dose wey don come here[^11], even if dem no b am 100% and no go wan see themselves like that. All Alt-Righters wey don show here, for example, dey familiar with Rothbard and e work, all dis time d most new presidential candidate for Libertarian party never even hear of Rothbard name, and all fo them , as far as I know, dem blow  Ron Paul whistle during e primary campaign for the Republican Party to nominate am as presidential candidate, all dis time many people wey call themselves libertarians dey attack and try to match Ron Paul for neck sake of say e get – you know wetin ah wan talk already- na “racisist” views.

Make e for no lost, many of the Alt-Right leaders and plenty of e committed followers don encourage views wey no gel with libertarianism. Like Buchanan before and Trump now, dem get stubborn-head concerning make dem support policy wey dey restrictive, wey dey select well well and dey discriminate immigration[^12] with iron-hand policy wey restrict trade,economic protectionism and protective tariffs[^13].[^14]

Others don waka comot far, person like Richard Spencer, wey first make the term Alt-Right popular. For now sha, sake of recent publicity stunts, wey don dey gather bad blood for US, Spencer don claim rank of maximum leader of wetin e assume as mighty unified movement[^15]. When Spencer come here, some years ago,e still be like who dey strong as libertarian. Unfortunately, e don change and Spencer don wash hand comot, without any qualification at all, all libertarians and everthing wey concern libertarian and e don even go as far as to stand for socialism, as long as na socialism of and only for white people. See heavy disappointment!

As e be say no theoretical foundation dey, this division of Alt-Right into enemy sets no go dey too surprising. Yet that one no mean say make person overlook am, because the Alt-Right don bring many ideas wey geh value to take try answer the two question wey we don mention before wey libertarian theory no answer: of how we wan maintain libertarian social order and how e go dey possible to achieve dat kind order from the present, as e b un-libertarian status quo. The Alt-Right no discover these ideas. They don dey ground ever since and true true, large part no pass common sense. But recently those kind ideas don dey buried under mountains of egalitarian, leftist propaganda and credit must go to Alt-Right sake of say na dem bring am come light back.

To show say dat kind thinking geh value, make ah answer the first unanswered question first.

Many libertarians geh d view say all wetin we need to maintain a libertarian social order na to use iron face enforce he non-aggression principle (NAP). If e no happen, as long as people dey stay clear of aggression, according to this their view, the principle of “live and let live” go work. Still, while e look say this “live and let live” dey sound as if e make sense for pickin dem wey dey disobey parent’s power and all social accepted behavior and control[^16], and while e dey correct say d principle dey work for [people wey no dey stay together or wey no dey relate directly and from far, e *no* work or apply , or rather e dey *insufficient*, when e come to people wey dey stay close to each other, as neighbours and people wey dey stay the same community.


One simple example dey enough to make a point. Just imagine say you geh one new next-door neighbour. The neighbour no dey mess you or your property up in any way, but na bad neighbour. He dey dirty e own neighbouring property, turn am to refuse dump; for outside wey you fit see, e dey do some kind ritual wey make am dey kill animals, e don turn e house to “Freudenhaus”, a bordello, with customers wey dey come steady day and night; e no dey ever offer to help and no dey ever keep e promise or even to speak for langua wey you get. Etc., etc.. Your life don turn nightmare. Yet you no fit mess am up as e never really jonx come your side. Wetin you fit do? You fit shun am or put am for one corner. But your neighbour no care, and in any case you on your own 'punishing' am no go make any difference to am. You gats get the communal respect and authority, or meet person who get am, to cajole everybody or at least many of the people for the area make dem make the neighbour a social outcast, so that pressure go dey on am to sell e property and move ahead. 

Wetin be the lesson? For neighbours and people wey geh direct regular contact with each other for one cabal to dey one place live in peace – a quiet and friendly place wey dem fit run parole like paddy - need say dem go get common culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. E go dey possible for different cultures to run dey together on distant level, cribs wey no near, but multi-culturalism, cultures wey dey different, no go fit dey for the same place and zone wey no go see reduced trust, increased pressure, and finally the call for "strong man" and the fall down of anything wey be like libertarian social order. 

And before nkor: just as libertarian order gats dey on guard against "bad" (even if e no dey aggressive) neighbours through say dem put am for corner, i.e., by common "you no dey wanted here" culture, so, and even more watchful like that, so e go must dey guarded against neighbours who go openly dey advocate for communism, socialism, syndicalism or democracy in any shape or form. They, as e be say dem dey pose as threat to all private property and property owners, must no only dey for one corner, but they must, to use one well-known Hoppe-meme, "commot physically," if e warrant am by gbenge, and force dem to go look for better place. To no do am last last go lead to - well, communism, socialism, syndicalism or democracy and hence, the very opposite of libertarian social order.

With these rightist” or as ah go put am, plain common sense kind of ideas for mind ah dey turn now to the question wey dey more challenging of how we go commot from here, the status quo, to the other side. And for this e fit dey instructive to first sharparly consider the answer wey don come by liberallala, the peace-love-and-liberty, the Friede-Freude-Eierkuchen or the capitalism-is-love libertarians. E don expose the same fundamental egalitarianism, even if na slightly different form, as the kind wey dey show up for the the live-and-let-live libertarians. Na these ones as ah don try to explain, nai define wetin we fit call the "bad neighbour problem" - and wetin be mere short-hand for the overall problem wey dey show face by reason of coexistence of different alien wey dey clear, mutually disturbing, annoying, strange or behaviour wey dey jonx - simply sake of say e dey exist. And true true, if you assume, against all correct evidence with proof, say everybody, everywhere, dey essential the same, then, as per definition, nothing like "bad neighbour problem" dey exist. 

The same egalitarian,  or as the liberallala-libertarians themselves prefer to call am, "humanitarian" spirit also come show face for the answer to the question of a libertarian strategy. To put am together, their advice na say: dey nice and yearn everybody - and then, for future things, na the better libertarian argument go win. To show am, take my forme-friend-turned-foe Jeffrey Tucker’s five “Don’ts When Talking Liberty”. Dem be:

no dey aggressive ;
no dey presume say you hate liberty ;
no dey presume different goals ;
no dey presume ignorance ;
no dey regard anybody as enemy. "

Now, apart from the fact say Tucker no seem to dey follow e own advice for e aggressive condemnation of the entire Alt-Right as liberty-hating fascists, ah dey also find e exhortation truly astounding. Dem go look like good advice in relation to people wey go just come out from nowhere, wey no geh history wey person fit trace at all, but in regard to real people wey get history wey look me for face as hopelessly naïve, no dey real and damn unproductive as we dey pursue libertarian end. See me (and I wan assume everybody here) know and don meet people for my life who no know, who geh different, un-libertarian goals, and who no hate liberty wey libertarians dey think - and why for this world ah no go hate an dey aggressive towards my enemies? 

As a libertarian strategy, e go be say, Tucker advice must dey regarded simple, as bad joke. But surely na good advice if person dey try enter the State as one kind "libertarian" advisor, and this go fit explain the joy wey Tucker "humanitarian" libertarianism don dey embraced by the entire liberallala-libertarian people. 

Wey we no dey reason egalitarian phantasy lands, for the other side, for the real world, libertarians must above every other thing dey realistic and recognise from the beginning, as the Alt-Right dey do, say the inequality wey dey not just between individuals but different cultures na part of human existence wey we no fit comot. We must also know say plenty enemies of liberty dey as libertarianism don define and that na dem, no be us, dey in charge of many world affairs; that for many part of the modern world na dem dey control the entire population so tey the idea of liberty and of libertarian social order never even reach some people ear and many consider am as unthinkable[^18]; and say na majorly for West, for countries wey dey Western and Central Europe and the land wey the people dey, nai the idea of liberty geh strong root and na for there nai we go fit challenge these enemies openly. And to concentrate our strategic considerations only for West, then, nai we go fit identify, almost as the Alt-Right don do effectively, these actors and agencies as our main enemies. 

Dem be:

1.  The people wey be elites wey dey in control of the State apparatus and particularly the "Deep State" or the so-called "Cathedral" wey d military get, the secret services, the central banks and the supreme courts. To add, dem include :
::::1.	The leaders of the military-industrial complex, i.e., of small private firm wey dey owe their existence to the State as the only or dominant buyer of their products;
::::2.	The people wey dey lead commercial banks, wey owe their privilege of creating money and credit from air to the existence of central bank and e role as "lender of last resort". Na dem together, then, State, Big-Business and Big-banking nai form d very powerful even though them small "mutual admiration society" wey don come together to rob huge population of tax-payers and con dey live big for their head. 
2. ([A] group of enemies wey dey even bigger dey made up of) the intellectuals, educators and "educrats," wey come from the highest level of academics down to the level of primary school and kindergartens. Funded almost single-handedly, whether na direct or indirect, by the State, dem, for their majority wey dey like bully, don become the soft tools and executioners wey dey willing for the hand of the ruling elites dem and even don dey designed for total power and control. 
3.  Dem journalists for MSM, wey be the weak products of the system of "public education, " and the coward people wey dey collect and whistle make everybody hear government "information."

Wetin also dey as important for the development of libertarian strategy na con the next question wey go follow sharparly: who be the *victims*? The standard libertarian answer for this na: the tax-*payers* compared to the tax-*consumers*. Yet while this is essentially correct, at best na only part of the answer, and libertarians fit learn something regarding this matter  from the Alt-Right:

To take expand and increase e power, the ruling elites don dey conduct for many decades wetin Pat Buchanan don identify as systematic “culture war”, wey dey look for trans-valuation of every values and the fall down of every natural, or if you go agree “organic” social bonds and institutions like families, communities, ethnic groups and genealogically related nations, so e go fit create an atomized populace wey don increase, wey be say the only thing wey dem get in common and wey dey bind dem na  common existential dependency for  the State. The first step for this direction, wey dem don take already half a century or even longer ago, na  the introduction of “public welfare” and “social security”. As e be, the underclass and the elderly con turn to State-dependents and the value and importance of family and community for the same way con reduce and con dey weak. Now wey e never tey, steps wey go carry us far for this direction don dey happen. A new “victimology” don dey geh voice and advertised. Women, particularly single mothers, Blacks, Browns, Latinos, homosexuals, lesbians, bi- and transsexuals don get  award for “victim” status and e don get legal privileges wey come from non-discrimination or affirmative action decrees. Also eh, just nw that kind privileges don dey expanded also to foreign-national immigrants, whether legal or illegal, so long as  as they fall for one of the categories wey I just mention or don be members of non-Christian religions such as Islam, for example, Wetin be the result? No be only say wetin ah mention earlier “bad neighbor problem” never dey avoided or solved, but don dey systematically promoted and don get vibes instead. Cultural homogeneity don yapata, and the freedom to associate, and the voluntary physical segregation and separation of different people, communities, cultures and traditions don dey replaced by one kind forceful wey dey force people to dey together. By the way self, each “victim” group wey ah don mention don dey pitted against all others, and all of them don put leg for ground against white, heterosexual, Christian males and in particular those wey don marry and with children as the only remaining, legally un-protected group of so-called “victimizers”. As e don be, wetin don happen sake of say the trans-valuation of all values wey don dey promoted by the ruling elites, the world don dey turned upside down. The institution of a family household wey be father, mother and their children wey don form the basis of Western civilization, as the freest, most industrious, ingenious and all-around accomplished civilization wey humans know o, i.e., the institution gan and people wey don do the most good for human history, don dey officially stigmatized and vilified as where all the bad things for dey come and don become the highest disadvantaged, even group wey don suffer for the hand of the enemy elites’ policy wey no get break *divide et impera*.

Like that eh, as you see wetin be the current arrangement of matter, any libertarian strategy wey go make sense must, mostly as the Alt-right don recognize:

1. Arrange yourself and talk well for where this group of the most severely victimized people dey. White married Christian couples wey get pickin, in particular if they also join the class of tax-*payers* (instead of tax-consumers), and everybody wey dey  resemble or aspire closely to this standard form of social order and organization go fit dey legitly expected say e go be the person wey go everly accept the libertarian message[^19]. As we get this arrangement of perpetrator-enemies vs. victims in the contemporary West, then, I go fit enter to the final task wey be to try list out a realistic libertarian strategy for change. The main part wey go dey back of two general considerations. . For one,  as e be say the class of intellectuals from the tops of *academia* to the opinion-molding journalists for the MSM dey funded by and firmly tied into the ruling system, i.e., that dem be part of the *problem*,  make them also no expect them to play a major if any role for the problem *solution*. Like that eh, the so-called Hayekian strategy for social change, wey dey reason the spread of correct libertarian ideas wey go start for top, with the leading philosophers, and go come dey flow down small small  from there to journalists and finally go reach the great unwashed masses, gats dey considered as fundamentally unrealistic. Instead, any realistic libertarian strategy for change gats be *populist* strategy. That is, libertarians gats find way to comot the dominant intellectual elites and yearn the masses directly to ginger dem make them vex and get hatred for the ruling elites.
2. Every time the main people wey dey hear one populist libertarian message go must truly be groups of dispossessed and disenfranchised native whites as I just yearn, I believe am to be serious strategic mistake to go make “whiteness” the only requirement wey person go rest e strategic decisions, as some people for Alt-Right don suggest make e be. After all, na white men wey dey top wey make up the ruling elite and na dem don carry the current mess put for our head. True true, the different  protected “minorities” wey ah don yearn before dey take full advantage of the legal privileges wey don dey accorded and they don dey get plenty mind to dey ask for more “protection”, but nobody among them and all of them together no get that time and even now no get the intellectual prowess wey for make this outcome possible, if no be the instrumental help wey they don receive and still dey receive from white men.

Now, to reason  tip from the Buchanan-, the Paul- and the Trump-movement, to knack the main thing for the populist strategy for libertarian change, for no special order except the one wey come first, wey don kack as the greatest urgency in the public mind.

#### Stop make plenty people dey comot once

The wave of people wey dey comot from their side enter Western world go don overload am with the load of welfare parasites, bring in terrorist, increase crime, don lead to the establshment of no-go areas and don show face for countless “bad neighbors” who because of the kind training wey dem receive, culture and traditions, no get any understanding and appreciation of liberty wey go must become future supporters of welfare-Statism wey no get mind.

Nobody dey against immigration and immigrants *per se*. But immigration gats dey by invitation only. All immigrants gats be productive people and like that, go dey barred from all domestic welfare payments. . To make sure say e happen, they or their inviting party gats place rapport with the community wey dem wan settle, and wey go leave e hand and result for immigrant’s deportation if e go ever become public burden. Also eh, every immigrant, inviting party or employer gats not only pay for the immigrant’s upkeep or salary, but go must also pay the community wey e dey stay for the additional wear and tear of e public facilities wey dey associated with the immigrant’s presence, so e fit avoid the socialization of any and every costs wey go come in as e dey settle. As e be so, even before e dey accepted , every potential immigrant invitee go must dey carefully screened and tested no be only for e productivity but sake of say e get cultural rep (or “good neighborliness”) – with wetin we don know as we observe say we fit  predict mostly, but no be say na only, western-white immigrant-candidates. And any communist or socialist wey get vibes, of any color, denomination or country of origin, must dey barred from permanent settlement – unless, that is, the community wey the potential immigrant wan  settle down officially allow make dem  loot e residents  property by new people wey just come, wey no dey likely to happen and that na to even close mouth talk (even for  ‘commie’ communes wey don dey).[^20]

#### Stop to dey attack, dey kill and dey bomb people for obodo oyinbo countries

One main cause, even if no be the only one, wey dey see the current movement of people for large numbers enter Western countries from other countries, na the war wey dey trigger and dey happen for the Middle East and some other places by US ruling elites them and people wey dem dey control, Western puppet-elites. Even self, the one wey don dey look 'normal' and terrorist attacks wey dey happen everywhere sake of say na Islam across the Western world for large matter na "blow-back" from the wars and the resulting crisis wey dey burst all through Middle East and Northern Africa. No hesitation supposed dey to call these Western rulers wetin dem be: murder and people wey dey assist killing of plenty people. We gats ask, and cry out loud instead make dem give us foreign policy wey support strict non-interventionism. Comot from all international and supranational organizations like dem UN, NATO and the EU wey dey make one country shook mouth put for the domestic affairs of another one. Stop all government-to-government aid and ban all the selling of weapon to foreign States. Make e be *America First!, England First!, Germany First!, Italy First!*, and so on, i.e., each country go dey trade with one another and no body go shook mouth for anybody domestic affairs.

#### Comot money from ruling elites hand and e intellectual bodyguards

Expose and dey spread news concerning the big salaries, perks, pensions, side-deals, bribes and hush monies wey the ruling elites dey collect: by those wey dey higher-up for government and governmental bureaucracies, of supreme courts, central banks, secret services and spy agencies, by politicians, parliamentarians, party leaders, political advisors and consultants, by crony-capitalists, “public educrats”, university presidents, provosts and academic “stars”.Make sure say e clear say all their shining glory and luxury dey come from money wey dem dey extort from tax-payers, and after that, con advise say any and every tax gats reduce: income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, inheritance taxes, etc., etc..

#### Comot the FED and all central banks

The second way wey funds dey reach the ruling elites, besides the money wey dem extorte from the public in the form of taxes, dey come from the central banks. Central banks geh power to create paper money from thin air. This dey reduce power  of money to buy and dey destroy the money wey average people don save. E no dey and no fit make society as a whole richer, but e dey redistributes income and wealth among society. The people wey dey collect the money as dem make am i.e., the ruling elites, go con dey  richer and the later and latest receivers, i.e., the average citizen, go dey poorer. The central bank way of manipulating the interest rates nai dey cause boom-bust cycles. The central bank dey allow the gathering of “public debt” wey dey always increase and go con shift the burden give  unknown future taxpayers or go simply inflate am comot. And as people wey dey promote public debt, the central banks nai also be the facilitators of wars. This big evil go must end and go need to dey replaced by a system of free, competitive banking wey take shape for the foundation of genuine commodity money like gold or silver.

#### Ban all ‘affirmative action’ and ‘non-discrimination’ laws and regulations

All those kind edicts na pure violations of the principle of the equality before the law wey, at least for the West, dey reasonable and dey recognized as a fundamental principle of justice. As private property owners, people gats dey free to associate or pack face with others: to include or exclude, to add or comot from, to join or separate, to unify and incorporate or to disunite, exit and secede. Close all university departments for Black-, Latino-, Women-, Gender-, Queer-Studies, etc., etc., as e no gel with science and pack up all dem faculties say dem be intellectual imposters or scoundrels. Even self, demand say make all affirmative action commissars, diversity and human resources officers, from universities on down to schools and kindergartens, make dem troway dem for the street and make dem dey forced to learn some useful trade.

#### Match the “Anti-Fascist” Mob for ground

The trans-valuation of all values wey dey the West: the making of more and more “victim groups”, the spread of “affirmative action” programs and the every time  promotion of “political correctness”, don lead to therise of “anti-fascist” mob. As dem dey get support and funding indirectly from the ruling elites, this mob as them call theirselve, of “social justice warriors” don put am for head say dem go put fuel for the fight against “white privilege” through acts of terrorwey dem go purposely direct against anybody and anything wey dem reason say na “racist”, “right-wing”, “fascist”, “reactionary”, “incorrigible” or “unreconstructed”. That kind “enemies of progress” dey collect raw beating from the “anti-fascist” mob, dem dey burn their cars, seize their property, and their employers dey threaten to sack them and put sand sand for their their careers – all this time police dey receive orders from the ogas at the top to “stand down” and make dem no investigate the crimes wey dem don commit or even prosecute and punish the criminals. As dem dey see wetin dey happen, the anger of the public gats ginger and they must dey protest everywhere, make dem release the police and make dem  rugged this mob be beaten sotey dem go submit.[^21]

#### Match down the street criminals and gangs

As dem don comot the principle of the equality before the law and awarding all sorts of group privileges (except for  the one group wey involve married white Christian men and their families) the ruling elites don also comot the principle of equal punishment for equal crime. . Some groups wey State dey favor dey get lighter punishment than other people wey commit the same crime, and some special groups wey dem favor well dey roam about and no go serve punishment at all, and na so dem take dey promote crime well well. Even self, dem don allow make no-go areas gather energy wey no law-enforcement dey exist and where violent thugs and street gangs don take over. As e be so, public furor gats dey  provoked and go dey plan say make police crack-down quick and hard on any robber, mugger, rapist and murderer, and make dem without mercy clear all current no-go areas wey don dey observe violent gang-rule. I no need to talk say this policy gats dey colorblind, but if e happen say, and na so e even be, say most street criminals or gang members na young Black or Latino males or, in Europe, dem be young immigrant males from Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans or Eastern Europe, then make e be like that and these exhibit nai go most likely use head suffer am. And I no need to also talk say in order to defend against crime, whether ordinary street crime or acts of terrorism, every ban wey dey against ownership of guns by upstanding citizen gats clear.

#### Comot every welfare parasites and bum

To take mark down their own position, the ruling class don dey press the hand of the underclass and this one don make am surest source of public support. Wey dem talk say na to help people rise and move up from the underclass to become self-supporting actors, the real – and actual plan – effect of the State’s so-called “social policy” na the exact opposite. E don make person underclass status more permanent and don make the underclass to dey grow steadily (and na so the number of tax-funded social workers and therapists assigned to “help and assist” am don grow too). For, to follow the economic law wey no dey change, every subsidy wey dem award on account of some alleged need or deficiency go produce more, no be less, of the problem wey e supposed alleviate or eliminate. As e be so, the root cause of person underclass status: e low impulse control and high time preference, i.e., e desire for immediate jollification wey e no fit control, and the various attendant manifestations of this cause, wey be  unemployment, poverty, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, divorce, households wey female dey rule, pikin wey dem born out-of-wedlock, rotating shack-up male companions, child abuse, negligence and petty crime, dey and dem no dey no improve or comot but con dey systematically strengthened and promoted. Instead of to continue dey expand this dirty social disaster wey dey increase more more, then, e gats dey abolished and make dem demand loudly say make dem obey the biblical exhortation say person wey fit, but no wan work, make e no eat, and person wey true true no fit work, due to severe mental or physical deficiencies, make e get care from family, community and voluntary charity.

#### Comot de State from education

Nearly all, if nor be all self, social sickness wey dey plague de cometemporary West get common root wey dey for de institution of “public education”. When dem take de first step, more dan two centuries ago, for Prussia, to assist and last last replace a formerly completely private system of education with a universal system of compulsory “public education”, de time wey person dey spend for State-run schools nor dey pass four years for most cases. Today, everywhere for de entire Western world, de time wey people dey spend for institutions of “public education” na, say nor do, around ten years, and for many cases, and even more self, twenty or even thirty years. Dat’s ehn, large abi na  even de largest part of time during de most formative period for guyman life na for inside State-funded and State-supervised institutions, wey be say deir primary purpose from de very beginning *nor* be to raise an public wey sabi, but to train “good soldiers” and “good public servants:” nort be those wey be dey deir lane and mature or “mündige Bürger”, but subordinate and servile “Staats-Bürger”. Wetin come be scores? De indoctrination don work: de longer de time wey person don spend inside de system of public education, de more he dey committed to leftist-egalitarian ideas and don swallow and with all e heart master de official doctrine and agenda of “political correctness”.  Really, especially among social science teachers and professors, people  wey *nor*dey  count demselves as part of de Left don finish pata pata. As e be so, dey gats require make dem remove de cometrol of schools and universities from de central State and, first first, make dem return am give regional or better still local and locally funded authorities, and last last, make dem completely privatize am, so dat e go replace de  system of compulsory uniformity and comeformity put system wey get decentralized education wey dey reflect de natural variation, multiplicity and diversity of human talents and interests.

#### Nor dey trust politics and political parties

Just as we nor fit expect make de *academia* and de academic world play any significant role for  libertarian strategy for social change, na same thing with politics and political parties – after all, de thing wey libertarianism wan achieve na to put an end to all politics, and to make sure say all interpersonal relations and comeflicts dey loyal for  private law and civil law procedures. To dey sure, as we dey yearn, all-pervasively politicized comeditions and involvement in politics and party politics nor go fit dey completely avoided. Sha, as person dey shook head for this mara, e gats dey sharp to knorw and get protection against de power wey influence dey get to corrupt and de wey money take dey lure person do anyhow.  And e wan reduce risk and temptation, man gats comecentrate e efforts for de level of regional and local instead of national politics, and make e promote a radical agenda of decentralization: of nullification and peaceful separation, segregation and secession. De one wey dey important pass, sha, we gats follow Ludwig von Mises’ life-motto: Nor dey do evil, but challenege am  with boldness. Dat’s, we gats talk  speak out anytime and anywhere, wheder na for formal or informal gaderings, against anybody wey dey try us with wetin we don come to knorw as “politically correct” drivel and left-egalitarian rubbish and without shame say: “Nor. Hell nor. You dey joke”.  As e be so norw eh, sake of wetin be de almost complete mind-cometrol exercised by de ruling elites, *academia* and de MSM, e go require correct amount of mind to do am. But if we nor get enorugh mind to do so norw and so set  example make oders follow, de matter go dey worse and go become more dangerous for future, and we, Western civilization and de Western ideas of freedom and liberty go flush comot and disappear.

[^20]: This na short message to all open-border and liberallala libertarians, who go surely label this, you knorw na, “fascist”: For fully privatized libertarian order northing like a right to free immigration dey exist. Private property dey with borders and de owner’s right to exclude at will. E nor dey without owner. Na de property of domestic tax-payers and surely nor be property of foreigners. And while e dey true say de State na criminal organization and say to give dem de task to cometrol border go without mistake lead to numerous injustices for both domestic residents and foreigners, e also dey true say State *dey do something* also when e decide say e *nor* go do anytin about border cometrol and say, under de comedition wey we dey face so, to nor do anytin at all for this matter go lead to even more and much graver injustices, in particular to de domestic citizenry.

[^21]: Query for liberallala-libertarians and de Stupids for Liberty, who go surely kick against de demand wey dey on board say de police wey dem ask to quench de “anti-fascist” mob na *State-_police: You dey also object, for de same level, say de police dey arrest murderers or rapists? All this one nor be legitimate tasks wey dey happen for any libertarian order by _private* police? And if de police nor go do anytin about this mob, e nor dey o.k. den say make de target of e attacks, de “racist Right”, make dem take de task upon deirselves to  show de “social justice warriors” blood?
