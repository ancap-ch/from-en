### On de Indefensibility of Welfare Rights 

[^0]: Reply to David Conway, “A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism”, *Austrian Economics Newsletter* (Winter/Spring, 1990).

David Conway claims say my argument wey intend to show de unrestricted validity of de homesteading principle, i.e., de first-use-first-own rule regarding unowned, nature-given resources, dey flawed, and say e fit demonstrate de defensibility of welfare rights. I remain unconvinced and contend say na e counterargument nai dey faulty. 

While I nor get quarrel with e presentation of my argument, I go first briefly restate my proof. Second, I go point out de central errors for e reply. Third, I wish to offer explanation for Conway rejection of my argument as say e dey come from a rather common misconception regarding de logic of ethical reasoning.

Whether or not person get any rights, and, if any, which ones, go only fit dey decided for de course of argumentation. E deg impossible to deny ds truth of dis witout falling into a contradiction. Arguing dey require  person exclusive control (ownership) over scarce resources (person brain, vocal cords, etc.). Denying dis go  again merely prove de point. Further,  person gats  acquire sis ownership simply by virtue of de fact say he start to use dese resources before anybody do am; odawise, he nor go ever talk or argue anytin to start with. So, anybody wey dey deny de validity of de homesteading principle at least wit respect to *some* resources go contradict de content of e proposition thru e own act of proposition making. So far, e don appear, Conway go agree. But he gl impose limitations on de range of objects wey fit legitimately dey homesteaded. Unfortunately for Conway case, howeva, once exclusive control over some homesteaded means dey admitted as justified, e go dey impossible to justify any restrictions for de homesteading process—except for a self-imposed, voluntary one—witout as e come be running into contradictions. For if de proponent of that kind restriction bin dey consistent, he for fit justify control only over some, altho limited, scarce resources wey e for nor dey allowed to employ for additional homesteading. Yet obviously, he nor fit den interfere wit another person extended homesteading simply because of  e own lack of means to do anytin about tam. And if he don interfere, he go as e be (inconsistently) extend e ownership claims beyond e own justly homesteaded resources. Moreova, in order to justify e interference he go get to invoke a principle of property acquisition incompatible with de homesteading principle: He go nid to claim (inconsistently) say a person wey extend e homesteading, and who do sam in accordance wit a principle say nobody fit argue to dey generally invalid, na, or at least fit be, an aggressor (even tho in doing so dis person nor go possibly dey said to don take anytin away from anybody because he for don merely appropriate *previously unowned resources*, i.e., tins wey nobody up to dat point don even recognize as scarce and wey anybody else fit don appropriate as well if only him don  recognized dia scarcity earlier, including anybody such as Conway, who be dey concerned about de fate of late-comers and be wan preserve dese resources for dia later benefit). To go further, say person wey interfere with dat kind action and wey do am in accordance wit a principle say nobody fit possibly argue to dey generally valid na, or at least fit be, acting legitimately (even tho he go always take sometin away from somebody wey e appropriations happen wey nobody sweat put).

De central error for Conway rejection of dis argument na e refusal to acknowledge de logical incompatibility of e idea of welfare rights on de one hand—de notion say person fit get enforceable claims against homesteaders—and of de homesteading principle on de oda. Either de first idea dey right or de second go be. Howeva, person nor fit say de first nor fit dey right bcos in order for anybody to say so, de second one gats dey presupposed as valid. Dere nor fit be any thing like a right to life, den, in Conway’s sense of a right to having one’s life sustained by odas. Dere fit only dey each person right to get e physical body, and everytin homesteaded with e help, and to engage in mutually beneficial exchanges wit odas. Suppose, for instance, say I dey terminally ill and de only way for me to survive na to get my brain short-circuited wit Conway own.  He get de right to refuse? I tink so, and I dey sure say he tinks so, too. But he nor fit get dis right on welfare grounds (assuming say e life nor go dey threatened by dat kind operation), but only on de basis of de homesteading principle as de precondition of person existence as an independently reasoning and arguing physical being. Further, e claim say welfare rights dey “every bit as objective” as dose wey dey implied by mixing person labor with scarce resources (contrary to my thesis say de former dey subjective, arbitrary, verbal, derived out of thin air) dey fallacious. Thru homesteading an objective link between a *particular person* and a *particular resource* dey created. But how for dis world person fit say dat my need fit give rise to a claim regarding any specific resource or resource owner X, rada dan Y, or Z, if I neva homestead or produce any of dem?! Nor be  only say neediness dey incapable of objective identification or measurement: Who dey determine who dey or nor dey needy? Everyone for himself? But what if I happen to disagree wit anoda person self-assessment? People don't  die from love-sickness. Dem get right to a lover-conscript? People don survive by eating grass, bark, rats, roaches, or oda garbage. Needy people nor dey den so long as enough grass or garbage dey to eat? If not, why not? For how long de support for de needy go last? Foreva? And what about de rights of de supporters who go dereby become permanently enslaved to de needy? Or what if my support for de needy cause me to become needy myself, or somehow increase my own future needs? I go still need to continue to support dem? And how much work I fit expect de destitute to perform in return for my support, given de fact say person nor dey deal here wit a mutually beneficial employment relation or voluntary charity to begin wit? As much as de needy feel dey appropriate?

Moreova, even if all dese difficulties bin dey overcome, more dey wait for de wings bcos need nor dey connect de needy wit any resource or resource owner in particular, yet it gats invariably be particular resources wey dey provide relief. De needy fit dey needy witout any fault of dia own, but de non-needy fit dey non-needy witout any fault of dia own, too. So how de needy fit claim support from me rada dan from you? Surely dat one go dey utterly unfair toward me in particular! In fact, either de needy fit get claim against nobody in particular, wey go mean say dem nor get claim whatsoeva; or else dia claim go need to dey directed equally against each one of de world non-needy.

Yet how de needy go fit possibly enforce dat kind claim? After all, dem lack resources. For dis to dey possible, an all-resourceful, worldwide operating agency go dey required. De owners of dat kind agency obviously give need to dey classified as among de non-needy and fit hence get no direct claim against anyone. Supposedly, na only need dey create dat kind claims. In fact, dis agency go nid to dey considered one of de foremost debtors to de needy, and e fit only legitimately act against oda non-needy if e don previously voluntarily pay *e* share of welfare debts *and* de needy don contractually entrust am wit dat kind enforcement task. Hence, de welfare problem go nid to wait for a solution until dis institution arrive. So far e neva arrive, and notin dey to indicate say e go arrive for de near future. Even e happen, welfare rights go still dey incompatible wit d homesteading rule as an indisputably valid, axiomatic principle.

De explanation for Conway’s refusal to accept de homesteading ethic dey de misconception regarding de nature of ethical theory. Instead of recognizing ethics as a logical theory, deductively derived from incontestable axioms (akin to praxeology), Conway dey implicitly share a popular, empiricist-intuitionist (or gut-feeling) approach toward ethics. Accordingly, ethical theory dey *tested* against moral experience such dat if de theory yield conclusions wey dey different from person moral intuitions, e gats dey regarded as falsified. Howeva, dis view dey entirely mistaken and, much like for economics, de role of theory and experience in ethics dey almost precisely de opposite: Na de very function of ethical theory to provide  rational justification for we own moral intuitions, or to show why dem nor get that kind basis and make us reconsider and revise our intuitive reactions. Dis nor be to say  intuitions nor fit play role for de building of ethical theory. In fact, counterintuitive theoretical conclusions fit well *indicate* a theoretical error. But if after person theoretical reexamination errors nor dey found in person axioms or in person  deductions, den na person intuition nai gats go, nor be person theory.

In fact, wetin strike Conway as counterintuitive implication of de homesteading ethic, and den lead am to reject am, fit dey easily interpreted quite differently. E dey true, as Conway talk, say dis ethic go allow for de possibility of tde entire world to dey homesteaded. What about newcomers for dissituation wey own notin but dia physical bodies? The homesteaders nor fit restrict access to dia property for dese newcomers and dis nor go dey intolerable? I fail to see why. (Empirically, of course, de problem nor deyexist: if nor be  for governments restricting access to unowned land, dere for still be plenty of empty land around!) Dese newcomers normally come into existence somewhere as children born to parents wey be owners or renters of land (if dem come from Mars, and nobody want dem here, so what?;dem assume say risk dey come, and if dey now wan return, tough luck!). If de parents nor provide for de newcomers, dem dey free to search de world over for employers, sellers, or charitable contributors, and a society wey dey ruled by de homesteading ethic go be, as Conway put am, de most prosperous one possible! If dem still nor fit find *anybody* willing to employ, support, or trade wit dem, why not ask wetin dey wrong with *dem*, instead of Conway feeling sorry for dem? Apparently *dem* gats dey intolerably unpleasant fellows and nid shape up, or dem deserve no oda treatment. Such, in fact, go be my own intuitive reaction.
