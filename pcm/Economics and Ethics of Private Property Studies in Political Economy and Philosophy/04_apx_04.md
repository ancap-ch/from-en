### On the Indefensibility of Welfare Rights

[^0]: Reply to David Conway, “A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism”, *Austrian Economics Newsletter* (Winter/Spring, 1990).

David Conway  dey claim say my argument dey intend show de unrestricted validity for de homesteading principle matta. de first-use-first-own rule wey cocern onowned nature given resources dey flawed, and say e fit demonstrate de defend ontop welfare right matta. I still dey convinced say na him counterargument na him no correct

 Ontop that, i no get wahala wit him presentation abi argument, i go first sharp sharp table my proof. Second, i go point out de middle error wey dey him reply. Third, i dey wish say i go give explanation for Conway rejection wey concern my argument say na becus e get to do wit small common understanding wey concern  logic reasoning.

weda person get right or e no get, if e even dey, e fit only dey decide for place ontop argument. E no dey possible to take deny de truth for dis matta wey you no go jonze urself inside. To dey argue nid make person get betta control over dos small small resources. (one’s brain, vocal cords, etc.). to deny dis anoda time go even make de point dey clear well well.. Further, de person go don get ownership jeje becus say him begin use dis resources before anoda person don dey use am. If no be so, him no fit come talk again abi argue anything for de matta. So, anyone wey deny de validity wey concern homesteading principle matta at least go do with respect unto some resources wey go contradict de content wey get to do wit him proposition thru him own act for proposition making. So far, e appear say, Conway go agree. But him go put limit wey dey for de object range wey fit go legitimately dey homesteaded. Unfortunately inside Conway’s case, however, wen once dem don accept abi get full control  ontop some homesteaded e mean say e dey admitted as e dey justified, e don become or dey imposible to take justify any restrictions wey dey for homesteading process-except say na self-impose, or na de one you voluntary do—so make you for no run into contradictions. If say de proponent for dat kind restriction bin dey consistent, e for bin make sense as e for dey control some no be all, albeit linited, scare resources wey him no go de alowed to dey employ additional homesteading. yet, him no fit come interfere wit anoda extended homesteading jus becus say him lack means to try do anything about am. And if him come interfere, him need  (inconsistently) extend him ownership claim go beyond him own justly homesteaded resources. Moreover, in order make him justify him interference him go nid invoke principle of property acquisiton wey go dey compactible wit de homesteading principle: Him go nid claim (inconsistently) say person wey go extend him homesteading and person wey do so make e waka wit de principle say no one fit argue make e be generally invalid, dey, or at least fit be, an aggressor (even wen him dey do so no fit still talk say dis person take anything from person becus say him bin no do well come take something wey no be him own before before.*, i.e., things wey person for dat level don ever recognize say na scarce and wey no one for don take as him own if say him recognize dia scarcity before before. including anybodi wey be like conway, wey bin dey concern about de fate of late-comers dem, and e wan preserve dis resources make dem fit use am later.

 De error wey cause Conway’s rejection for dis argument na say him refuse to acknowledge de logical incompatibility for him idea inside welfare rights for de one hand—de notion wey say person fit get enforceable claims against homesteaders—and for de homesteading principle wey dey de other. Weda de first idea dey right or na de second dey right. However, we no fit talk say de first dey right because before anyone fit talk so, we suppose see de  second one as presuppose wey dey  valid. dat kind thing like right no dey for life, then, for Conway’s sense ontop right to get person life sustained by anoda people. E fit only be one person each wey get right to own him physical bodi, and everything wey be homesteaded wit him own help, make him fit engage mutually beneficial exchanges wit oda people dem. If to say, for instance, say i no dey well at all and de only way wey i fit take survive na to get my brain short-circuited wit Conways's. Him fit get de right to say him no nid am? I dey reason so, and I dey sure say him self dey think so. But him no fit get de right if e come go welfare ground (assuming say him life no go dey that threatened for dat kind operation), but na only  for basis wey dey homesteading principle wey say de precondition for person to dey exist lik wey dey reason only thing wey him dey think and person wey dey argue. Further, him claim wey be say welfare rights na “every bit as objective” like dos implied by mixing person labor wit scarce resources (onto to my thesis say dat de former dey subjective, arbitrary, verbal, derived and say him commot from thin air) dey fallacious. Through homesteading objective wey link between a *particular person* abi a *particular resource* dey created. But how for dis world wey person fit talk say my need fit give rise for claim wey regard a particular resource owner X, wey fit be Y, or Z, if i no bin get homesteade abi even produced ecen one?! Not only say e dey neediness incapable for objective identification or measurement: Wey go determines who dey ready and who no dey  needy? Everyone dey for himself? But wetin go happen if I no come agree with someone’s self-assessment? People don die fromlove-sickness. Abi dem get right to a lover-conscript? People don survived from to dey eat grass, bark, rats, roaches, even oda dirty things. abi needy peopel no dey again because say grass or dirty dey plenty to eat? If not, why not? For how long de support for tde needy go come last? Abi na forever? And wetin go happen to de rights of de supporters who go come turn slaves permanently give de needy? Or what if my support for de needy don caused make i become needy myself, or somehow e don increase my own future needs? abi i go still continue to dey support dem? And how much work i go come expect de poor to perform in return for de support wey i donsupport dem, de fact say here person no dey deal wit a mutually beneficial employment relation abi voluntary charity to carry start? As much say de needy feel dey appropriate?

Moreover, even if all these difficulties were overcome, more are lying in the wings because need does not connect the needy with any resource or resource owner in particular, yet it must invariably be particular resources that provide relief. The needy may be needy without any fault of their own, but the non-needy may be non-needy without any fault of theirs, too. So how can the needy claim support from me rather than from you? Surely that would be utterly unfair toward me in particular! In fact, either the needy can have a claim against no one in particular, which is to say they have no claim whatsoever; or else their claim would have to be directed equally against each one of the world’s non-needy.

Yet how can the needy possibly enforce such a claim? After all, they lack resources. For this to be possible, an all-resourceful, worldwide operating agency would be required. The owners of such an agency obviously would have to be classified as among the non-needy and could hence have no direct claim against anyone. Supposedly, only need creates such claims. In fact, this agency would have to be considered one of the foremost debtors to the needy, and it could only legitimately act against other non-needy if it had previously voluntarily paid *its* share of welfare debts *and* the needy had contractually entrusted it with such an enforcement task. Hence, the welfare problem would have to wait for a solution until this institution arrived. So far it has not arrived, and there is nothing to indicate that it will arrive in the near future. Even if it did, welfare rights would still be incompatible with the homesteading rule as an indisputably valid, axiomatic principle.

The explanation for Conway’s refusal to accept the homesteading ethic lies in a misconception regarding the nature of ethical theory. Instead of recognizing ethics as a logical theory, deductively derived from incontestable axioms (akin to praxeology), Conway implicitly shares a popular, empiricist-intuitionist (or gut-feeling) approach toward ethics. Accordingly, an ethical theory is *tested* against moral experience such that if the theory yields conclusions at variance with one’s moral intuitions, it should be regarded as falsified. However, this view is entirely mistaken and, much like in economics, the role of theory and experience in ethics is almost precisely the opposite: It is the very function of ethical theory to provide a rational justification for our moral intuitions, or to show why they have no such basis and make us reconsider and revise our intuitive reactions. This is not to say that intuitions can never play a role in the building of ethical theory. In fact, counterintuitive theoretical conclusions may well *indicate* a theoretical error. But if after one’s theoretical reexamination errors are found neither in one’s axioms nor in one’s deductions, then it is one’s intuitions that must go, not one’s theory.

In fact, what strikes Conway as a counterintuitive implication of the homesteading ethic, and then leads him to reject it, can easily be interpreted quite differently. It is true, as Conway says, that this ethic would allow for the possibility of the entire world’s being homesteaded. What about newcomers in this situation who own nothing but their physical bodies? Cannot the homesteaders restrict access to their property for these newcomers and would this not be intolerable? I fail to see why. (Empirically, of course, the problem does not exist: if it were not for governments restricting access to unowned land, there would still be plenty of empty land around!) These newcomers normally come into existence somewhere as children born to parents who are owners or renters of land (if they came from Mars, and no one wanted them here, so what?; they assumed a risk in coming, and if they now have to return, tough luck!). If the parents do not provide for the newcomers, they are free to search the world over for employers, sellers, or charitable contributors, and a society ruled by the homesteading ethic would be, as Conway admits, the most prosperous one possible! If they still could not find *anyone* willing to employ, support, or trade with them, why not ask what’s wrong with *them*, instead of Conway’s feeling sorry for them? Apparently *they* must be intolerably unpleasant fellows and should shape up, or they deserve no other treatment. Such, in fact, would be my own intuitive reaction.
