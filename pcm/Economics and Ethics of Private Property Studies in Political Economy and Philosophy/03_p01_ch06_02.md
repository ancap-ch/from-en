### From Commodity Money to Paper Money: De Devolution of Money

If money fit turn commodity money, how em fit becom paper money? Em do am thru de development of oda type of money (paper name to commodity money)¬¬- but thru mago mago and only at de price of economic failure.

For unda commodity money standard like for gold standard till em reach 1914, money “circulate” for one hand for de form of standard metal bars and gold coins for different value take dey buy and sell against one anoda for some kind fix percentage according to dia weight and d quantity of de metal. For anoda side, to dey reduce de cost to take dey store tins (safekeeping) and to dey deal wit how to clear money, wey dey de stage wey resemble de one dem take dey transfer de title of property- wey include stock and bond certificate- as method dem take dey fasten exchange wey involve *non* money goods for de world for de main time, as em dey side by side wit money normal and gold certificate- property titles (claims) to particula amount of gold dem put for particula bank- wey dem dey use take exchange. De way gold monie and oda form of money dey affect de total way dem supply money- for any certificate put am to dey circulate for de same amount wey gold be comot am de way em dey circulate (deposit)- wey nor be people income and dia how dia property spread. Yet no doubt say, de way money dey exist wit one anoda and oda form of money and de possibility to dey hold money for any of de form and de different combination of dat form con join comfortable wey em add to person wey dey participate for de market. Dis na how de inbuilt piece of paper wey no get value fit turn to wetin get power take buy stuff. If na dat extend dey show no condition to dey claim money and if na de extend as no doubt dey say dem still dey useful and recover for any time, dem dey buy dey sell paper ticket *as if* say na real money- dem dey trade am against de equal level. Once dem don gada purchasing power and con deny dem of dia nature as form of money (use one kind dey remove to recover dem), dem fit continue to dey work as money. As Mises put am:

> Before good dem take dey trade begin to dey serve as money em go don already get exchange-value base on some oda levels pass de function em dey serve as money. But money wey dey serve like dat still dey valuable even wen de original source em exchange-value don stop to dey exist.[^9]

After all, people wey like demself fit *wan* deny paper tickets of dia character as title to money? Dem fit *wan* suspend to recover con put inside worthless pieces of paper as monie? People wey dey support paper money like Milton Friedman say na so em be, and dem normally dey quote de motive to dey save as de reason for dia replacement of paper (controlled money) for commodity money: De standard for gold involve to dey waste tins wey dey required for de digging and minting of de gold. Dem suppose dey consider big effort put am to take produce money.[^10] wetin important na to use paper wey no too cost instead of gold, dat kind wastage go disappear, and dem go release effort to take dey produce direct important goods for producers and consumers. But na paper money (controlled money) big economic use wey dey explain de present reason why de people for de world abandon commodity monie. But na so? Say paper money dey dominate mean say na becos of to dey save well? Em fit reason am say fit be? Fit really be say people wey get interest for demself really *wan* save as people wey dey support paper money dey think?

Some kind deep investigation show say dis tin no possible, and say de body wey dey manage paper money need different reason- wey no dey harm but evil- agenda: Reason economy wey dey operate wit money wit (at least) one bank and money kor kor (“outside money” for diz era language) and oda form of money too (“inside monie”) wey dey circulate. If people wey get hand for market wan really save for de cost to dey use commodity money (wit de main goal to remove gold as money but to use paper), person go seea am first- like em near dia aim- dem go wan give uo to dey use outside money (gold). Dem go dey do everitin wit inside money (paper), and money wey dey outside dem go put am for bank and dem go kukuma comot am to dey circulate (If not, as far as say better money still dey go round, dos people wey dey use gold coin go do one kind tin wit how dem do tins- say dem *no* wan save for de cost wey follow de use.)

Howeva, em dey possible say oda type of money fit remove and replace genuine money as means of exchange? Even many people wey dey support paper money don dey agree say em possible. The reason be say oda forms of money be *substitutes* and em get one permanent and confirm disadvantage if you compare am to normal money. Dem fit collect paper notes (claims for money) for de level and extent wey dem pay de deposit fee to dat deposit body. To dey provide security and to clear service na expensive business, and deposit fee na de price, dem dey pay for money dem guide. If dem bring paper note to redeem something afta de date reach wey dem pay for de sageguarding fees by de original or former payer, de institution dem put de money dem go input collection card and dat kind note go con trade for discount against normal money. De disadvantage wey oda forms of money get be say dem must dey continually redeposit and re-give order to dey maintain dia character as money- to sell for de same level- and becos of dix nature dem dey only function as money for de main time and time being. Only proper money (gold coins) suppose dey permanent to dey function as means dem take dey exchange. Normally, aside say inside money dey eva displace outside money, dem suppose expect de issue of oda form of money to get less freedom- dem suppose only dey use am for big amount of money and for business concerning people wey dey sell everiday- but de big population go dey use money to dey buy most of their things, em go con dey show dia like for *nor* to dey save as Friedman reason am.[^11].

Afta all, even if person con reason am becos of argument say na only inside money dey circulate but dem store all de better money for bank, de wahala wey concern paper money no end for here. To dey sure, de way dem dey look de matter dey simple enough: All commodity money dey idle for bank. Em for no better if dem use all dis idle gold instead of say dem dey use am for chopping or produce tins- to treat teeth or jewelry- but dem con dey reason say de means dem take dey exchange con dey less costly- infact, for practice no cost- paper money? Nor be am.

First, to imagine to remove gold as money no mean say bank fit claim d whole money for supply, and de public go con keep de note. No person apart from person wey get bank to agree to dat am! Nobody wan *dat kind* savings. In fact, dis no go be savings at all but na way to extort de public and na only de bank dey gain. Nobody go like *wan* anoda person extort am. (Yet de extortion of person own commodity money thru governments and dia central banks na de only method wey be say commodity money don dey replaced by paper money.) Instead, each person wey dey deposit go wan retain de ownership of em deposits and collect em gold back.

Den, even so, one kunk problem con come up: No matter who- de bank or de public get de notes now, dem be like paper wey no fit recover. Before, de amount wey dey attach to dey produce dat kind paper no jux be one to take dey print paper tickets, but na importantly to dey attract doz wey dey deposit gold by to dey provide protection and to clear services.  Now, wit paper wey no fit recova notin dem fit dey guide again. The amount to take dey produce money con turn zero, to ordinary printing amount. Before, wey paper be like gold, de note don get power dey buy. But how de bank or public fit make people dey collect dem now? Dem fit use am buy and sell for goods wey no need money for de former normal percentage to exchange? Clear say no be so. As far as say no court case concerning to dey produce note ver dey; wey dey unda competition for free entry, if de (nonmoney) price dem pay for paper note pass de amount dem dem produce am, to de produce note go reach one big point wey de price of money go reach em amount to take produce am. De result na say tins go expensive. No person go collect paper money again, and movement enter *real value* go con enter. De economy wey involve money go crash totally and de society go con go back to de olden days, too much trade by barter method. As den comot for barter, new one go show (fit be gold) commodity money go come up (and dos wey dey produce note again, so make people accept dia note, go start use dem as money). See diz way to take dey save!

If person go succeed to try replace commodity money by paper money, den, em must fulfil added requirement: Em must stop free entry to enta de business to dey produce-note, and dem must establish money *monopoly*. One common person wey dey make paper money fit make tins cost anyhow and money karst. But as far as say, dem hold am wit law from em rival, monopolist fit by himself reduce how em go take dey produce em note and make sure say dem retain dia value of to take buy tins. Em go con reason de task of to dey *recover* em old note for de same level wit new de one, as dat one wey dey provide security and clearing service to dey accept note deposit con exchange am by to dey issue oda type of note- dey ask for deposit account and checkbook money- against charge for deposit.

Concerning diz mata, some kind question con come up. Before wit commodity money dem dey permit every persin to go dey dig gold and do coin business wit open mind- to dey follow de reason of people wey too like demself and people wey dey gada property. De difference, for Friedman “paper money gain” to happen, dem go need to comot competition con make monopoly stand. Even wit dat one dem fit make peace wit legit monopoly wit people wey too like demself? Em fit happen say people wey like make paper money stand fit still gree as dem dey normally gree for de dvision of work to dey use one and de same commodity take dey do exchange? If nor be so, em show show say de mount wey dey attach wit day kind monopoly dem go reason am big pass all de amount of de tins dem dey save?

To dey bring up dis kind question na to answer dem. Monopoly and to dey pursue personal-interest no dey align. To dey sure, reason why person fit wan become money monopolist dey exist. After all, no be to dey store, guide and recova precious commodity, de amound dem take dey make am go reduce well well and de monopolist go get extra gain. To dey protected by de law from future competition, dis profit from monopoly go turn “capitalized” (em go show permanently high money for em property), and on top em property money dem increase em suppose dey sure of normal rate of return thru interest. Even to talk say dat kind arrangement go benefit de monopolist no be to say em go favour anoda person, also em fit start naturally. In fact, no get reason for any person to dey like *any person dan himself* make em be de monopolist, and normally no agreement on how to dey select any particular monopolist go dey possible. De power of monopolist fit dey arrogant- dem force am against people wey no like monopolists. To define am, monopoly dey cause difference between two different people for different level: concerning dos- people dem allow to dey produce money and de small people- people wey, to de advantage of de fomer, dem no dey allow to do de same. Dem no fit support dat kind institution for de same freeway as de institution of de division of labor and commodity money. Em *no*, be as em be, de “natural” result of combine advantage to dey interact, but na one-sided advantage to thief. Normally, instead of to dey rely for em usual existence thru free support and cooperation, monopoly need to put fear of kasala.[^12]

Afta all, self-interest no align and monopoly no dey end once dem don create de monopoly but dey continue as far as say de monopoly dey work. Em no fit but dey work abnormally for de cost of nonmonopolists dem comot. First, for unda time wey free competition dey (free entry), every person wey dey produce always dey unda pressure to dey produce wetin em dey make for price dem reduce, if em *no* do like dat, em go carry risk say na new people go comot am who dey make dey product for small money. Against diz one, one single person wey dey control tins wey dem comot from de competition, no dey unda dat kind disturbance. In short, since de amount dem take dey do money include one person wey dey control tins own salary wey join em award wey money no involve, de monopolists “natural” choice na to *raise* em costs. From here, em suppose expect say de amount for one person to dey produce paper money go soon, if em no be from de beginning, *pass* dos wey concern commodity money wey eye too dey.

Moreova, em fit predict say de price of paper money unda monopoly go jejely increase and dia power to dey buy compare to money, and em quality go always dey go down. Dem dey free from new people, every person wey dey do monopoly dey eager to raise de price and reduce de quality. Even self dis one na true of people wey stingy to control money. Oda monopolist go need consida say price fit dey increase (maybe em quality decrease) becos of long demand for dia product wey fit lead to small gain, person wey dey control money go dey assured say de way dem dey demand for em product- de normal way dem take dey exchange- go too no high. Infact, wen tins no too high, wen de demand for money disappear, person wey get monopoly ova money go always dey reason say em gain as em dey sell de money go increase even as em dey raise de price of de money (reduce de way em dey buy tins). As em get de power to dey print money base on say em dey reason himself you go expect de monopoly bank to dey supply money well well, but as dem dey increase to dey supply paper money em no dey add anytin to property- de numba of people wey dey directly consume and produce goods for real- but hardly dey cause inflation (dey decrease amount wey you fit use money buy sometin), wit de new note wey dey circulate de monopolist fit increase *em* main income (con dey affect doz wey no be monopolist wey low dia own). Em fit print de note and em no go cost am money and em fit go dey buy *real* property (weda na consumer abi producer good) or use dem take pay back *real* debt. De main money of people wey no dey work for bank go reduce- dem go get small goods and more money to dey buy tins small small. Infact, de asset of de monopolist go increase- em get many good wey no concern money (em always dey get de amount of money em want). Who, for dis kind situation, apart from angels, *nor go* try find to expand how to supply money and em go make de currency dey go down.

Dem need instruction to take argue de theory of paper money as em put am for up according to how Milton Friedman see am, as de main present champion of paper money.

Wey em younga broda no give attention to de question of how money dey con be de senior Friedman con observe say, base on history, all de type of money first start as commodity money (and oda type of money as store to commodity money), and em no too sure of old Friedrich A. Hayek reason of rival paper money.[^13] Infact, em positive method misled am as em fail to know say money (and oda type of money) *nor fit* start for anoda way and so Hayek’s reason go fail.

Against wetin dem yarn for here, thruout em whole work Friedman always dey say commodity money go con “naturally” dey replaced by- better, resource wey dey save cost- paper money era. As em sweet reach, em no give em support for dis theory, em overlook all de problem for de theory, and any talk or evidence em dey give dey *contradict* em own claim. Em get, first, no show say Friedman dey aware of de problem to take replace outside money wit de one for inside. Even say outside money no fit comot to dey circulate, how, apart from to thief, wey dem fit serve de link wey dey between paper and commodity money? Becos dem dey always dey use outside money no mean say dem *nor* regard am as inferior money; and de fact say dem need deprive sometin nor to dey use commodity as money show say paper money *nor* be natural thing!

Make sense, afta dem don ovacome de problem to dey explain how dem suspend to reclaim tins dem fit reason am as natural or better, Friedman con confirm am say paper money no fit, for de reason dem talk am for up, come wit competition but need monopoly. From dia em con talk say “to dey produce paper money as if, em be, natural monopoly”.[^14] Even though, paper money need monopoly, em no gree say anytin dey “natural” for dat kind monopoly and Friedman no talk any argument concerning how monopoly fit become de natural result of talk between people wey get personal interest. Even so, Friedman wey young no even consida mago mago for olden days about market and dos wey no like monopoly: de talk say if you give persin power em go use am, dis con bring de talk say de small people wey dey produce no dey get better effect (as em concern cost and price even quality self). Even for de talk dem dey take am as childish for Friedman part first wey em dey support how government fit take establish money monopoly and con dey expect make dis monopolist dem *nor* use dia power, but to work for smallest amount wey possible and con increase money supply jeje (for around 3-5percent for a year). Dis go reason say, to dey be monopolist, one important change for de person self-interest go need happen.

To get em wide experience wit em own normal view of de world of pure paper money as em start to dey use am since 1971 and to dey look go back for em own normal argument of to dey save cost for paper money wey na small people dey control like forty years before, em no surprise me sha say de old man (Friedman) no gree say wetin em talk don turn lie.[^15] Since dem remove wetin remain for de gold commodity money standard, em realise wetin fit make price of tins increase well well for de whole world; de way dem take dey predict how price dey move don reduce; dem don remove long-period bond (like consols) for de market; de numba of people wey dey invest and adviser dem for “hard money” and de tins wey concer dos business don increase anyhow; de investment for money for gain and hope of de currency don develop and don contain too much amount of main tins wey fit- witout de way tins increase and how dem no fit predict am- no go fit dey exist at all or fit nor get de same value dem get nau; finally, em be like say de main amount of resource dem carry put to dey produce gold dem gada from people wey dey hold am take dey make tins dey cost don many.[^16] but wetin Friedman con conclude from em clear evidence? If person follow how em take dey believe wit good mind base on wich kind science wey dey predict and de one wey dey predict lie con spoil person own, person suppose reason say Friedman go dump em theory as wetin too dey wrong and mah em dey support to use commodity money.  Nor be so. Instead, as em dey show em ignorance (abi arrogance), em con carry talk say make dem no reason em evidence as “em dey beg to return to gold way. For de oda side me dey regard say to go back to dat gold era no make sense and nor fit happen”.[^17] Nau as em dey always talk say why em dey reason dos gold time “no dey reasonable, emotional”, and say na only paper money dey “technically okay”.[^18] As Friedman talk, wetin dem need do to conquer de wahala of de current paper money na to find

>some way to dey bring how dem go take dey know de price for long period, and oda way dem go take dey convat am to commodity or, maybe some device wey fit make to direct possible. Dem don suggest many anchor and device, from rule of how money dey grow to de table arrangement reach how to separate de way dem dey exchange from how dem dey rate de amount. As em be, dem neva gree for general way to take dey do am.[^19]

[^11]: Infact, right from history na so em dey be: Normally, dem no dey like use note befor, de way dem dey accept am- compare to oda type of good money like gold or silver too get limitation.

To take make people sabi oda type of money dey we need two tins wey dey work side by side: First be say, de company wey dey give note suppose over like note pass real money by to dey charge for nor deposit fee or even mah dey charge interest for deposits. Second be say, to dey guide money *nor* dey cheap and de money dem deposit *nor fit* give dem de interest back, de bank, make dem for cover dia konk loss, dem need to dey reserve small tin, dis one mean say, dem need issue con bring new ticket ma hem dey circulate, wey dem no fit know de difference wit oda note wit korokoro eye, wey dem no cover wit real money.

For correct sense and economic levels base on divided-reserve banking mah you see de part, “From Deposit and Loan Banking reach Fractional-Reserve Banking: How Credit Take Fall”, for down.

[^12]: Dem fit argue am say monopoly agreement go possible (reasonable), if person get doz monopoly bank- am distribute de gain reach-everybody. Nor be say everybody, den, nor jux be people wey dey do monopoly, gain from de save oda type of paper for gold?

In short, dat kind agreement na magic. If people put hand take get de monopoly bank mean say dem must give dem stock certificate dem fit sell. But na who go get soso amount of stock? Abi na bank customer base on dia deposit size? Even so people wey dey hold note dey save for gold and go want mah dem put dem like people wey get de bank base on how much money dem get. Wat of people wey get and dey sell goods wey no concern wit money? To dey show say dem fit collect paper instead of gold, dem, too, dey play dia part to save money. But how for dis world persin fit talk how many shares to take award *dem* wen be say wetin dem dey put join, as em be, different quantities of different consumer and producer goods? Final final, em go hard to reach agreement.

In fact, why go be say new persin for market- go later deposit, note or persin wey get goods wey no involve money wey *nor* know anytin concerning banking stock, as dem carry am give first people wey rich free of charge, even say em dey do find how to save money nau jux like dem dey dat time? Dat kind arrangement go follow one pattern to take share de gain and money mah favour doz wey first bring de idea wey fit make de oda people loss self. Even if dem give new bank stock for de new deposit, note or people wey dia own no involve money, dat kind stock no go get value from de start and de bank wey dey give am no go succeed.

To take join, as go explain am for down, no matter how dem solve de problem of who get am, de way de bank dey work-infact-*must*- affect how dem dey share people gain and der investment.

[^16]: People wey believe say money dey control tins don talk say, as dem no con dey use gold as money con dey use pure paper nau, de price for gold go fall- from de normal rate wey be $35 per ounce con reach around $6 and no bam. In fact, gold price don increase. For one time em reach $850 for one ounce, and most time em dey dey between $300 and $400\. As de time to dey write diz level de price na around $375.

Among de suggestions for anoda type of paper money “anchor” wey Friedman newly consida, de “rule for money dem seize” need small comment (look Friedman, “Money Policy for de 1980s” *To take Promote Progress*, John H. Moore, ed. [Stanford: Hoover Institution, 1984]). For one area dis book get advantage ova em early 3 to 5 percent rule concerning how money dey grow. Em support for latter rule dey based on de important mistake proto-Keynesian talk say money form part of de project for people, wey be say de economy no fit grow past 5 percent unless em dey allowed to do like dat by to dey increase de way dem supply money. Against diz tin, de rule for money dem seize show say dem recognize olden Hume belief wey say de supply of money dey equally highest or, as Friedman put am, say money “usefulness to de community as a whole no jux depend on de amount of money wey dey (Friedman, *Money Mischief*, p. 28). If not, wetin em talk no show advance at all, but how for dis world dem go allow monopolist to dey follow pattern of how to seize money pass strict 3 to 5 percent growth rule.

Even if dem solve dis problem like say na miracle, dis one no go change de attitude of de few wey dey control as format for one-side pilfering and gain and mah dem distribute property. Apart from say de monopolist dey offer deposit and clearing service (wey em customer go pay am money), em go need do de work, for customer and people wey no be customer, to take replace old, note wey tear-one-on-one free of charge-wit new, of de same type (infact, who go want replace permanent commodity money wit paper money wey fit tear?). Infact, wey be say de cost of dis mata fit small, nor mean say no be anytin. Normally, ma hem for avoid to loss and recova em money, de monopolist no fit jux but *increase* de value of de money- and so persin fit jux go back to de old orda of how money dey grow.
