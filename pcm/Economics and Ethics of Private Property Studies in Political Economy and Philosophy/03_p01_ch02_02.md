E no hard to show sey this conclusion them legit, if we consider the case of tax money wey everybody know.  Dem dey only acquire all dose kind assets and com keep am because say dem go fit buy oda assets wey get value for future. Dem no get dere own intrinsic use-value kaka (as e just be like fiat paper money), or all dose kind use-value nor dey significant if dem dey compare am to de exchange-value (as e just be like all dose gold standard for where money still get commodity value wey still small). Instead, de value wey dem attach give dem na because of de purchasing power wey dem go get for future. Yet if de value wey money get com be say e get other assets wey go dey valuable for future, de effects wey go come out if dem dey tax people money go come just dey clear immediately.  De one wey dey important pass, wey go still dey follow if you increase de marginal utility wey dey for leisure and to dey consume, all dose kain tax go dey increase de marginal utility wey all dose future assets get. To dey change all dis kain constellations wey dey for all dis incentives go com mean say e don change eself from actor wey e first be to plenty plenty attempts to tey get all dis assets fast fast, for short time wey dem tey dey produce. De only process wey dey inside production wey short pass systematically if you dey compare am with all dose ones wey dey get future assets indirectly, through de first way wey dem tey dey get money, na say dem dey get am thru exchanges wey dey direct. But once again, if we dey use barter well well, dat one mean say we dey fall come back to economic primitivism and barbarism. Na exactly because say if we dey produce because say we wan use am for barter purpose, dat one go com result to output wey dey low and say mankind com grow pass dis kind developmental stage and instad, e com dey go back to, and e com even increase de system wey e tey dey produce for exchange wey nor dey direct wey be say as e dey require long period wey dem tey dey wait, e go come dey give return wey big well well wey concern different assets wey dem drag enter cash nexus. Every way wey dem tey dey task person mean say na step wey dey go back wey dem use force for de process. E dey reduce output, e com still dey reduce de way wey dem tey dey share labour, and e com lead to make social and economic integration com dey reduce (wey e be say if dem note am, e nor go come be worldwide, if nor be say dem com dey use monetary exchange wey dey indirect).

If we wan go further, de general tendency wey dey if we com dey use exchange mechanism wey dey direct pass de one wey nor dey direct wey to dey seize money by force dey cause com still get consequences wey dey very important wey concern de methods wey dem tey dey get de money sef. Just as e still dey for assets wey nor concern money, de marginality wey concern money wey dem increase wey still follow leisure consumption com make am dey more attractive to tey get money for ways wey nor dey consume time. Instead of to dey get am as returns for efforts wey dey produce value, dat is wey dey de framework of exchanges wey dey mutually beneficial, taxation go come dey increase de incentive wey dem go use to tey get am fast fast and directly, wey we nor go pass thru roundabout methods wey go hard well well wey go either dey produce or wey dey contract. For one side, dis one go come mean say person go need to dey try well well to tey increase de money assets wey e get if e just hide am from people wey dey collect tax. For de oda side, one kain tendency wey be dey grow before go con come out wey go com enter de possession of money wey dem use force tey seize – either for form wey dey illegal like thief thief, or form wey be say dey legal if you dey participate for one kain game wey dem dey call politics.[^9]

As we don complete dis economic analysis wey dey general wey concern de effects of taxation, wey people wey dey write about economics nowadays choose say dem nor go talk about am kaka, make I com turn face wetin dem dey talk follow wetin be de effects wey taxation dey bring wey dey under de heading tax-incidence. Base on our analysis before, e go dey easy to tey catch accounts wey get complete mistake. Really say dat one go fall seriously inside error wey dey deal with wetin dey specifics if person nor dey bothered make e study de basics go hardly com as wetin be complete surprise.

De account wey be say dey standard wey concern de problem of tax-incidence wey be say dey show well well for excise or sales tax dey go like dis:[^10] Abysay dem com impose excise or sales tax. Who go com carry de load wey dis one go bring? Dem recognize am – and I nor get any intention to dey argue weda dis thing na true – say for one way, e nor fit get question wey consumers go take de brunt, and last last do. E nor get aw de specific consequences of all dose kain tax be, e go either be de case wey people wey dey consume am go pay big money for dat same goods and de way wey dem tey dey live go come dey low because of dis thing, or e go com be say de tax go come cause cost wey big well well for producers side and den na de consumers go come suffer am because de output wey  dem dey produce go com dey low. However, and na with dis kain thing we com gat disagree sharp sharp, and dem com dey argue am weda if dem force tax or if dem nor force tax, weda e dey harm consumers for de first way or de second na one empirical question wey dey open, and de answer dey depend on de elasticity of demand for all dose product wey dem dey tax. If de demand dey inelastically sufficient, den all dose producers go come shift de whole load give consumers for de price wey go high. If e dey highly elastic, den de producers go com swallow de tax for de way of say production cost go com dey high, and if some part of de demand curve dey inelastic and anoda one com be elastic (na dis one be de kain case wey always dey happen), den dem go com need to share de load, wey one part go dey for consumers side and de oda part go dey producers side.

Wetin dey wrong with dis kain argument? As dem put am for place wey dey different from all dose ones wey dem use for de before analysis, person no go fit fail to notice am say e dey talk say, on one kain level of discussion, wetin dem don already show say nor be true for level wey dey general: de talk wey be say taxes go fit or e nor go fit reduce de output wey dem dey produce; say e nor get connection wey dey between taxes and output wey dem dey produce; and dem go must consider am say e dey possible say tax go fit affect consumption especially while e nor go touch production. If we wan assume, as wetin de textbook talk for tax –incidence matter, say make dem shift tax go front either everything or small for inside put for customers na say taxes nor go affect production negatively. Because if e dey possible to shift any amount of tax give customers, dat amount go com represent tax wey “nor dey productive,” tax wey just dey only on top consumption.[^11]

Make we for fit dey reject all dose analysis wey all dis typical textbook dey talk person go fit easily go back to de discussion wey we don first get before wey com give us de conclusion wey talk say any tax wey dem put on top people wey be be say na time preference go fit constrain am e go must affect production for way wey nor good pass any kain negative consequences wey dey imply consumption. However, I go choose road wey dey different for dis argument make I for fit make dat same point wey dey essential and I go come fit show de kain talk wey be say e no get any kain amount of tax wey dem go fit shift put on top customers. If we com dey assume anoda tin, na say we go dey assume wetin nor go fit manifest.

The absurdity of the tax-forward-shifting doctrine becomes clear as soon as one tries to apply it to the case of a single actor who continuously acts in both roles—that of a producer and a consumer. For such a producer-consumer, the doctrine amounts to this proposition: If he is faced with an increase in the costs of attaining some future good—an increase, that is, that he himself perceives as a cost-increasing event—then he shifts these higher costs onto himself in such a way that he responds by attaching a correspondingly higher value to the good to be obtained, thereby restoring his old profit-margin, thus leaving his role as producer unchanged and unimpaired, and requiring restrictive adjustments exclusively in his role as a consumer. Or, formulated even more drastically, insofar as his value-productive efforts are concerned, a tax does not make any difference for an individual, because he just starts liking the to-be-produced good correspondingly more.

Plain reasoning reveals that what generates such absurdity is a fundamental conceptual confusion: The forward-shifting doctrine arises from not recognizing that in one’s analysis one must assume that demand is given—and that this must be assumed because it in fact is given at any point in time. Any analysis that loses track of this is flawed, for if one were to assume that demand had changed, then everything would be possible: production might increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. If I am a producer of tea and tea is taxed and if it is assumed that the demand schedule for tea rises concurrently, then, naturally, it is possible that people are now willing to pay a higher price for tea than previously. Yet this is obviously not a forward shifting of the tax but the result of a change in demand. To present this possibility under the heading of tax-incidence analysis is plain nonsense: it is in fact an analysis of the entirely different question of how prices are affected by changes in demand and has nothing whatsoever to do with the effects of taxation. The confusion here is on as grand a scale as that which one would encounter if someone were to “refute” the statement that one apple and another make two by saying “No, I have just added another apple, and look, there are not two but three apples here”. It is hard to get away with such nonsense in math; in economics a doctrine hardly less absurd is the orthodoxy.

Yet if one is logically committed to assuming demand to be given whenever one tries to answer the question whether or not a tax can be shifted forward, every tax must be interpreted as an event that exclusively affects the supply side: it reduces the supplies at the disposal of suppliers.[^12] Any other conclusion would amount to a denial of what had been assumed from the outset—that a tax had indeed been imposed and perceived as such by producers. To say that only the supply curve is shifted whenever a tax is extracted (while the demand curve remains the same as before) is to say nothing else than that the entire tax-burden must in fact be absorbed by the suppliers. To be sure, the leftward shift of the supply curve would cause prices to rise and consumers would naturally be harmed by having to pay these higher prices and by only being able to afford a smaller amount of goods at such a price.[^13] Yet that consumers will invariably be hurt by taxes has of course never been doubted as one should recall. However, it is a misconception to think that this higher price is a shifting of the tax burden from producers to consumers. Rather, consumers are hurt here “only” by harm being done to producers who, despite higher prices charged for their supplies, must bear the brunt.[^14] One must ask oneself why, if an entrepreneur could indeed shift any amount of the tax-burden away from himself and onto consumers, he would not have already done so by voluntarily imposing a tax on himself instead of waiting for the actual coercive tax to come along! The answer is clear: At all times he is constrained in his price-setting activity by the actual given demand. The price set by any entrepreneur is set with the expectation that a price higher than the one actually chosen would yield a lower total revenue. Otherwise, if he expected a higher price to bring about a larger revenue he would raise it. As long as an entrepreneur expects the demand to be inelastic within the region of any price-range under consideration, he will take advantage of this and choose the higher price. He stops raising prices and settles for a specific one because his expectations are reversed and he anticipates the demand curve above this price to be elastic. These expectations regarding inelastic and elastic portions of the demand curve are not at all changed if the entrepreneur is faced with a tax. Then as now he expects higher prices to produce revenue losses. Thus, it is obviously out of the question to argue that he could escape the burden of the tax. In fact, if as a consequence of the reduced supply the price now rises, this upward movement must be into an elastic portion of the demand curve, and the entrepreneur thus must assumedly pay the full price of it in the form of reduced revenue. Any other conclusion is logically flawed. Only if the entrepreneur expects a change in demand occurring simultaneously with taxation could he change his price without thereby incurring losses. If he expects demand to have increased, for instance, such that there will now be an inelastic rather than an elastic stretch of the demand curve above the presently going price, he will be able to raise it without punishment. Again, this is not a forward shifting of the tax. This is increased demand. With or without the tax the entrepreneur would have acted in precisely the same way. The tax has nothing to do with such price changes. In any case, the tax must be paid exclusively and in full by the suppliers of the taxed goods.[^15]

[^9]: Here once again what has already been explained in a somewhat different connection in note 7 above becomes evident: why it is a fundamental mistake to think that taxation might have a “neutral” effect on production such that any “negative” effects on tax*payers* may be compensated by corresponding “positive” effects on tax *spenders*. What is overlooked in this sort of reasoning is that the introduction of taxation not only implies favoring nonproducers at the expense of producers. It simultaneously changes, for producers and nonproducers alike, the cost attached to different methods of attaining an income, for it is then relatively less costly to attain an additional income through nonproductive means, i.e., not through actually producing more goods but by participating in the process of noncontractual acquisitions of already produced goods. If such a different incentive structure is applied to a given population, then the length of the production structure will necessarily be shortened, and a decrease in the output of goods produced must result.

[^12]: Baumol and Blinder, *Economics: Principles and Policy*, p. 636, present the *demand* curve as changing in response to a tax.

[^13]: To avoid any misunderstanding then: Insofar as the textbook analyses of tax-incidence point out this fact they are of course entirely correct. It is the interpretation of this phenomenon they give which is fundamentally confused!

[^14]: See on this point also Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*, p. 809.

[^15]: Should a tax not immediately affect supply at all, as can happen in the short run, then it follows from the above analysis that the price charged will not change at all. For to raise it in response to the tax would once again imply pushing it into an elastic region of the demand curve. In the long run the supply will have to be relatively reduced and prices must move into this region. In any case, no forward shifting takes place. See on this also Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*, pp. 807ff.; idem, *Power and Market*, pp. 88ff.
