So far e don dey demonstrated say de right of original appropriation, wey mean to dey claim something for personal use, through actions dey compatible with and involved for de nonaggression principle as de logic to dey believe say something na true without any proof for argument. Indirectly, of course, e don also dey demonstrated say any rule wey dey specify different right nor go fit dey justified. Before e dey enter more detailed analysis, though, of *why* e be say any alternative ethic, wey mean good correct behaviour na wetin dem nor fit defend, one discussion wey go throw some additional light on de importance of some of de stipulations of de libertarian theory of property, some few remarks about wetin be and wetin nor be involve by to dey classify the latter norms to dey justified dey for order.

To dey make dis argument, one nor go need to derive one  “ought” from one  “is”. In fact one go fit readily subscribe to de view wey dem don almost generally accept say de gulf between “ought” and “is” dey logically unbridgeable.[^26]  Rather to dey classify de rulings of de libertarian theory of property I dis way na purely cognitive matter. e no longer follow from de classification of de libertarian ethics as “fair” or “just” say one ought to act accoprding to am than e follow de concept of validity or truth say one go dey always strive for am. To talk say e dey just also nor preclude de possibility of people to dey propose or even dey enforce rules wey nor dey compatible with dis principles. As a matter of fact, de situation with respect to norm dey very similar to that for other discipline of scientific inquiry. De fact, for instance, say certain empirical statements dey justified or justifiable and others nor dey nor imply say everybody only defend objective valid statements. On de contrary, people fit dey wrong, even intentionally. But de distinction between objective and subjective, between true and false nor dey lose any of e importance because of dis. Instead, people who go do so go need to dey classified as either uninformed  or dey lie intentionally. De case dey similar with respect to norms. Of course, people dey, many of dem, who nor dey propagate or enforce norms wey fit dey classified as valid according to de meaning of justification wey I don give before. Anyhow as e be, de distinction between justifiable and nonjustifiable norms nor dey dissolve because of dis, just as say between objective and subjective statement nor dey crumble because of de existence of uninformed or people wey dey lie. Rather, and accordingly, those people wey go propagate and kon force such different, invalid norms go again need to dey classified as uninformed or dishonest, insofar as one don make am clear to dem say their alternative norm proposal or enforcement nor go fit dey and  never go fit dey justifiable for argumentation. There go be even more justification for to dey do so  for moral case than for de empirical one, since de validity of de nonaggression principle and that of de principle of original appropriation through action as e logically necessary corollary must dey consider to be even more basic than any kind of valid or true statements. For wetin dey valid or true go dey defined as dat wey everyone – wey dey act according to de principles  - go possibly agree. As I just show, as least de implicit acceptance of dis rules na de necessary prerequisite to dey able to dey alive and argue at all.

[^26]: For de problem to dey derive “ought” from “is” see W.D. Hudson, ed., *The Is-Ought Question* (London: Macmillan 1969).

Why then e kon be say other nonlibertarian property theories fail to dey justifiable? First, e go dey noted, as e go clear shortly say all de practiced alternatives to libertarianism and most of de theoretically proposed nonlibertarian ethics nor go even pass de first formal universalization test and nor go fail for dis fact alone! All dis versions contain norms wey dey within their framework of rules wey dey legal wey get de form, “some people get, some people nor get”. Anyhow as e be, such rules wey specify different rights or obligations for different class of people nor get chance to dey accepted as fair by every potential participant for one argument for simply official reasons. Unless de distinction wey dey between de different classes of people happens to be say e dey acceptable to both sides as a e dey ground for de way things be, such rules nor go dey acceptable because dem go imply say one group na legal privileges wey dem award at de expense of complimentary discrimination against another group. Some people, either those who dey allowed to do something or those who nor dey allowed, nor go dey able to agree say dis na fair rules.[^27] Since most of de alternative proposals, as practiced or preached, need to rely on de enforcement of de rules such as “some people get de obligations to pay tax,and others get de right to consume dem”, or  “some people know wetin good for you and kon dey allowed to help you get dis allege blessings even if you nor want dembut you nor dey allowed to know wetin good for dem and help dem accordingly”, or some people get de right to determine who get too much of something and who get small, and others get de obligations to accept say”, or even more plainly, “de computer industry go must pay to subsidised de farmers, de employed for those wey dey unemployed, de ones without children to those with children”,, or vice versa. All of dem fit dey discarded as serious contenders  to de claim say one valid theory of norm, qua property norm because all dey indicate say by their formulation dem nor dey universalisable.

[^27]: See Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty*, p. 45.

Wetin dey wrong with one nonlibertarian ethic if dis dey resolved and indeed  one theory wey dem formulate say e contain exclusively universalizable norms of de type “nobody dey allowed to” or “ everybody go fit?” even then, de validity of that kind proposals never go hope say e go dey proven – not because of official reasons but because of their material specifications. Indeed, while de alternatives wey go fit dey refyted easily as regard to their claim to moral validity for simple official ground go at least dey practiced, de application of those versions wey dey sophisticated wey go pass de universalization test go prove for material reason to dey fatal: even if one try to, dem simply fit never dey implemented.

Two related specifications dey for de libertarian property theory with at least one which any alternative theory come into quarrel. According to de libertarian ethics, de first specification na dat aggression dey defined as one invasion of de *physical* integration of other people property.[^28] popular attempts dey to define am as one invasion of de *value* or *psychic integrity* of other people property. Conservatism, for instance, dey aim to dey preserve one given distribution of wealth and values and kon attempt to bring those forces wey fit change de status quo under control by means of price control, regulation, and behavioral control. As e clear, in order to do so,  property right of de value of things must dey assumed to dey justifiable, and one invasion of values, *mutatis mutandis*,  go dey to be classified as unjustifiable aggressions. Nor be only conservatism  dey use dis idea of propert y and aggression; redistributive socialism dey use am too. Property right to value must dey assumed to dey legitimate  when redistributive socialism allow me, for instance, to demand compensation from people wey be say their chances and opportunities affect my own. De same na true when compensation for committing  psychological, or “structural violence” dey requested. [^29] In order to dey able to ask for such  compensation,  wetin person  go must don do, namely dey affect opportunities, my psychic integrity, or my feeling of wetin dey owed to me, go dey classified as one aggressive act.

[^28]: On de importance of de definition of aggression as physical aggression also see Rothbard, ibid., chaps. 8–9; idem”, Law, Property Rights and Air Pollution”, *Cato Journal* (Spring, 1982).

[^29]: On de idea of structural violence as e different from physical violence see Dieter Senghass, ed., *Imperialismus und strukturelle Gewalt* (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1972). De idea to dey define aggression as one invasion of property *values* also dey underline both de theory of justice of John Rawls and Robert Nozick, anyhow different dis two author fit kon appear to be to many commentators. For how Rawl go think of his so-called difference-principle (“Social and economic inequalities go dey arranged so dat dem go reasonably expect am to be for everyone – including de ones wey get de smallest advantage – advantage or benefit”. John Rawls *A Theory of Justice* [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press 1971], pp. 60 – 83, 75ff.) as justified unless he simply believe say by to dey increase his relative wealth one person wey dey more fortunate commit aggression, and one wey dey less  fortunate then get one valid claim against de one wey dey more fortunate only because de relative position of de former one in terms of value don spoil?! And how Robert Nozick go claim am to dey justified for a “dominant protection agency” to outlaw competitors regardless of wetin their actions go be like? (Robert Nozick, *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* [New York: Basic Books, 1974], pp. 55f.) Or how he go believe am to be morally correct to outlaw so-called nonproductive exchanges, that is, exchange where one party go dey better off if de other one nor dey exist at all or at least get nothing to do with am (as, for instance, in de case of blackmailee and one blackmailer), regardless of whether or not such exchange involve physical invasion of any kind (ibid., pp. 83–86) unless he think say de right to get de integrity of  value of person property (rather than e physical integrity) preserved don exist? For one devastating critique of Nozick theory in particular see Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty*, chap. 29; for de fallacious use of indifference curve analysis, employed by both Rawls and Nozick, idem, *Towards a Reconstruction of Utility and Economics* (New York: Centre for Libertarian Studies, Occassional Papers Series, No. 3, 1977).

Why dis idea of to dey protect de value of property dey unjustifiable? First, while person, at least for  principle, go fit get full control over whether or not e actions cause de *physical* characteristics of something to change and hence go fit also get full control over whether or not those actions dey justifiable, control over whether or not person action affect de *value* of somebody else property nor dey rest with de person wey dey act but rather with other people and their subjective evaluations. So, no one go fit determine *ex ante* if e actions go dey qualified as justifiable or unjustifiable. One go first have to interrogate de whole population to make sure say actions wey person don plan nor go change another person evaluation regarding e own property. Even then,  nobody go fit act until dem reach universal agreement on who do wetin with wetin, and at which point in time. As e clear, because of all de practical problems wey dey involved, everyone for don die tey tey and nobody go fit argue any longer, well before dem go reach agreement.[^30] Even more to deceive, dis position regarding property and aggression nor go fit even dey *argued* effectively because to dey argue in favour of any norm implies say conflict go dey over de use of some scarce resources; otherwise, there go simply be no need for discussion. As e be, in order to dey argue say way dey out of such conflict e must be presupposed say actions must dey allowed *before* to any actual agreement or disagreement because if dem nor dey allowed, one go fit nor even argue so. Yet if one go fit do this, and in-as-far as e exist as one intellectual position wey dem argue de position under scrutiny must assume say one go fit, then dis dey only possible because of de existence of *objective* borders of property – borders wey anybody go fit recognize on e own without nor getting to agree first with anybody else with respect to e system of values and evaluations. Such value-protecting ethic,too, in spite of wetin e talk, must in fact presuppose de existence of objective property borders rather than of borders wey dey determined by subjective evaluations, if only in order to get any surviving person who go fit make e moral proposals.

[^30]: See also Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty*, p. 46.

De idea of to dey protect value instead  of physical integrity dey also fail for one second related reason. As e dey evident, person value, for example for de labour or marriage market, go fit and indeed dey affected by other people physical integrity or degree of physical integrity. So, if person want property values to dey protected, one go need to allow physical aggression against people. As e be, na only because of de very fact say person borders – that is de border of person property for e own body as e domain of exclusive control say another person nor dey allowed to cross unless he wish to become one aggressor – na *physical* borders (intersubjectively ascertainable, and not just subjectively fancied borders) say everyone fit agree on anything independently (and agreement means agreement among independent decision-making units!). Only because de borders of property wey dem protect dey objective (that is, fixed and recognizable as fixed before to any convectional agreement) na there dem go fit be argumentation and possibly of and between independent decision-making units.  No body go fit argue in favour of one property system wey define borders of property in subjective, evaluative terms because simply to dey able to say so  presupposes say, contrary to wetin theory talk, one must in fact be one physically independent unit wey day talk am. 

De situation nor dey less dire for alternative ethical proposals when one turn to de second important specification of de rulings of de libertarian theory of property.  De basic norm of libertarianism dey characterized not only by de fact say property and aggression dey defined for physical term; e nor dey less important say e dey defined as private, individualized property and dat de meaning of de original appropriation, wey evidently dey implies to dey make one distinction for to dey decide between property claims wey get conflict., dem propose norms which for effect state say priority dey irrelevant for to dey make such decision and dat late-comers get as much of one right to ownership as first-comers. As e clear, dis idea dey involved when redistributive socialism dey make de natural owners of wealth and/or their heirs pay one tax so dat de unfortunate late-comers go fit participate for e consumption. E also dey involve when de owner of one natural resource dey forced to reduce (or increase) e present exploitation for de interest of posterity. Both times e only make sense to do wetin one person do when e dey assumed say de person wey dey accumulate wealth first,  or dey use de natural resource first, don thereby commit one aggression against some late-comers. If dem do nothing wrong, then de late-comers go get no such claim against dem.[^31]

[^31]: For one awkward philosophy attempt to justify one late-comer ethic see James P. Sterba, *The Demands of Justice* (Notre Dame, Ind.: Notre Dame University Press,1980), esp. pp. 58ff., 137ff.; for de absurdity of such ethic see Rothbard,*Man, Economy, and State*, p.427.

Wetin dey wrong with dis idea of to dey drop de prior-later distinction as morally irrelevant? First, if de late-comers (those wey nor do something with some scarce goods) indeed get as much of one right to dem as de first comers (those wey do something with scarce goods), then nobody go ever dey allowed to do anything with anything, as one go have to get all de late-comers consent before e go do wetin one wan do. Indeed, as posterity go include person childrens’ children – people who come so late say one nor go fit possibly ask dem – to advocate  one legal system wey nor dey make use of de prior-later distinction as part of of e own underlying property theory dey simply absurd because e implies to dey advocate death but must presuppose life to advocate anything. Not we, or our forefathers, or our progeny go fit, do, or go survive and say or argue anything if one follow dis rule. In order for any person – past, present or future – to argue anything e must be possible to survive now. Nobody go fit wait and suspend  to dey act until everyone of one indeterminate class of late-comers happens to come around and agree to wetin one wan do. Rather, in-as-far as one person find himself alone, he must dey able to act, to use, to produce, and to consume goods straightaway, prior to any agreement with people who simply nor dey around (and perhaps go never be).  In-as-far as person find himself for de company of others and conflict dey over how to use one given scarce resource, he must dey able to resolve de problem at one definite point in time with one definite number of people instead of to dey wait unspecified number of periods of time for unspecified numbers of people. Simply in order to survive, then, which be one prerequisite to dey argue in favour or against anything, property rights nor go fit dey conceived of as being timeless and nonspecific regarding de number of people wey dey concerned. Rather, dem must dey think dem as originating through to dey act at definite points in time for definite people wey dey act.[^32]

[^32]: Make e dey noted for here say only if property rights dey conceptualised as private property rights dey originate in time do am then become possible to make contracts. As e clear enough, contracts na agreements between enumerable physically independent units wey dey based for de mutual recognition of each contractor’s private ownership claim to things wey dem don acquire before for time to de agreement and which then concern de transfer of property titles to definite things from one definite prior to one definite later owner. No such thing as contract go fit conceivably dey exist for de framework of one late-comer ethic!

Furthermore, de idea of to dey abandon de prior-later distinction go simply dey incompatible with de nonaggression principle as de practical foundation of argumentation. To argue and possibly agree with somebody (if only for de fact say disagreement dey) mean to recognise de prior right of exclusive control over person own body. Otherwise, e go dey impossible for anybody to talk anything for one definite point in time and for somebody else to dey able to reply, for nor be  de first or de second speaker go be one physically independent decision-making unit anymore at any time. To dey eliminate de prior-later distinction, then, dey tantamount to dey eliminate de possibility of to dey argue and to dey reach agreement. Anyhow as e be, as person nor go fit argue say possibility nor dey for discussion without de prior control of every person over e own body wey dey recognised and dey accept am as fair, one late-comer ethic wey nor make dis distinction nor go never dey agree for by anybody. As e simple, to dey talk say e fit be go imply one contradiction, for person to dey able to say so go presuppose person existence for one independent decision-making unit at one definite point in time. 

So, person dey forced to conclude say de libertarian ethic nor only go fit dey justified and justified by means of one priori reasoning, but say no alternative ethic go fit dey defended argumentatively.
