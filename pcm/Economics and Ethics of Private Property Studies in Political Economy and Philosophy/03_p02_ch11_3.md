So far e don dey demonstrated say de right of original appropriation, wey mean to dey claim something for personal use, through actions dey compatible with and involved for de nonaggression principle as de logic to dey believe say something na true without any proof for argument. Indirectly, of course, e don also dey demonstrated say any rule wey dey specify different right nor go fit dey justified. Before e dey enter more detailed analysis, though, of *why* e be say any alternative ethic, wey mean good correct behaviour na wetin dem nor fit defend, one discussion wey go throw some additional light on de importance of some of de stipulations of de libertarian theory of property, some few remarks about wetin be and wetin nor be involve by to dey classify the latter norms to dey justified dey for order.

To dey make dis argument, one nor go need to derive one  “ought” from one  “is”. In fact one go fit readily subscribe to de view wey dem don almost generally accept say de gulf between “ought” and “is” dey logically unbridgeable.[^26]  Rather to dey classify de rulings of de libertarian theory of property I dis way na purely cognitive matter. e no longer follow from de classification of de libertarian ethics as “fair” or “just” say one ought to act accoprding to am than e follow de concept of validity or truth say one go dey always strive for am. To talk say e dey just also nor preclude de possibility of people to dey propose or even dey enforce rules wey nor dey compatible with dis principles. As a matter of fact, de situation with respect to norm dey very similar to that for other discipline of scientific inquiry. De fact, for instance, say certain empirical statements dey justified or justifiable and others nor dey nor imply say everybody only defend objective valid statements. On de contrary, people fit dey wrong, even intentionally. But de distinction between objective and subjective, between true and false nor dey lose any of e importance because of dis. Instead, people who go do so go need to dey classified as either uninformed  or dey lie intentionally. De case dey similar with respect to norms. Of course, people dey, many of dem, who nor dey propagate or enforce norms wey fit dey classified as valid according to de meaning of justification wey I don give before. Anyhow as e be, de distinction between justifiable and nonjustifiable norms nor dey dissolve because of dis, just as say between objective and subjective statement nor dey crumble because of de existence of uninformed or people wey dey lie. Rather, and accordingly, those people wey go propagate and kon force such different, invalid norms go again need to dey classified as uninformed or dishonest, insofar as one don make am clear to dem say their alternative norm proposal or enforcement nor go fit dey and  never go fit dey justifiable for argumentation. There go be even more justification for to dey do so  for moral case than for de empirical one, since de validity of de nonaggression principle and that of de principle of original appropriation through action as e logically necessary corollary must dey consider to be even more basic than any kind of valid or true statements. For wetin dey valid or true go dey defined as dat wey everyone – wey dey act according to de principles  - go possibly agree. As I just show, as least de implicit acceptance of dis rules na de necessary prerequisite to dey able to dey alive and argue at all.

[^26]: For de problem to dey derive “ought” from “is” see W.D. Hudson, ed., *The Is-Ought Question* (London: Macmillan 1969).

Why then e kon be say other nonlibertarian property theories fail to dey justifiable? First, e go dey noted, as e go clear shortly say all de practiced alternatives to libertarianism and most of de theoretically proposed nonlibertarian ethics nor go even pass de first formal universalization test and nor go fail for dis fact alone! All dis versions contain norms wey dey within their framework of rules wey dey legal wey get de form, “some people get, some people nor get.” Anyhow as e be, such rules wey specify different rights or obligations for different class of people nor get chance to dey accepted as fair by every potential participant for one argument for simply official reasons. Unless de distinction wey dey between de different classes of people happens to be say e dey acceptable to both sides as a e dey ground for de way things be, such rules nor go dey acceptable because dem go imply say one group na legal privileges wey dem award at de expense of complimentary discrimination against another group. Some people, either those who dey allowed to do something or those who nor dey allowed, nor go dey able to agree say dis na fair rules.[^27] Since most of de alternative proposals, as practiced or preached, need to rely on de enforcement of de rules such as “some people get de obligations to pay tax,and others get de right to consume dem,” or  “some people know wetin good for you and kon dey allowed to help you get dis allege blessings even if you nor want dembut you nor dey allowed to know wetin good for dem and help dem accordingly,” or some people get de right to determine who get too much of something and who get small, and others get de obligations to accept say,” or even more plainly, “de computer industry go must pay to subsidised de farmers, de employed for those wey dey unemployed, de ones without children to those with children,,” or vice versa. All of dem fit dey discarded as serious contenders  to de claim say one valid theory of norm, qua property norm because all dey indicate say by their formulation dem nor dey universalisable.

[^27]: See Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty*, p. 45.

Wetin dey wrong with one nonlibertarian ethic if dis dey resolved and indeed  one theory wey dem formulate say e contain exclusively universalizable norms of de type “nobody dey allowed to” or “ everybody go fit?” even then, de validity of that kind proposals never go hope say e go dey proven – not because of official reasons but because of their material specifications. Indeed, while de alternatives wey go fit dey refyted easily as regard to their claim to moral validity for simple official ground go at least dey practiced, de application of those versions wey dey sophisticated wey go pass de universalization test go prove for material reason to dey fatal: even if one try to, dem simply fit never dey implemented.

Two related specifications dey for de libertarian property theory with at least one which any alternative theory come into quarrel. According to de libertarian ethics, de first specification na dat aggression dey defined as one invasion of de *physical* integration of other people property.[^28] popular attempts dey to define am as one invasion of de *value* or *psychic integrity* of other people property. Conservatism, for instance, dey aim to dey preserve one given distribution of wealth and values and kon attempt to bring those forces wey fit change de status quo under control by means of price control, regulation, and behavioral control. As e clear, in order to do so,  property right of de value of things must dey assumed to dey justifiable, and one invasion of values, *mutatis mutandis*,  go dey to be classified as unjustifiable aggressions. Nor be only conservatism  dey use dis idea of propert y and aggression; redistributive socialism dey use am too. Property right to value must dey assumed to dey legitimate  when redistributive socialism allow me, for instance, to demand compensation from people wey be say their chances and opportunities affect my own. De same na true when compensation for committing  psychological, or “structural violence” dey requested. [^29] In order to dey able to ask for such  compensation,  wetin person  go must don do, namely dey affect opportunities, my psychic integrity, or my feeling of wetin dey owed to me, go dey classified as one aggressive act.

[^28]: On de importance of de definition of aggression as physical aggression also see Rothbard, ibid., chaps. 8–9; idem,” Law, Property Rights and Air Pollution,” *Cato Journal* (Spring, 1982).

[^29]: On de idea of structural violence as e different from physical violence see Dieter Senghass, ed., *Imperialismus und strukturelle Gewalt* (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1972). De idea to dey define aggression as one invasion of property *values* also dey underline both de theory of justice of John Rawls and Robert Nozick, anyhow different dis two author fit kon appear to be to many commentators. For how Rawl go think of his so-called difference-principle (“Social and economic inequalities go dey arranged so dat dem go reasonably expect am to be for everyone – including de ones wey get de smallest advantage – advantage or benefit.” John Rawls *A Theory of Justice* [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press 1971], pp. 60 – 83, 75ff.) as justified unless he simply believe say by to dey increase his relative wealth one person wey dey more fortunate commit aggression, and one wey dey less  fortunate then get one valid claim against de one wey dey more fortunate only because de relative position of de former one in terms of value don spoil?! And how Robert Nozick go claim am to dey justified for a “dominant protection agency” to outlaw competitors regardless of wetin their actions go be like? (Robert Nozick, *Anarchy, State, and Utopia* [New York: Basic Books, 1974], pp. 55f.) Or how he go believe am to be morally correct to outlaw so-called nonproductive exchanges, that is, exchange where one party go dey better off if de other one nor dey exist at all or at least get nothing to do with am (as, for instance, in de case of blackmailee and one blackmailer), regardless of whether or not such exchange involve physical invasion of any kind (ibid., pp. 83–86) unless he think say de right to get de integrity of  value of person property (rather than e physical integrity) preserved don exist? For one devastating critique of Nozick theory in particular see Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty*, chap. 29; for de fallacious use of indifference curve analysis, employed by both Rawls and Nozick, idem, *Towards a Reconstruction of Utility and Economics* (New York: Centre for Libertarian Studies, Occassional Papers Series, No. 3, 1977).

Why dis idea of to dey protect de value of property dey unjustifiable? First, while person, at least for  principle, go fit get full control over whether or not e actions cause de *physical* characteristics of something to change and hence go fit also get full control over whether or not those actions dey justifiable, control over whether or not person action affect de *value* of somebody else property nor dey rest with de person wey dey act but rather with other people and their subjective evaluations. So, no one go fit determine *ex ante* if e actions go dey qualified as justifiable or unjustifiable. One go first have to interrogate de whole population to make sure say actions wey person don plan nor go change another person evaluation regarding e own property. Even then,  nobody go fit act until dem reach universal agreement on who do wetin with wetin, and at which point in time. As e clear, because of all de practical problems wey dey involved, everyone for don die tey tey and nobody go fit argue any longer, well before dem go reach agreement.[^30] Even more to deceive, dis position regarding property and aggression nor go fit even dey *argued* effectively because to dey argue in favour of any norm implies say conflict go dey over de use of some scarce resources; otherwise, there go simply be no need for discussion. As e be, in order to dey argue say way dey out of such conflict e must be presupposed say actions must dey allowed *before* to any actual agreement or disagreement because if dem nor dey allowed, one go fit nor even argue so. Yet if one go fit do this, and in-as-far as e exist as one intellectual position wey dem argue de position under scrutiny must assume say one go fit, then dis dey only possible because of de existence of *objective* borders of property – borders wey anybody go fit recognize on e own without nor getting to agree first with anybody else with respect to e system of values and evaluations. Such value-protecting ethic,too, in spite of wetin e talk, must in fact presuppose de existence of objective property borders rather than of borders wey dey determined by subjective evaluations, if only in order to get any surviving person who go fit make e moral proposals.

[^30]: See also Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty*, p. 46.

De idea of to dey protect value instead  of physical integrity dey also fail for one second related reason. As e dey evident, person value, for example for de labour or marriage market, go fit and indeed dey affected by other people physical integrity or degree of physical integrity. So, if person want property values to dey protected, one go need to allow physical aggression against people. However, it is only because of the very fact that a person’s borders—that is the borders of a person’s property in his own body as his domain of exclusive control that another person is not allowed to cross unless he wishes to become an aggressor—are *physical* borders (intersubjectively ascertainable, and not just subjectively fancied borders) that everyone can agree on anything independently (and agreement means agreement among independent decision-making units!). Only because the protected borders of property are objective (i.e., fixed and recognizable as fixed prior to any conventional agreement), can there be argumentation and possibly agreement of and between independent decision-making units. Nobody could argue in favor of a property system defining borders of property in subjective, evaluative terms because simply to be able to say so presupposes that, contrary to what theory says, one must in fact be a physically independent unit saying it.

The situation is no less dire for alternative ethical proposals when one turns to the second essential specification of the rulings of the libertarian theory of property. The basic norms of libertarianism are characterized not only by the fact that property and aggression are defined in physical terms; it is of no less importance that property is defined as private, individualized property and that the meaning of original appropriation, which evidently implies making a distinction between prior and later, has been specified. It is with this additional specification as well that alternative, nonlibertarian ethics come into conflict. Instead of recognizing the vital importance of the prior-later distinction in deciding between conflicting property claims, they propose norms which in effect state that priority is irrelevant for making such a decision and that late-comers have as much of a right to ownership as first-comers. Clearly, this idea is involved when redistributive socialism makes the natural owners of wealth and/or their heirs pay a tax so that the unfortunate late-comers can participate in its consumption. It is also involved when the owner of a natural resource is forced to reduce (or increase) its present exploitation in the interest of posterity. Both times it only makes sense to do what one does when it is assumed that the person accumulating wealth first, or using the natural resource first, has thereby committed an aggression against some late-comers. If they had done nothing wrong, then the late-comers should have no such claim against them.[^31]

[^31]: For an awkward philosophical attempt to justify a late-comer ethic see James P. Sterba, *The Demands of Justice* (Notre Dame, Ind.: Notre Dame University Press, 1980), esp. pp. 58ff., 137ff.; on the absurdity of such an ethic see Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*, p. 427.

What is wrong with this idea of dropping the prior-later distinction as morally irrelevant? First, if the late-comers (those who did not do something with some scarce goods), indeed had as much of a right to them as the first-comers (those who did do something with the scarce goods), then nobody would ever be allowed to do anything with anything, as one would have to have all of the late-comers’ consent prior to doing what one wanted to do. Indeed, as posterity would include one’s children’s children—people who come so late that one could not possibly ask them—to advocate a legal system that does not make use of the prior-later distinction as part of its underlying property theory is simply absurd because it implies advocating death but must presuppose life to advocate anything. Neither we, nor our forefathers, nor our progeny could, do, or will survive and say or argue anything if one followed this rule. In order for any person—past, present or future—to argue anything it must be possible to survive now. Nobody can wait and suspend acting until everyone of an indeterminate class of late-comers happens to come around and agree to what one wants to do. Rather, insofar as a person finds himself alone, he must be able to act, to use, to produce, and to consume goods straightaway, prior to any agreement with people who are simply not around (and perhaps never will be). Insofar as a person finds himself in the company of others and there is conflict over how to use a given scarce resource, he must be able to resolve the problem at a definite point in time with a definite number of people instead of having to wait unspecified periods of time for unspecified numbers of people. Simply in order to survive, then, which is a prerequisite to arguing in favor or against anything, property rights cannot be conceived of as being timeless and nonspecific regarding the number of people concerned. Rather, they must be thought of as originating through acting at definite points in time for definite acting individuals.[^32]

[^32]: It should be noted here that only if property rights are conceptualized as private property rights originating in time does it then become possible to make contracts. Clearly enough, contracts are agreements between enumerable physically independent units which are based on the mutual recognition of each contractor’s private ownership claims to things acquired prior in time to the agreement and which then concern the transfer of property titles to definite things from a definite prior to a definite later owner. No such thing as contracts could conceivably exist in the framework of a late-comer ethic!

Furthermore, the idea of abandoning the prior-later distinction would simply be incompatible with the nonaggression principle as the practical foundation of argumentation. To argue and possibly agree with someone (if only on the fact that there is disagreement) means to recognize the prior right of exclusive control over one’s own body. Otherwise, it would be impossible for anybody to say anything at a definite point in time and for someone else to be able to reply, for neither the first nor the second speaker would be a physically independent decision-making unit anymore at any time. Eliminating the prior-later distinction, then, is tantamount to eliminating the possibility of arguing and reaching agreement. However, as one cannot argue that there is no possibility for discussion without the prior control of every person over his own body being recognized and accepted as fair, a late-comer ethic that does not make this distinction could never be agreed upon by anyone. Simply *saying* that it could be would imply a contradiction, for one’s being able to say so would presuppose one’s existence for an independent decision-making unit at a definite point in time.

Hence, one is forced to conclude that the libertarian ethic not only can be justified and justified by means of a priori reasoning, but that no alternative ethic can be defended argumentatively.
