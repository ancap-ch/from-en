Second, dem must to systematically encourage de use of money substitute instead of gold, dem must use de enactment of legal tender law take back up de tendency. De counterfeiting process nor go come cost too much. Instead of to remint gold, na papee ticket dem go print.

Howeva, de problem wey we don talk about beofre stilk dey. As long as de system of free banking still dey operate, dem nor go fit stop de counteefeit note dem to return to new issuer with de request for redemption, and im sef nor go fit— at least nor be without contractive adjustment— do de thing im suppose do. To over dis thing wey block road so, for de next step de state must to monopolize de banking system or use force do turn de banks wey dey compete to carter for under de teaching of im own state-operated central bank. Once e don dey for de command of monopolized or cartelized banking system, de state go fit put de coordinated and joint counterfeit process of de whole banking system for effect so dat im go fit avoid dis risk.

For de next step gold must to be nationalized, as in, de state must to ask all bank dem to deposit dia gokd for de central bank and do dia business with money substitute instead of gold. Dis way gold gi disappear from de market as wetin dem dey use do exchange and instead every day transaction go begin use central banknotes.

 Last last, as gold don comot go enter de hand of de state, de state must to cut all tie to gold, as im go refuse to do wetin im suppose do den come declare say im note nor dey redeemable. As dem build for where gold don leave waka, wey ask na commodity money standar wey im be, been don make am possible make paper note fit buy anythin, pure Fiat money standard don stand straight  and now dem fit use am for operation, for long time, to give de state de unlimited counterfeiting powee wey im don dey compete for.

De goal wey one complete counterfeiting autonomy get dey also dictate de strategy wey dem must pursue for de psychological front. As e clear reach  as e dey approach im ultimate goal de statw dey create victim dem and so e dey in need  of public opinion wey go favour am. im rise to confam counterfeiting power must to dey accompanied with redistributive measure dem wey generate de support wey det necessary to overcome all de forces of resistance wey dey come. E must find  people wey go support am.

As e regard de monopolization of law and ordee of de state, traffic, communication and education and de democratization of im organizational structure — while e dey clear say na redistributive measures wey dem be and so e mean say to fovour one person at de expense of anoda—  e nor dey easy, if e nor even dey impossible to identify de gainers dem and de loser with social classes dem: gainers (or losers) fit dey for different classes: for inside one social class gainers and losers fit dey; and de pattern wey redistribution dey take happen fit shift over time. For all of dis casses dem de link wey dey between de state redistributive expenditure dem and dia payoffs nor dey direct: weda or not some kind education expenditures, for instance, bring beta oay for term of increased state income go only dey visible afta; and even den e go dey hard to say cos of one definite cause wey  happen. For de case of de monopolization of money and banking, for de oda hand, which person for outside de apparatus of de state im sef go follow benefit for im redistributive policy dem and who wey dem clear de loser at once; and sociologically and de benefactor dem go dey easily identified with some kind social class. for dis case de connection wet dey between de state to give redistributive favour and enrich im sef dey direct and close-circuited; and de attribution of causes dey clear to see: De state dey compelled to make bank dem and social class of banker dem im accomplice, as e allow dem to participate inside im counterfeiting operations and so dem enrich dem dia sef with de state own enrichment.

Bankers go be de first people wey go dey aware of dey attempts wey state get for counterfeiting. Without special incentives for de contrary dem nor go get any reason why dem go support dat kin action and any reason wey dem go  fit use uncover and stop dem quick quick. And de state nor go run enter any kind of opposition here: bankers, bcus dem dey high position for deir economic life and bcus of deir far-reaching interconnectedness as professional group wey result from de nature of deir business as facilitators of interspatial and intertemporal exchanges, fit be de most formidable opposition wey person fit encounter. De incentive wey dey necessary to turn dat kin potential enemies to natural allies na de state offer say dem go turn dem to deir own fraudulent machinations. Familiar with de ideas wey dey counterfeiting and e great potential for person enrichment, but knowing, too, say change to engage am nor dey witout say e go run into immediate risk of bankruptcy under free, competitive banking and gold standard, bankers dey always face temptation wey  dem no fit resist. If person wan follow de state’s policy of monopolizing money and banking cum mean say person dey fulfill e dream of getting rich fast. Nor be only de state fit cum into e own once pure fiat money standard don dey established. Provided say dem accord dem de privilege by dr state say make dem counterfeit add to deir own counterfeited note wey dey under monetary regime wey dey less than 100-percent-reserve banking, wey de central bank dey function  as de last resort counterfeiter banks fit dey easy persuaded make dem regard de establishment of dat kind monetary system as dia ultimate goal and as  universal panacea.[^16]

Economically, dis kind coalition wey dey between de state—as de dominant partner—and de banking system—as dia affiliate— go lead to permanent inflation (wey be say the only thing  wey hold dem na make dem  nor over do am so dat de entire monetary system no go breakdown), so dat credit expansion and steadily recurring boom-bust cycles go dey, and to a smooth uninterrupted income and wealth redistribution so dat de state and de bank go dey favoured.

Wetin dey more important pass, na de sociological implications wey dey for dis alliance: as dem form am, a ruling class wey e interest dey tied well well with de state go dey established inside de civil society. Through dia cooperation de state go fit carry e force power reach every area wey dey de society.

Before dem establish de state-banking-alliance, de sociological  separation wey dey  between de state and de society, as in, between de class wey dey exploit people and de class wey dem dey exploit, de almost complete and e dey clearly visible. Here na civil society wey dey produce all de economic wealth; and dere na de state and deir representative wey dey draw parasitically on top wetin odas don produce. People fit be member of either de civil society or de state and dem dey make sure say deir own interests dey connected wit either de former or de latter. If we wan dey sure, redistributive activities dey go on wey favour some part of de society while odas no go dey favoured and e dey divert interest to pursue economic integration to dey one wey dey support exploitation. Upon dat, social corruption dey unsystematic for dis stage. Nor be corruption of social classes dey connected society-wide, but na de corruption of disparate and dispersed individuals abi groups. And dis interests only dey connected to dose of de state wey dey weak thru specific redistributive state activities, instead of thru direct cash-connection.

As dem come form state-banking alliance, all dis go bcum different. Cash-connection between some part of de civil society and de state go exist - and notin dey bring people togeda wey pass joint financial interests. Morever, dis kin connection dey happen between de state  and de tin wey we nor fit identify as closely interconnected class, but as one of de class wey dey influencial and powerful. In fact, nor be only de bank join interest wit de state on dia policy of exploitation. De major clients of de bank, de business establishment and de leaders wey de industry don become deeply integrated for de state counterfeiting schemes, too. Becos apart from de state and banks, na dem be de earliest receivers of de counterfeit money wey dem dey create regularly.  If dem receive am gradually before e ripple thru de economic system, and e go change de relative prices cum even increase the overall price level, and if dem receive credit for fraudulently lower interest rate, dem too dey enrich demsef at de expense of all savers and oda recipients abi nonrecipient of dis money.[^17]

Moreova, dis financial coalition wey dey between industrial  establishment, banks, and de state dey reinforced by each successive course of events. De credit expansion dey lead to increase for investment and - since e nor dey covered by increase for genuine savings - e go lead to corrective contraction. To avoid losses abi bankruptcy de bank customer go approach de banking system so dat e go demand increase for liquitiy (as in, money). Naturally, if bank wan avoid losses, dem dey eager to help dia clients out - and de dem dey do am, dey more dem go dey established as clients. If dem nor fit do dis on deir own, dem go turn to de state and e central bank. And de state, go get opportunity for him own enrichment, e go accept and even provide de banking system, and de business establishment, wit de liquidity wey dem need thru new round of counterfeiting. De alliance go cum dey renewed, and de state don confirm him dominant role again as e don save de established banking and industrial elite so dat dem nor go crumble for de face of economic competition so dat dem go preserve deir status quo abi even increase de wealth wey don already plenty for dia hand. Reason don dey to be thankful and even reciprocate wit invigorated public support for de state and dia propaganda.

To be sure, dis coalition wey dey between de state and de economic power elite nor mean complete identity of interest. De different establish industrial enterprises fit get different abi contrary interest: and de same na tru for banks. Similarly, de interest of banks and business clients fit different in many respects. And nor be say de interest of industrial elites abi de bank coincide togeda wit state own. Becos after all, banks togeda wit business enterprises also dey inside de normal business of making money thru production and productive exchanges - whatever oda sources of income wey dey available to dem. And inside dis function, deir interest fit clash wit de desire of de state for taxes, for example. Upon dat, de establishment of system of monopolized money and banking go still create one interest wey dey common to all of dem: interest wey dey for de preservation of de apparatus of de state and de institution of political (as in, exploitative) means wey dem go take appropriate income like dat. Nor be only say State and him central bank fit scatter any commercial bank and, indirectly, practically any oda industrial enterprise; dis threat dey very serious de more de business dey kampe. De state fit help any abi all of dem get more money, dem fit even don already get money. Hence, de more dem fit lose from from opposition abi to gain from compliance, de more de economic power go try make attempt make dem enter de state apparatus cum even make de state leaders make dem get financial interest inside de world of business. Bankers and industrialists de bcum politicians; and politicians dey take positions inside banking and industry. Social system go cum start and na de main characteristics of de modern world wey state with banks wey dey close to dem and even  dem business leaders go dey  cheat everyone else.[^18][^19]

[^18]: In de Marxist tradition this stage of social development is termed “monopoly capitalism”, “finance capitalism”, or “state monopoly capitalism”.

::::De descriptive part wey dey inside Marxist analyses dey very valuable. If we wan find de close person and financial links wey dey state and business, dem dey always paint much more realistic picture of de present economic order pass de way dem dey do some starry-eyed “bourgeois economists”. Analytically, however, dem dey get almost everything wrong cum turn de truth upside down.

::::De traditional, pre-Marxist view wey dey correct on exploitation na de radical laissez-faire liberalism wey for example,Charles Comte and Charles Dunoyer bring. According to dem, antagonistic interests nor exist between capitalists as de owners of factors of production with laborers, but between, on top anoda hand, de producers wey dey de society, i.e., homesteaders, producers and contractors, including businessmen and even workers, for anoda hand, dose people wey gada wealth nonproductively with/abi noncontractually, as in, de state togeda wit stateprivileged groups, like feudal landlords. De first person wey first confuse dis distinction na Saint-Simon, wey dem Comte and Dunoyer influence one certain time like dat, and wey even classify market businessmen togeda wit feudal lords and oda stateprivileged groups as cheaters. Marx cum carry dis confusion wey Saint-Simon do cum even add more confusion on top am by making only capitalists cheaters and all workers as people wey dem cheat, e cum justify dis view thru Ricardian labor theory of value and him theory of surplus value. Essentially, dis view on exploitation cum remain typical for Marxism up till today upon say Böhm-Bawerk’s scatter Marx’s exploitation theory and him explanation of de difference  wey dey between factor prices and output prices through time preference (interest). Up till today, anytime wey Marxist theorists dey talk about de exploitative character of monopoly capitalism, dem dey see de real cause of did as private ownership of means of production still dey exist. Even if dem dem admit say e get some  degree of independence wey state apparatus get from de class of monopoly capitalists (as in de version of “state monopoly capitalism”), for dem nor be de state makes capitalist exploitation possible; instead, na bcos na State be de agency of capitalism, an organization wey dey transform de narrow-minded interests of individual capitalists into de interest of ideal universal capitalist (de *ideelle Gesamtkapitalist*), wey be say na him cum explain de existence of exploitation.

::::In fact, as dem explain give, de truth na de correct opposite: Na de state by dem nature dey exploitative, and capitalists fit engage inside exploitation only if dem join hands wit de state  and stop to be capitalists. Instead of say we go dey talk about state monopoly capitalism, den, e go better if we call de present system “state financed monopoly socialism”, or “bourgeois socialism”.

[^19]: If we wan recognize de far-reaching integration wey dey between state interests togeda wit economic power elite, wey de monopolization of money  and banking  cause, nor be say conflict nor fit start inside dis coalition. Just like we mention for up, state dey characterized, for example, since dem wan democratize dia  own constitution. And de democratic process fit bring egalitarian or populist sentiments cum up wey dey  oppose to de favorable treatment wey state dey give banks and big business. However, de  financial nature of de state-business connection na him make dat kind occurrence unlikely. Nor be only threat e go pose to de economic power elite; e go also mean serious financial losses for de state income, even if e nor threaten de stability of de state lik dat. Hence powerful incentive dey for both sides make dem join forces so dat dem go filter any kind of sentiment comot for de political process before e ever become widely heard and to ensure say de range of political alternative wey  dey admitted to  public discussion dey restricted so dat dem no go fit scrutinize dia joint counterfeiting racket wit all de resources wey dey dia command.
