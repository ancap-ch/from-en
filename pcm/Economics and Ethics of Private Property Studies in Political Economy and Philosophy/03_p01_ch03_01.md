## Banking, Nation States, and International Politics: A Sociological Reconstruction of de Present Economic Order

### Money and Banking

For make we explain as barter carry come out, we nor need anytin pass de assumption sef interest. As far as man dey like plenty choice dem and goods dem pass small ones, im go choose barter and division of labour instead of sef-sufficiency.

As money take come out from barter sef, follow for de same narrow sef-interest. If dem put man inside barter economy, and im come choose high standard of living instead of lower, im go also choose and support one common way to exchange. As im choose de type money wey im want, im go fit overcome de restriction wey barter economy don put on top exchange dem, as in de one wey go need double coincidence of want to happen. With money e go dey possible for to do exchange. Im go fit exchange every goods with anoda ones, de goods nor go depend on top double coincidence or divisibility dem wey nor dey perfect. And as de exchangeability don wide so, de value of goods wey im get go increase.

Just as if dem don put man for inside one exchange economy, sef-interest go make am dey look for some kind goods dem wey go fit sell, we get de kind money property dem wey im want, like goods wey im fit divids, goods wey go last, good wey people fit recognise, goods wey dem fit carry and good wey nor too dey ground, and to ask for dose kind goods sake of  to use dem as media exchange. And na for im own interest to choose dat goods as im own medium of exchange just as oda people dey follow use am. Infact na the work of money to help de exchange wake, to am dey very possible for ezchnage to happen, and dat way im go also increase de value of goods dem (to de point wey dem go look like dem follow for exchange economy). And so, de more wey people dey use commodity as money , de more wey de commodity go do im work as money. And as sef-interest go be wetin dey push am, man go always like medium of exchange wey dey general, and universal pass de one wey nor dey less general and wey nor dey universal. For as de money common reach, na so de market wey person dey inside go wide, and na so value and cost calculation go make sense (from de way wey person wey want economic integration and make im wealth big well, dey see am) and na so de benefit big reach wet person fit get from division of labor.[^1]

True true, de commodity wey dem first choose as de best-cos-most-universal-money na gold. if government nor us force, dem for choose gold again for de near future as de commodity wey dey do de work of money wella. Sef-interset go make every body to like make gold be — de medium of exchange wey dem dey use universally — pass any oda money. To de point wey everybody go dey see dem sef and wetin dem get like sey dem don enter exchange economy, dem ho prefer accounting with gold instead of with any oda money , cos de way everybody accept gold go make dat kind acvounting to be de most complete way wey dem fit show opportunity cost, and so e go serve as de best guide for person wey want expand im wealth. dem go stop to use all oda money dem quick quick, cos anytin wey nor dey up to de money wey everybody dey use, just like gold—weda na national or regional money dem— go contradict de very reason of to get money for de first place. Na man wey get sef-interest wey invent money just so dat im go increase im wealth,as im put im self inside ever-wide and ultimately universal market. As dem dey pursue sef interest, gold go quick win national and regional money dem, cos na only gold dey make economic intergration complete and market dem worldwide, dat way im don do de ultimate work of money as common way to do exchange.[^2]

De emergence of money, better money dem and finally of one universal money, gold, dey free productive energy wey don dey frustrated and idle cos of dem restrict two-coincidence-of-want for de process of exchanges ( just like de existence of money dem wey dey compete with each oda with exchange rate wey dey freely go up and down). for under barter de market of producer output dey restricted for de kind times wen double want happen. As all prices go dey show for gold de producer market dey likely encompassing, and demand dey happen without any absence of any double coincidence to restrict am for world wide scale. Just like dat, production dey increase — and e dey increase wella with gold pass any oda money. As production increase, de value of money dey rise too, and as purchasing power of money go high na so e people wey dey book am go reduce, e go lower effective rate of time preference (de obonge rate of interest) and e dey make capital formation to increase. Se spiraling process of economic development wey dey go upward don dey in motion

Dis development dey create de basis for de emergence of banks as institution dem wey specialise for money-handling. For de oda hand, bank dem dey help to meet de demand wey dey on de rise for safekeeping, transporting and clearing of money. On de oda hand, dem dey fulfil de function wey dey rise of to help do exchange for capitalist (savers) and entrepreneurs (investors), and dem dey also make division of labour wey nearly complete possible for dese two roles dem. As institution dem of deposit and just like saving and credit institution dem, bank dey quick quick become nerve center of economy. As e dey increase, de spatial and temporal allocation and coordination of economic resource dem and activities dey happen cos of de mediation of bank dem; and also to facilitate dis type of coordination de emergence of bank dem means sey na anoda push for economic growth.[^3].

While dis one concern everybody economic interest say make only one universal money and only one unit account dey, and as man dey pursue  wealth maximization im nor go stop until im get am, e nor blend with dat kind interest sey make only on bank dey or one monopolistic banking system. Instead, self-interest dey command say make every bank dey use de same universal money —wey be gold—and make competition nor dey between oda money ddm, but instead make competition dey between bank an banking system dem wey dey use gold. Only if free entry  into bank dey exist wey cost efficiency go dey for dis business or any oda business;  even so, na only as long as dis competition concern services wey dem give for terms of one and de same money commodity wey free banking go fit fulfil de very function of money ad banking, as in, to help economic integration instead of disintegration, to make de market wide and to expand de division of labor instead of to restrict dem, to make value and cost accounting make sense wella instead of small, and so to increase instead of to decrease economic wealth. De tori of competition between money dem na *contradiction in adjecto*. As we dey talk, monetary system with rival money dem of exchange rates wey dey free to go up and down na still system of (partial) barter, with de problem of to need double coincidence dem of want just so dat (some kind) exchanges go happen. De existence of dat kind of system nor dey help de very purpose of money[^4] as e dey pursue im own sef-interest, man go quick quick abandon am—and e go be fundamental misconception as e regard why money dey important to think of de free market for terms competitive money dem nor be only competing banks. Competitive money dem nor be de result of wetin free market do but dem be de result of force, of de obstacle wey government put for de direction of rational economic conduct.

Say free banking wey base ontop universal gold standard begin come out, we go don win de goal of achieving de biggest cost efficient solution wey go coordinate and  help to push interspatial  and intertemporal exchanges to happen inside de framework of market wey dey universally integrated. De price for safekeeping service, to transport and to clear money , even for to advance money for time contract go drop low wella for regime of free entry. And since dem go show dis prices dem for term of one universal money, de prices go really reflect de smallest cost dem of market-integrative services.

To add more to de mata, banks dia competition plus including de fact say money must come out as commodity — just like gold—wey for addition to im value as money wey im be, get commodity value and so dem nor go fit produce am with low cost-expenditure, and e dey also provide de best possible safeguard against fraudulent banking. 

Just like de instruction to deposit money, bank dem— just like oda institution dem wey dey deposit commodity wey dem go fit exchange, yet e dey happen wella with bans cos of de special role of de commodity money— dey tempted to give “fake” warehouse receipts as in note of deposit wey real money nor cover, as soon as dose kind banknote become real money substitute and market people begin treat am as confam equal of real money wey dem deposit. For dis situation, as dem issue fake or fiat banknotes wey we nor fit sabi de difference from original money substitute, one bank go fit — Use fraud, and for oda people expense— to increase im own wealth. E fit buy good with dat fake note dem and so enrich im sef just as oda people wey dey use simple counterfeit. De bank real wealth and de wealth of dose people wey receive de money early go increase as dem dey buy things, and for de same time and through de same thing de wealth of people wey receive de new money late or wey nor receive am at all go decrease, cos of de consequence of inflation wey counterfeit dey bring. Or one bank fit use dat fiat money take expand im credit den chop interest on top am. We don see am again, fraudulent income and wealth distribution wey favour de bank don happen.[^6] to add to am, dis dem don set boom-bust cycle for motion: Wen dem place de newly granted credit dem for lowered rate, e dey cause investment to increase and e dey cause big boom wey dem nor sabi de difference from economic expansion; howeva, dis boom must bust cos de credit wey push am nor represent real savings instead e come from no where. And so, with all de new and investment structure wey don expand under way, lack of capital go hapoen wey go make de successful completion of all investment projects systematically impossible and instead e go require contraction with liquidation of before investment wey nor happen well[^7]

For under de gokd standard any bank or banking system (plus including a monopolist one) go dey constrained for im own inclination to fall for dat kind temptation by two thing wey successful counterfeiting require. For one hand, de banking public nor suppose suspect de trustworthiness of de bank — as in, dia anti-fraud vigilance must dey low oda wise bank run go quick quick show de fraud wey don happen. For de oda hand, de  bank nor go fit inflate im notes for short time wey go make de public lose confidence for de purchasing power of de note, to make dem reduce demand, den come run go real value dem, including real money, and dat way de person wey do de counterfeit go poor. For under de system of free banking, howeva, wen legal tender law nor dey dey and dem use gold as money, and additional constrain go rise on top potential bank fraud, dat time na every bank go face de existence of nonclients or clients of different bank dem. If for dis situation van bring additional counterfeit money to circulate , e must to reckon with de fact say de money fit end up with nonclient dem wey ask for quick redemption, wey de bank nor go fit grant, without painful credit contraction. In fact, dem go only fit avoid dat kind corrective contraction if de additional fial money go enter for inside cash reserves of bank own clients and de use am for transaction with oda client dem. Yet since de bank no go get way to sabi weda or not dem go fit achieve dat outcome, or how dem go achieve am, de threat of credit contraction wey go follow go act as inescapable economic deterrent to any bank fraud[^8]

[^8]: What of cartels? de  banks we dey compete nor for fit form one cartel come agree on top one joint venture on top counterfeiting? Again, For under free banking, dis one na most unlikely, cos system of free banking dey characterized by complete absence of economy incentive for cartelization. As restriction of entry nor dey, any bank cartel like dat good nid to dey classified  as wetin dey voluntary and e go suffer from de same problem as any cartel wey dey voluntary: wen threat of noncartelist and/or new entrants dey im front, and wen e recognise say like all cartel agreements, banking cartel go favor de cartel members wey dey less efficient for de expense of ones we dey more efficient, economic basis nor dey for succesful action, and if dem try to cartelize e go scatter quick quick cos e nor economically efficient. To add more, as far as say dem nor go use de counterdeit money to expans credit, banks wey dey act for concert go set full-scale boom-bust cycle wey go blow. Dis one too go spoil catelization.  See dis one for de tori of free banking Mises, *Human Action*, pp. 434–48; Rothbard, *The Mystery of Banking*, chap. VIII.
