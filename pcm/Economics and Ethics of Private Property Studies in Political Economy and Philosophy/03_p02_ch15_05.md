### De Restoration of Morality: On Liberation

Wetin we for do? Rothbard don not only reconstruct de ethics of liberty and explain de current morass as de result of statism; e don also show us de way toward a restoration of morals dem. 

First and foremost, e don explain say states, as powerful and invincible as dem fit be, ultimately owe dem existence to ideas, and since ideas fit change instantaneously in principle, dem fit bring down and practically crumble states overnight.

De representatives of de state dey everywhere always just be one small minority of de total population on top wich dem dey rule. De reason for dis ting dey simple as em dey fundamental sef: one hundred parasites fit live comfortable lives if dem suck out de life blood of thousands of productive hosts, but thousands of parasites no fit live comfortably off on top a population of just a hundred. Yet, if government agents just merely be one small minority of de population, how dem go fit enforce dem will on top dis population make dem still get away wit am? De answer wey Rothbard and de la Boétie, Hume, and Mises before am be only say na by virtue of de voluntary cooperation of de majority of de subject population wit de state. Yet how de state go fit secure dat kin cooperation? De answer na only becos and insofar as de majority of de population believe de legitimacy wey state rule get. Dis no be to say dat de majority of de population gat agree wit all of de state measure wey dey. Indeed, e fit come believe say many of de kin state policies dey mistaken or despicable. Howeva, de majority of de population gat believe in de justice of de state like dat, and hence, dat even if one particular government go wrong, dis mistakes merely be accidents wey dem gat accept and tolerate in view of some greater good wey de institution of government provide.

Yet, how we go make de majority of de population to believe dis? De answer dey wit de help of de intellectuals. For de old days e go mean to dey try to hold an alliance between de state and de church. For de modern times and far more effectively, dis mean say through de nationalization (socialization) of education: through de state-run or state-subsidized schools and universities. De market demand for intellectual services, in particular in de area of de humanities and social sciences, is not exactly high and none too stable and secure. Intellectuals go be at de mercy of de values and choices of de masses dem, and generally de masses nor dey interested in intellectual philosophical concerns. De state, on de oder hand, notes Rothbard, accommodate dem typically conflated egos and “dey willing to offer de intellectuals a warm, secure, and permanent berth for dem apparatus, a secure income, and de panoply of prestige”. Indeed, de modern democratic state in particular, don create one massive oversupply of intellectuals.

Dis accomomodation nor guarantee “correct” – statist- thinking, of course; and as well and generally overpaid as dem be, intellectuals go continue to dey complain of how little dem oh-so-important work dey dey appreciated by dose wey dem power pass power. But e certainly dey help to dey reach de “correct” conclusions if one realize say without de state- de institutions of taxation and legislation- peson fit lose em work and start to dey try hands for de mechanics of gas pump operation instead of to dey emself wit pressing problems like alienation, equity, exploitation, de construction of gender and sex roles, or de culture of dem Eskimos, de Hopis, and de Zulus. Furthermore, even if peson dey underappreciated by dis or dat incumbent government, peson go still realise say help only fit come from another government like dat. Thus, e nor dey too surprising say, as matter of empirical fact, de overwhelming majority of contemporary intellectuals dey far-out left and even say most of de conservative or free market intellectuals such as Friedman or Hayek dem, for instance, be fundamentally and philosophically statists. 

From dis insight into de importance wey ideas and de role wey intellectuals get as bodyguards for de state and statism, e follow say de most decisive role for de process wey liberation get- de restoration for justice and morality- gat fall on de shoulder of wetin peson fit call anti-intellectual intellectuals. Yet how such anti-intellectual intellectuals possibly fit succeed for delegitimizing de state for public opinion, especially if de overwhelming majority of dem colleagues be statists and dem go do everything foe dem power to isolate and discredit dem as extremists and crackpots? Time permits only one small short comments on dis fundamental question.

First, peson gat reckon wit the vicious opposition from peson colleagues. To withstand de opposition, e dey very important to ground peson case nor for economics and utilitarianism, but for ethics and moral arguments, cos na only moral convictions dey provide peson wit de courage and strength needed for ideological battle. Few dey inspired and willing to accept sacrifices if wetin dem dey opposed to be mere error and waste. E fit draw more inspiration and courage from knowing say e dey engaged for fighting of evil and lies. (I dey com back to dis shortly.)

Second, e dey important to recognize say peson nor need to convert peson colleagues, i.e., to persuade mainstream intellectuals. As Thomas Kuhn don show, e dey rare enough even for de natural sciences. For de social sciences, conversions among established intellectuals from previously held views dey almost unheard of. Instead, peson suppose concentrate em effort on de not-yet intellectually committed young, whose idealism dey make dem also particularly receptive to moral arguments and moral rigorism. Likewise, peson suppose circumvent academia and reach out to de general public (i.e., to de educated laymen), wich dey entertain some generally healthy anti-intellectual prejudices inside wich peson fit tap easily. 

Third, make we return to de importance of a moral attack on de state, e dey essential to recognize say more compromise on de level of theory nor fit dey. To dey sure, peson nor suppose refuse to cooperate wit people wey get views wey go dey ultimately mistaken and confused, *provided* that their objectives can be classified clearly and unambiguously as a step in the right direction of the de-statization of society. For instance, one would not want to refuse cooperation with people who seek to introduce a flat income tax of 10 percent (although one would not want to cooperate with those who would want to combine this measure with an increased sales tax in order to achieve revenue neutrality, for instance). However, under no circumstances should such cooperation lead to or be achieved by compromising one’s own principles. Either taxation is just or it is not. Once it is accepted as just, how is one to oppose any increase in it? The answer is of course that one cannot!

Put differently, compromise on the level of theory, as we find it, for instance, among moderate free-marketeers such as Hayek or Friedman or even among the so-called minarchists, is not only philosophically flawed but is also practically ineffective and indeed counterproductive. Their ideas can be—and in fact are—easily co-opted and incorporated by the state rulers and statist ideology. Indeed, how often do we hear nowadays from statists and in defense of a statist agenda cries such as “even Hayek (Friedman) says”, or, “not even Hayek (Friedman) denies that such and such must be done by the state”! Personally, they may not be happy about this, but there is no denying that their work lends itself to this purpose, and hence, that they actually contributed to the continued and unabated growth of state power.

In other words, theoretical compromise or gradualism will only lead to the perpetuation of the falsehood, evils, and lies of statism, and only theoretical purism, radicalism, and intransigence can and will lead first to gradual practical reform and improvement and then possibly to final victory. Accordingly, as an anti-intellectual intellectual in the Rothbardian sense, one can never be satisfied with criticizing various government follies although one might have to begin with this, but one must always proceed from there to a fundamental attack on the institution of the state as a moral outrage and its representatives as moral as well as economic frauds, liars, and impostors—as emperors without clothes.

Specifically, one must never hesitate to strike at the very heart of the legitimacy of the state: its alleged indispensable role as producer of private protection and security. I have already shown how ridiculous this claim is on theoretical grounds: how can an agency that may expropriate private property possibly claim to be a protector of private property? It is hardly less important to attack the legitimacy of the state in this regard on empirical grounds by pointing out and hammering at the fact that states, which are supposed to protect us, are the very institutions responsible for an estimated 170 million deaths in the twentieth century alone—more than the victims of private crime in all of human history! And this number of victims of private crimes, from which government did not protect us, would have been much lower if governments everywhere and at all times had not undertaken constant efforts to disarm their own citizens so that the governments in turn could become ever more effective killing machines!

Instead of treating politicians with respect, then, one’s criticism of them should be significantly stepped up. Almost to a man they are not only thieves but mass murderers. How dare they demand our respect and loyalty?

But will a sharp and distinct ideological radicalization bring the desired results? I have no doubt. Indeed, only radical and indeed radically simple ideas can possibly stir the emotions of the dull and indolent masses and delegitimize government in their eyes.

Let me quote Hayek to this effect (and in doing so, I hope to indicate also that my rather harsh earlier criticism of him should not be misunderstood as implying that one cannot learn anything from authors who are fundamentally wrong and muddled):

> We must make the building of a free society once more an intellectual adventure, a deed of courage. What we lack is a liberal Utopia, a programme which seems neither a mere defence of things as they are nor a diluted kind of socialism, but a truly liberal radicalism which does not spare the susceptibilities of the mighty... which is not too severely practical and which does not confine itself to what appears today as politically possible. We need intellectual leaders who are prepared to resist the blandishments of power and influence and who are willing to work for an ideal, however small may be the prospects of its early realization. They must be men who are willing to stick to principles and to fight for their full realization, however remote. ...Free trade and freedom of opportunity are ideas which still may arouse the imaginations of large numbers, but a mere “reasonable freedom of trade” or a mere “relaxation of controls” is neither intellectually respectable nor likely to inspire any enthusiasm....
>
> Unless we can make the philosophic foundations of a free society once more a living intellectual issue, and its implementation a task which challenges the ingenuity and imagination of our liveliest minds, the prospects of freedom are indeed dark. But if we can regain that belief in the power of ideas which was the mark of liberalism at its best, the battle is not lost.[^2]

Hayek did not heed his own advice and provide us with a consistent and inspiring theory. His Utopia, as developed in his *Constitution of Liberty*, is the rather uninspiring vision of the Swedish welfare state. Instead, it is Rothbard who has done what Hayek recognized as necessary for a renewal of classical liberalism; and if there is anything that can reverse the seemingly unstoppable tide of statism and restore justice and liberty, it is the personal example set by Murray Rothbard and the spread of Rothbardianism.
