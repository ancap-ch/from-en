### Simple Solution, Radical Conclusions: Anarchy and State

As simple as solution of social order problem dey and as long as say people for their daily lives dey intuitively sabi say and behave according to d ethics of private property way we just explain, dis solution way dey simple and no dey demand anything dey try mean some surprising radical conclusions. Apart from say dey comot as unjustified all dem d activities way be to kill person (murder), homicide, rape, to disturb another person (trespass), to rob person (robbery), to break enter person house(burglary), to thief person (theft), and to do person 419 (fraud), d ethics of private property no also dey compatible with say state dem define as agency dey exist and way get one kind by-force territorial monopoly to dey make d ultimate decision (jurisdiction) and/or con get right on top tax

Dem Classical political theory, at least way from Hobbes onward, don see d state as d institution way dey responsible to dey enforce d ethics of private property. To dey regard d state say e dey unjust-indeed, as one "big criminal organization"-and and con reach anarchist conclusions instead, Rothbard no deny d necessity to enforce d ethics of private property. Him no con share d view of dem dose anarchist, way him teacher and mentor Mises dey use am laugh, him bin belife say all dem d people, if dem leave dem, go dey good and go creatures way like peace.

Way dey contrary, Rothbard bin comot all him mind agree with Mises say people way dey kill person (murderers) go always dey, dem thieves, agbero (thug), con-artists, etc., and say life for society go dey impossible if dem no punish dem with physical force, instead, watin Rothbard categorically deny na d claim say e follow from d right and d need to protect person and property say protection rightfully suppose or effectively fit dey provided by monopolist of jurisdiction and taxation. To make dia claim, classical political theory suppose present d state as result of one contractual agreement among dem d private property owners. Rothbard bin argue say e dey false and na undertaking way dey impossible. No state fit possibly arise contractually: accordingly e fit dey demonstrated as say no state dey compatible with d rightful and effective protection of private property.

To get private-property, as result of act of original appropriation, production, or exchange from old owner go new owner, try mean say d owner get right to exclusive jurisdiction on top him property: and no private property owner fit possibly surrender him right to ultimate jurisdiction on top and physical defense of him property give another person expect him sell or say him transfer him property (way be say another person go get exclusive jurisdiction on top am). To dey sure, every private property owner fit partake for d advantage way dey division of labour and con find more or better protection of him property through cooperation with dem other owners and dia property. Mean say, all dem d property owners fit buy from, sell give, or otherwise contract with any other person concerning more or better protection of property, and all dem d property owner fit at any time unilaterally stop any of cooperation way dey with others or change him respective affiliations. Hence, to meet d demand for protection, it go dey rightfully possible and economically likely say individuals way dey specialized and dem agencies fit arise to give protection, insurance and arbitration services for fee give voluntary clients way pay.

While e dey easy to conceive d contractual origin of one system way get competitive security suppliers, e no dey conceivable how private property owners fit possibly enter one contract way go entitle another agent irrevocably (once and for all) with d power to make ultimate decision regarding him own person and property and/or d power on to tax. Mean say, e dey inconceivable how anybody fit ever agree to contract way go allow another person to permanently decide watin him fit and watin him no fit do with him property, for say if him do am, him don effectively make himself dey defenseless vis-avis dat kind ultimate decision maker. Likewise, e dey inconceivable say anybody go ever agree to one contract way go allow person protector to make only am determine, without d consent of person way dem dey protect, d amount way d person way dem dey protect go pay for d protection.

Orthodox, as in, people way sabi politics wella (statist, political theorists, from John Locke go James Buchanan and John Rawls, don try make dem solve dis difficulty through changy changy (makeshift) "tacit" (dem do am for silent), "implicit" (e dey indirect), or "conceptual" agreements, contracts, or state constitutions. All dem dese characteristically tortuose (cony cony) and attempts way dey confusing, however, done only add to d same unavoidable conclusion way Rothbard draw: Say e dey impossible to get justification for government from explicit contracts way dey between private property owners, and hence, say dem d institutions of d state must dey considered as unjust, mean say, na d result of moral error.
