### From Deposit and Loan Banking to Small Reserve Banking: De Fall of Credit

Banks dey do two different konk task, and na only one we don dey talk since.[^20] One tin dem dey do be say, na wia people dey put dia money, dem dey guard dey clear service for people. Dem dey collect deposit of (commodity) money and dey give identity to money (warehouse receipts; oda type of money) to people wey dey put money dia, dem fit collect am equal and if dem ask for am. All de evidence of money dem give person dem dey hold de same amount of money for dia hand, and person fit collect am back (100 percent reserve banking). Dem no dey put extra money for deposit. But people wey dey deposit dey pay money for de security and clearing service bank dey give dem. For condition for free competition- to de enta bank industry free- de deposit fee, wey makeup de bank gain and how dem take dey get money, em dey be small fee; and de gain- or self, interest dem collect- wey dem gain for bank na de same wit oda one, wey nor concern banking industry.

For de oda hand, em dey very different from oda company dem dey deposit, bank be like middlemen between people wey dey save and wey dey invest- like loan banks. For dis kind function dem dey first offer and enta time-contracts wit people wey dey save. People wey dey save dey loan bank money for short or long time to take exchange for de bank’ wetin dey talk for de contract to repay de money for front wit interest on top. From de way people wey dey save money dey see am, dem dey exchange money for de promise of de future own: de interest form part of dia gain to dey wait. As dem don get de temporary ownership of de savings from people wey dey save, bank go den reloan de same money to people wey dey invest (even demself) take exchange to pay de money back for future wit interest. De difference for de interest- de difference wey dey for de interest for people wey dey save and de ones wey dey borrow- dey show dey price wey dey between doz wey dey save and de ones wey dey invest and em form part of de gain bank dey make from loan. As em concern deposit banking and deposit fee, unda dia competition de amount inbetween dey be small cost, and de gain from loan banking go also be de same as de one dem gain from anoda place.

Nor be deposit banking nor be loan banking as dem put am for here show say if dem increase money supply or income for one side or share de wealth. For every new deposit note dem issue dem dey take equal amount comot for circulation (na only de form of money dey change, nor be em size), and as dem do loan banking de same total money dey change hand dey repeat. All de exchange- wey dey between dos wey deposit and depositing institution as well dos wey dey save, de main bank and dos wey invest- dey both get advantage.

Against, fractional reserve banking wey involve deliberate confusion wey dey de deposit and de loan role. Em show say em dem increase money supply, and em lead to dey share de gain for one side favour bank con join economic slack for form of boom-bust business cycles.

De confusion of both de banking role come to light for de fact say unda fractiotional reserve banking, or dos wey dey deposit dey collect interest (rada dan go pay one fee), and dos wey dey save dey get right to witdraw instantly (rada dan to dey wait wit dia request to reclaim until em reach one certain time for future). Technically, de possibility for bank to dey engage for dos kind practice dey happen base on say dos wey dey hold demand deposits (evidence to money wey dem dey get on demand, quick, and equal) commonly *nor* show dia right de same time. Normally, deposit bank go normally hold de amount of reserve (money main main) for excess of de main daily withdrawal. Em con dey possible for de bank to dey loan dis “too much* reserves to dos wey dey borrow, den dey earn de bank interest back (wey de bank go den partially pass to dos wey dey deposit for from of interest paying deposit accounts).

People wey dey support fractional reserve banking dey always claim say dis practice wey dem dey hold wetin less dan 100 percent reserve show say na ordinary good money “to dey economize,” and dem dey always dey fond to talk say nor be only de bank, but people wey dey deposit (dey receive interest) and dos wey dey save (dey receive instant withdrawal right shaperly) gain from de way dem dey do am. In short, fractional reserve banking dey suffer from two big mistake wey connect and em no bad but get big benefit. First be say, make em dey say anytin wey dey less dan 100 percent reserve banking dey involve wetin persin fit call legal impossibility, but to dey employ em too much reserve to dey grant credit, de bank dey normally transfer temporary ownership of dem to some wey dey borrow, although, dos wey deposit, get right to quick claim, to get back dia ownership ova de same funds. Even so, em dey hard say for some time dos wey dey deposit *and* dos wey dey borrow get special control ova de same resource. Two people *nor fit be* de special owner of one tin and de same tin for de same time. Normally, any bank wey dey do anyhow- to dey reason demand debt wey pass actual resrve- den go see am as fraud. Em contract right *nor fit dey* fulfilled. From de start, dem go reason de bank as wetin dey deeply bankrupt- as em show say em nor fit, against em own assumption, fit hold possible bank run.

Second, to dey lend dia excess reserves to borrowers, de bank dey increase de supply of de money, no matter weda de borrower receive de reserves wey be like normal money or say na like demand deposit (checking accounts). If de loan be like normal money, den de amount of normal money wey dey circulate go increase witout say dem witdraw de same amount of oda type of money from circulation; and if em con be checking account, den de amount of oda type of money go increase witout say den comot de same amount of normal money from circulation.  For any of de case, money go money now pass before, em go con cause de purchase power of money to reduce (inflation) and, for dis tin, to one pattern dem go distribute dia real gain take favour de bank and de people wey dey borrow wey be say na people wey no dey use bank and oda bank customers em go affect. De bank dey collect additional gain for interest and em no dey add anytin for de main wealth of dos wey no use bank (as de case go be if de gain dem get come from wen bank reduce how den dey spend,i.e., savings); and dos wey dey borrow get real, property wey no be money and dia funds, go con make am reduce de main wealth of de oda people wit de same amount.

Moreova, as far as say bank no dey simply spend de excess reserve on wetin em dey chop but dey loan dem out opposite to interest charge, everytime dem put business cycle for motion.[^21] De size of credit dem give big pass de one before. As result, de price of credit- de interest dem charge for loans- go fall pass wetin em suppose even be. For price wey low, dem dey collect more credit. Since money nor fit bring more money, make dem take dey earn interest back and legit profit on top of am, de persin wey borrow go need convert de money em borrow take invest. Na to say, dem go need buy or rent tins of production- land, workers, and self capital goods (wey be factors of production em bring)- wey fit produce future result of goods wey em value (price) pass de one wey dem input. Normally, wit increase for volume of de credit, dem go bound de resource wey dey now take produce *future* goods (instead of to dey use de consumption for now) dan em for be; so em for complete all de investtement projects now wey dey, em for need time pass wetin em require to complete only dos ones wey for don start witout say dem increase de credit. All de future goods wey dem for create witout dia expansion take add dos one wey dem add new base on de credit expansion dem must provide am.

Infact, for separate opposite to de matter wey de interest rate fall becos of de fall for choice for time (de extend wey dem like today goods pass future own), and den wen de public don save many make dem for make big fund of goods now dey available to people wey invest take exchange for de ones dem go get back for future, nor get any change for time like and to dey save don happen for de matter we dey consida. De public dem *nor* save more, and normally, de amount of credit dem add wey de bank allow nor dey represent *commodity credit* (de credit wey dey covered by nonmoney goods wey de people don comot dia hand to dey consume), but na *trustee* or *credit wey circulate* (credit wey jux come out from wia dem no know- witout say dem work for am, wey be like dem no chop nonmoney goods, for de part of de creditor).[^22] To say de credit dem add be commodity credit, de need to increase de size of de investment activities for dey dia. Em for dey enough big supply for goods wey dey now wey dem go put take produce future goods wey be say- de old one like de new one go start- investment project wey dem fit jejely complete and future eating for dey guaranteed. If de way de credit dey big na becos of to dey grant circulation credit, even self, de ensuing size of de investement go really show extra ambition. Misled am wit small interest rate, dos wey invest dey do *like say* savings don high. Dem witdraw many of de present resource wey dey for dia investment project, to take convert am for future to capital goods, dan say dem give am for actual savings. Even like dat, capital goods dia price go increase first compare to consumer goods dia price, but once say de public mind for time preference begin to dey show em self, one kind pattern of shortage for consumer goods go happen. Normally, de interest rate go jux go up, and na consumer dia goods price go con increase compare to de capital goods dia price, em go require say dem liquidate part of de investment like unsustainable malinvestment. De early boom go turn bust, em go con reduce de future standard of living pass de de level wey em for no reach.

Among current people wey dey support fractional reserve banking de case of Lawrence White and George Selgin[^23] derserve some kind yabbing, if no be for any reason dan say de two of dem dey yab Friedmanite monetarism who hear back, instead, for de tradition of Austrian and for particular Misesian monetary theory.[^24] Dia monetary standard na world commodity money like international gold standard and, base on dis, system of competitive banking wey, dem claim, go- and suppose permit to do am for wetin concern economic good and justice- put hand for fractional reserve banking and to dey give fudiciary credit.

As em concern justice matter, White and Selgin jux put one argument wey show de allegedly nonfraudulent character of fractional reserves: to comot dat kind practice go follow breach de principle wey concern freedom of contract to stop “bank and dia customer to dey make any kind contract arrangement wey dem two gree.”[^25] even self dis one nay eye argument. First, say as em concern history fractional reserve bank neva tell dos wey dey deposit say some or all of dia deposit go dey loaned out and em no fit ready to collect for any time. (Even say de bank dem pay interest for deposit account, and den em *suppose* dey clear say de bank *go* loan out deposits, dis one no show say anybody wey dey deposit undastand de fact. Infact, em dey safe to talk if few or any at all, even people wey no sabi economics.) Fractional reserve banks nor even tell people wey dey borrow say all de credits dem dey give na from thin air and dem fit recall am at any time. How, de, dem fit call wetin dem dey do fraud and embezzlement!

Second, and more direct, to dey believe say fractitional reserve banking dem go see am to dey fall under and get protection from principle of freedom of contract show total misundastanding of de main meaning of de principle. Freedom of contract no show say *all* common legit contract dem suppose allow am. Normally, if A and B join agree make dem rob C, dis one no jux follow de principle. Freedom of contract mean say instead make dem let A and B do any contract *wey concern dia own property*, yet fractional reserve banking na to dey don contract wey concer property of third parties. Anytime bank loan em “excess” reserve to who dey borrow, dat kind bilateral contract dey affect de property of third parties for three way. First, na by to dey increase de money supply, de level people wey get money dey buy go con reduce; second na say, people wey dey deposit dey hear word because de means make dem for take get dia belongings back go dey low; de third be say, people wey dey borrow- wey dey borrow commodity credit- em go affect dem becos dem put fiduciary credit em dey affect de safety of de whole credit pattern and dey increase de risk of say de business go fail for people wey dey invest for commodity credit.

In order say dem overcome dis disagreement to de claim say fractiotional reserve banking dey in line wit de principle wey concern freedom of contract, White and Selgin den, as dia last line to defense, witdraw wetin dem yarn before say banks go put “option clause” to dia notes, dey con tell people wey dey deposit say bank fit from anytime stop dia claim, dem still let people wey dey borrow know say dem fit pay dia loan back sharperly.[^26] Wey be say dis kind tin go stop matter like fraud, em con still get wetin dem go take yab am, dat kind note no go con be *money* but con be one kind *lottery tickets*.[^27] Na de function of money to dey be wetin dem fit sell again and most common goods dem dey accept, make em take prepare de owner to sharperly buy direct or indirect important consumer or producer goods for later later for future, em go be sometin wey show *absolute* and *unconditional* property right on em owner. Against dis tin, de person wey get de note wey dem for put de option clause *nor* get unconditional property title. Rada, resemble  person wey hold “fractional reserve parking ticket” (wia dem dey sell many ticket pass wia dem dey park, and dem dey do am base on “first-come_firstserved” rule), em dey entitled to participate to dey collect some prize, wey include ownership or time-rental services to some kind goods base on some kind rules. But na drawing right- nor be unconditional ownership titles- dem only get *short time condition* value until em reach time for de draw, and dem no go get value again as sharp as dem give de prize to dem wey hold tickets; den, dem go dey one kind *un*suited to use am take dey exchange.

As em concern de second issue: say fractiotional reserve banking dey economically good, em dey important to show say White, although em dey undoubtedly familiar wit de Austrian-Misesian claim say *any* injection of fiduciary credit go result for boom-bust cycle, no wia dem mention de proble wey concern business cycles. Only Selgin address de problem. For em attempt to show say fractional reserve banking no dey cause business cycles, infact, Selgin con fall headlong for de fundamental Keynesian error to dey confuse de demand for money (fit get from de use of money) and savings (fit cause by time choice).[^28]

According to Selgin, “to hold money inside money na to engage for free saving”; and normally “increase for demand for money fit cause increase for bank loans and investment” becos

> [a]nytime bank wan expand em liabilities for de process to dey make new loan and investment, na de holder of de liability wey be de ultimate lender for credit, and wetin dem dey lend na de main resource dem fit get if, instead dem hold money, dem go spend am.[^29]

Base on dis view of holding money say em be saving and de increase for de demand for money like say na de same tin wit increase for saving, den, Selgin con go yab Mises claim say *any* issuance of fiduciary media, to dey low em interest rate below em “natural” level, go cause business cycle dey “confused.” No bad result dey come from to dey issue fiduciary media take react to big demand for balance wey dey inside money.”[^30]

Yet de confusion all na Selgin own. First say, na lie to say to dey hold money (say you no dey spend am), dey equal to dey save am. Person fit still talk say- dis one still dey wrong- say person nor dey spend money em dey equal to say de person nor dey save. De demand for money na de mind nor dey to dey buy or rent nonmoney goods, and dis one join consumer goods (present goods) *and capital goods (future goods). Nor dey spend money na to dey buy *nor be* even consumer goods *nor* be investment goods. Against Selgin talk, den de matter dey like dis: People fit put dia money monetary assets for one of de three ways. Dem fit spend am for consumer goods; dem fit spend am for investment; or dem fit keep am for de form of cash. Anoda alternative nor dey again. Wey be say person must always dey make decision as em concern three margin at once, everytime de result dey determined by two separate praxeologically unrelated factors. De consumption/investment level (de decision of how much of person spend em money for consumption and investment) dey determined by em time predference (de extend wey em like present consumption pass future consumption). For de other hand, de source of em demand for money na de use attach to de money (de personal satisfaction em get from de money to allow am sahrperly buy tins directly abi indirectly serviceable consumer or producer goods for one kind time for future).

Normally, if de demand for money increase wen dem give de social stock of money, dem fit only satisfy dis additional demand if dem dey bid down de price of nonmoney goods. De purchasing power of money go increase, de *real* value of personal cash balance go increase, and na for bigger purchasing power per unit of money, de demand and supply for money go con balance. De relative price of money versus nonmoney go don change. But unless say time choice dem assume am say em don change at de same time, *real* consumption and *real* investment go remain de same as em dey before: de additional money demand dey satisfied by to dey reduce nominal consumption *and* investment spending as em dey in line wit de same, former consumption/investment proportion, go dey drag de price of both consumer and producer goods go down and em go leave real consumption and investment for dia normal old level. If dem assume time choice to dey change de same time wit de way demand dey increase for money, even self, den everything dey possible. Infact, if dem reduce spending normally for investment goods, increase for money go even go hand in hand wit de increase for de rate of interest and go reduce saving and investment. Howeva, dis, or de equal possible opposite result, nor go be becos of de change for demand for money but na mainly for change (rise or em fall) for de time choice schedule. For any case, if dem allow de banking system make em follow Selgin advice and make em join de increase for demand for money by to dey give fiduciary credit, de social rate for time choice dem go forge am, too much investment go happen, and boom-bust cycle go con dey, go con make de practice of fractional reserve banking dey fraudulent *and like say* economically nor good.

White and Selgin proposal for commodity money base system of competitive fractional reserve banking- of small paper money- nor jux be (even self de term “free banking” nor dey appropriate), nor be say em dey provide economic stability. Em no be any fundamental improvement if you compare am to monetarist reality of monopolistically issue pure paper money.infact, for one side Friedman pure paper money proposal contain many real and correct analysis pass White and Selgin becos say Friedman recognize “wetin dem dey call ‘de inside wahala’ of fractional reserve banking,” and em undastand say dis ‘inside wahala’ of fractional reserve banking go soon or later collapse for “liquidity crisis” and fit lead to em favor regime- government dey provide paper money-anyhow.[^31]

Only for system of world commodity money (gold), competitive banks, *and* 100-percent-reserve deposit banking join strict functional separation of loan and deposit banking still join normal monetary system wey fit assure economic good and show better answer to de main currency wahala.
