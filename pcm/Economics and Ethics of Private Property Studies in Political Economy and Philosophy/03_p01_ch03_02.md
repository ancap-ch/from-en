### De State and De Monopolization of Money and Banking

De economic order wey dey now get characteristic of national money dem instead of one universal money, of fiat money instead of commodity like gold, of monopolistic central banking instead of free banking; and of  bank fraud wey dey permanent, and steady income and wealth redistribution, inflation wey dey permanent and business cycle wey dey happen again and again as im economic counterpart dem, instead of 100-percent-reserve banking wey no one of dis consequences go show.

For big time contradiction, den, for no man sef-interest to use economic integration maximize im wealth, different anti-economic interest wey dey win economic interest must to dey responsible for de emergence of de monetary order dem we dey now.

Person fit get and increase wealth by homesteading, to produce and by, or contractual exchange, or to collecf homesteaders, producers or contractual exchangers dia property by force. E no get anoda way. De two ways dey natural to man pikin. togeda with some interest inside producing and contracting, interest to get nonproductive and contractual property and wealth don always dey. And for inside de course of exonomic development, de same way wey de former interest fit lead to de formation of productive enterpise firm dem plus including corporations, na so de latter one go fit lead to largescale enterprse dem, come bring government dem or states to standa.[^9]

De size and growth of a productive enterprise dey constrained for one hand by voluntary consumer demand, and for de oda hand by de competition of oda producers dat continuously forces each firm to dey operate with de lowest possible costs if e wishes to stay for business. For dat kind enterprise to grow in size, de most urgent consumer wants must be served first in de most efficient ways. Nothing but voluntary consumer purchases support its size.

The constraints on de oda type of institution—de state—are altogether different.[^10] For one thing, e dey obviously absurd to talk say e own emergence and growth dey determined by demand for de same sense as an economic firm. Person nor fit talk say by any stretch of de imagination say de homesteaders, de producers and de contractual exchangers who go must surrender (part of) dia assets to a state don eva demand dat kind service. Instead, dem dey force dem to go accept am, and dis na conclusive proof of de fact say de service nor even dey in demand at all. For de oda hand, de state dey also nor constrained for same way by competition like a productive firm. For unlike such a firm, de state nor go keep e own costs of operation for a minimum, but fit operate at above-minimum costs, becos e dey able to shift e higher costs ontop e competitors by taxing or regulating dia behavior. As far say de state don come out, den, e dey do so in spite of de fact say e nor even dey in demand or dey efficient.

Instead of make dem use cost and demand conditions, de way wey exploiting furm dey grow, na public opinion dey constrain am: E require force to get nonproductive and noncontractual property, and victim go always dey wen dem use force. E dey noticeable say for dey break resistance wen e concern one man (or one group of me) wey dey exploit one or maybe two or three oda men (or one group wey be almost de same size). E dey noticeable, howeva,  to imagine say force alone fit account for de break down of resistance for case wey det familiar, of small minority dem wey dey use force collect things wey  ten, hundred or thousand of dia size. for dis one to happen one firm must to get public support add to coercive force. majority of de people must accept sey im operation legit. Dis acceptance must to range from active enthusiasm to passive resignation. Howeva, acceptance e must  happen say majority must to don give up de idea of actively or passively resisting any attempt get nonproductive and noncontractual property by force. Instead of to display vex for dat kind action, of to show contempt for every person wey follow inside, and of to do anytin wey go help dem dey successful (make we nor mention, to try to obstruct dem), one majority must support dem actively or passively. de opinion of public wey dey support state must to counterbalance de resistance of property owner dem wey fall victim so dat active resistance go appear as wetin nor dey important. And goal wey de state get and  de goal of de people wey de state employ wey want to contribute to secure and improve dia own position inside  de state, must be de one wey dey maximize wealth incom wey dem use force get, by to produce public opinion and to create legitimacy wey dey favourable.

Na only two complementary measure wey dey available for de state wey dey try to accomplish dis one. For one hand, na Ideological propaganda wey dey. na much time and effort wey dem dey spend to convince de public sey things no dey as we see am: Exploitation na freedom true true, taxes na by choice: noncontractual relations na really “conceptually” contractual ones dem be; [^11] No body dey rule anybody, na we de rule we sef; without de state law or security nor go dey; and poor people go perish and so on.

For de oda hand, redistribution dey. Instead of make people be ordinary parasite consumer of good dem wey oda people don make, de state dey redistribute some of im coercively appropriated wealth give people wey nor follow for de state apparatus and dat way e dey try to corrupt dis people to assume some roles wey dey support de state.

But nor be any kind redistribution go dey ok. Just as idea dem must to serve —statist—purpose, so na redistribution must do. Redistribution nid cost-expenditure and so e need justification. E nor dey undertaken by de state just to do wetin nice for some peoole, just as, wen person give anoda person gift. or weda dem do am just to gain high income  from exchange dem, just as wen ordinary  economic business carry body enter trade. dem do am to make sure say dem fit continue to use force collect property. Redistribution must to serve dis strategic purpose. Im cost dem must to dey justified for de terma of increase state income and wealth. De political entrepreneurs dem wey dey in charge of de state apoaratus go fit do mistake for dis task, just like ordinary businessmen, cos dem must make dia decision on top which redistributive measure go serve dis purpose wella as dem dey expect dia result.  And if entrepreneurial mistake happen, de state income fit to fall instead of to rise, e fit even spoil im own exstence. Na de very work of state politics and de work of political entrepreneurship to avoid situation dem like dat and to choose policy wey go increase state income.

While we nor go fit predict de particular form of redistributive policy dem or dia particular outcome dem, but instead dem fit change with changing circumstances, de natur of de state go still require say im redistributive policy must follow one particular order and e go display one type of structural regularity. [^12]

As one firm carry body join for de maximisation  of exploitatively appropriated wealth, de first place wey  de state go apply redistributiv measures na production of securiry, as in, of police, defense and judicial system. De state go dey depend on force and so e nor go fit do without armes forces. Any armed forces wey dey compete—wey go naturally come out for de market so dat e go fit satisfy genuine demand for security and protection service dem— na threat to im  existence and dem must eliminate am sharp-sharp. To do dis one na to claim de job for im sef, come become de only supplier and redestributor of protection service dem for one define territory. Na de same way wey, judicial system wey dey compete go tanda as immediate threat to one state as e claim say im dey legit. And again, for de sake of im own existence de judicial system must to dey monopolized and dem must carry legal services join im body for dem redistributive scheme.

De nature of de state as institution wey carry body join organized aggression dey also explain de importance of de next field of redistributive activities: de one of traffic and communication. regular exploitation nor fit happen without monopolistic control of river dem, coast, seaways, streets, rail way, airport, mail, and telecommunication system. And so dis thing dem must to become de object of redistribution.

De field of education get de same importance. Just as  public opinion be for de mata and im acceptance of de state dia action as wetin legit,  e dey essential for one state to elimate  ideological competition wey nor favour dem as far as possible and statist ideas dem don spread. De atempt wey de state don make to accomplish dis one as e provide educational services for redistributive basis.

As de system of state education further am, de next important area for redistribution na de area wey dem redistribute state power im sef, as in, de right wey de state get to use force and to redistribute nonproductively appropriated asset dem. Instead of to remain institution wey dey restrict people to enter am and/or  some kind government position, state, for some strategic reason wey we know, dey adopt organizational structure wey in principle dey open up all position to everyman, and e dey grant equal and universal rights of participation and competition for de determination of state policy. Every man— nor be just privileged big men— dey recieve legal stake for de state so dat e go fit reduce de resistance to state power. [^13]

As dem monopolize law and security production, traffic, communication and education, and even as dem democratize state rule im sef, dem don identify all de features dem of modern state, but one remain: As de state monopolize money and banking. dem don breifly explain every remain dis one, how we go fit understand dem as performing strategic function dem: Why and how dem nor be normal productive contribution, wey demand and supply forces or good deeds go fir determine, but redistributive activity dem wey dey serve de purpose of to stabilize and if e dey possible increase de income and wealth wey state use exploit get.

Na de monopolization of money and banking wey be de ultimate pillar wey de modern state dey rest on top. In fact, e don be come de instrument to increase state income wey dem like pass. E nor get any oda place wey de state fit make connection make e dey direct, quick, and secure between redistribution-expenditure and exploitation-return if nor be by to monopolize money and banking. And e nor get any oda place wey de state scheme go less clearly  understood pass here.

To prefer like every man, income wey high or low, but unlike oda people e dey for de business of to get nonproductive and noncontractual property, de state position wey regard money and bank dey clear make we see: na pure fiat money wey de state dey control monopolistically dey help im objective dem. Na only dat time wey de barrier wey dey block counterfeiting dey drop (wen de whole monetary system break down cos of hyperinflation) and de state go fit increase im own income and wealth by anoda person expense without cost and without de fear say money go finish.[^14]

Howeva things wey block road dey for se road to use get dis state of affairs wey every man dey eye. for de oda hand, we nor fit change de fact say money fit only come out as commodity. (e nor dey possible to start with fiat money). [^15] for de oda hand, we go find de problem of say de money wey person fit use counterfeit get nor too plenty pass de money taxation go give, e don be measure wey bank must notice, especially wen e dey happen everytime. And so e nor dey possible for de state to escape with institutionalized counterfeiting unless e go fit carry boy join redistributive measures wey dey capable to bring anoda change wey favour public dia opinion. Dis problem and de natural desire of de state na dem determine how de state go act.

Becos of wetin dey happen for de free market, de state dey see gold as money and system of free banking. Im goals na to destroy dis system and to remove all de things wey dey block counterfeiting with am. Technically (as e dey ignore say dis thing  hard psychological ), den im go dictate de steps wey dem go take to accomplish dis objective: For de first step de minting of gold must to dey monopolized by de state. Dis one dey serve de purpose of psychologically denationalizing gold the how dem shift de emphasis from gold denominated for universal terms of weight to gold as denominated for terma of fiat labels. And e remove de first import block wey dey hindee counterfeiting cos e dey give d state de main institutional way to enrich im sef through systematic process of currency debasement.

[^9]: As e nor blend with de claim of  public choice school, states and private firms dem nor dey do de same type of business, but instead dem don carey body join different type of operation. Both type of institution na de outcome of different, antagonistic interest. De “political” interest wey dey inside exploitation, wey dey under de formation of states dey obviously nid and e presuppose de existence of wealth, and na why at least one person get de “economic” interest  to produce dat kind wealth for de first place (while de reverse fit nor be true). But for de same time, de way wey dem talk about political interest  and  de way wey e dey successful na de same way wey destructive of economic interest go be. De public choice school dey correct wen e point out sey everybody—a government employee na de same with economic firm employee— dey normally prefer high to low income and sey dis interest dey explain why government suppose get  nothing less pass de tendency to grow pass abg oda enterprise.

::::Howeva, dis discovery— say politicians and bureaucrats nor dey more inclined to help people or nor get concern for de good of de public pass people for oda walks of life— e nor dey new even if dem don ovalook am sometimes. Yet, in fact wetin dey new with public choice na de conclusion we dem draw from dus correct idea, say all institution dem must to dey regarded as wetin grow from identical motivational force and dem must treat am analytically for de same level with each oda—nor be trye to de point wey e fit make you laugh. E nor concern de subjective belief wey person get, to put im action inside institutional framework of weda na de state or “normal” economic enterprise nd to pursue de interest wey im get to expand im wealth here or there go true true produce different outcome dem.
