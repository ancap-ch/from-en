### De Positive Economics of Fiduciary Media: Money Balance, Price, Adjustment, Saving, and Investment

From de way de nature of fiduciary media be- as title to money property (gold) wey nor dey exist, title wey dem give money wey oda things wey no be money don cover, or plain fake money- e go be like say fractional reserve banking nor dey affect am as na continuous wealth and income dey reshuffle. As substitute for de money wey dem recover  dey come from the issuing bank and de customers wey be borrowers outside of the economy, and e go come raise de price even more of de goods, real money (property) go dey transferred and redistributed wey go favor de bank wey dey issue and de first receivers of money dem and sellers . Rothbard explain say,

> De people wey receive the money first na im go gain de most, de next go gain small put, etc., sotey de middle go come reach, and from dere every person wey dey receive go dey lose more and more as e dey wait for new money. For de person wey come first selling price go run up while buying price go remain almost where e stand put; but later, buying prices go don rise while selling price nor go don change.[^28]

According to wetin Selgin and White don talk, sha, fiduciary media fit achieve far more. Instead of to dey only redistribute property wey dey, de matter wey concern fiduciary media fit , under some kind level, e fit lead to increase for real money (property). We don already quote them wehen they talk say “benefits wey bank borrowers go get who dey enjoy steady supply of intermediate credit, and for everybody wey dey work with the bigger stock of capital equipment wey dey de economy as time dey go.” Dem dodge to put am like dis make e dey clear,yet wetin dem dey claim na say, under specific parol, increase for title for fund wey never change for goods go make the fund grow or go stop am to reduce.

Wen and how dat kind miracle wan take happen? According to wetin Selgin and White talk, (unexpected) change for the demand for money go lead to “temporary” or “short-run monetary disequilibrum” wey go involve “serious misallocation of resources”- dat na, *unless* dat kind change fall put for fractional reserve banking practices. Dem yarn say:

> For de long run, nominal price go take dressing to equal supply and demand for money to balance, no matter de amount of nominal money wey dey. E nor follow, sha, say each and every *change* for de supply or demand for money go lead *sharparly* to new long-run equilibrium, because the price adjustment wey we dey expect go take time. Dem dey take time because nor be all agents dey aware instantly and perfectly for change wey don happen for de money wey dey stock or money demand, and because e go cost to increase some price and therefore “sticky”. E follow say, for the short time (by observation,reason “for some months”), less dan the change wey we dey expect for the supply of or demand for money fit lead to monetary disequilibrum….Na for dat reason e come become attractive feature for free banking wey get fractional reserves wey the nominal amount of bank-issued money dey be like e wan adjust so as to clear changes for the movement of money.[^29]
> 
> If de banking system come fail to increase the amount of money wey dem issue and the price level no con drop sharparly, na excess demand for money go happen (assuming say amount of base money too no increase sharp sharp). E go make excess supply of goods rise : consumer goods wey dem neva sell go pile up for sellers dem shelves (this of course go put downward pressure for price until last last goods proce go don fall enough). Business go dey low key until de power of money to buy con rise back to where e bin dey.[^30]

From de beginning, person gats wonder about the fact say d problem about monetary disequilibrum dey(not to talk of the solution). For the quote wey ah just throw, person fit put any goods in place of money: televisions, steel, beer, or pretzels. The amount of goods like this ones dey fixed one kind (so also the quantity of gold), and yet (unexepected) change for the demand for televisions, steel, beer, or pretzels no dey lead to temporary disequilibria wey involve serious misdividing of resources. Or, for any way, dey no dey cause gbenge wey go require make dem bring special new device ( like fractional television or beer production).

E no even still clear why we suppose believe say “e dey important to dey divide between short-run and long-run effect of changes for the demand schedule for money or wey dey the stock of money.”[^31] or, for any matter, why e be say the difference suppose dey of different importance or value in the case wey involve money from one wey concern any other thing. To dey sure, e dey take time before increase wey no dey expected for increase for the demand for television and beer, for example, go don finish all e effect for the system for relative process and one new adjustment production structure go don dey established. But this no mean say price adjustment dey take time (wey go dey cause short-run gbenge). But opposite, price adjustment go happen immediately and no go waste time. This fact don dey overlooked because of un-Austrian concern for macroeconomic artifacts like de general price level, long-run equilibrium, and the wey money dey waka. Sha, when we look am from correct individualist angle, doubt no go dey regarding the fact say proce adjustment dey happen instant plus to consider de human involvement of de short and de long run.

For individualistic term, increase for de demand for money na de result of the action of individuals wey don do on purpose; that is, people mind for increasing their own cash balance. To do am, person gats reduce the buying wey im dey do and/or increase e sales. For either side, de result na immediate fall for some of the prices.  As e be say person don reduce e buy buy of x,y,z, de money price of x,y,z go come reduce instant (compared to wetin for happen for the other case), and same way, if person reduce e  sales of a, b, or c, their price go fall instant. Nobody dey worry about the general proce level or de generalized ability of money to fit buy. Instead, everybody dey reason the specific prices and the power wey money get regarding some special items (and everybody dey interested on e own and different special range wey price get and e power to buy). As e limit e specific buy buy and/or say he increase he specific sales, each person wey dey involved go achieve exactly and instanta wetin e want: so kind price wey e be like e too high go dey reduced, de power of  a unit money to buy go increase, de real value of e cash balance go rise, and e demand and supply of money go come back to equilibrium instanta (and e no wan hold either more or less money dan wetin e actually get) .[^32]

The adjustment of the praxeologically meaningless general price level wey come as a result of increase for demand for money na nothing but de addition of series of of immediate and purposeful individual cash-balance adjustments wey we no fit count. If de increase for de demand for money dey followed by the issue of fiduciary media, as Selgin and White don support dis adjustment process no go get support but go dey delayed.[^33] De speed wey de price go take adjust dey depend on the wetin de market-participants dey expect concerning dat quantity of  money wey don knack ground. If e make sense to think say fractional reserve banks go increase their fiduciary issues to response to unexpected increase for de demand for money, den de adjustment go take *more* time. Production go adjust and go start *earlier* without say inflation influence join. [^34]

By de way, de solution wey dem don put for ground wey go handle de problem as dem say of short-run monetary disequilibrum go  show basic confusion wey concern de concept of demand (and supply), and de way demand for money, saving, and investment in particular dey related. First, increase for demand for money (as for televisions, beer, or pretzels) no be just a wish to get more money (or televisions, beer, etc.), but *effective* demand. Dat na, increased demand for money (as for anything else) go fit dey satisfied only if de demander dey willing to increase e market-supply of and/or reduce his demand for anoda thing. So also, the supplier (seller) of money go fit only increase e supply of money if he reduces the same time, de supply of (or e reservation demand for) anoda thing. De authors don overlook Say’s law: all goods (property) dey bought with oda goods, nobody fit  demand anything without supplying another thing, and nobody fit demand or supply more of anytin unless he go demands or supplies small of something else. Through the issue and sale of fiduciary media, wishes don dey accepted, not effective demand. Property don dey appropriated (effectively demanded) without say he supply oda property as exchange. So, dis nor be market exchange—which dey governed by Say’s law—but na act of undue appropriation. Or e go be a good solution to de kasala of unexpected  short-run television, beer, or pretzel-shortages if television, beer, and pretzel producers for try allow dat kind increased demand “temporarily” by say you dey give and sell additional titles give televisions, beer, and pretzels but nor be dis goods themselves?

Second, Selgin and White come go ahead to bullshit the nature wey money get and de demand for money wey dey hand to even talk de big one say the issue of fiduciary media “*wey dey matched with increased demand to hold fiduciary media*” nor dey only disequilibrating, but go actually make de economy get “larger stock of capital equipment,” sake of say

> [t]he parol to hold fractional-reserve *bank-issued* money nor go only (like as person dey hold base money) put down consumption for longer or shorter period,  but go also *temporarily lends funds* to de bank wey issue am as e dey go on. De period wey de loan go last no dey known…but if de bank fit estimate with small correctness de amount of time wey de demand claims go dey go round…e fit do proper investments of corresponding length.[^35]

As e dey follow de lead wey Rothbard don set, Hoppe come dey  talk down this important Keynesian view wey concern de relationship wey dey between demand for money and savings (loanable funds)[^36] by pointing out say

> To nor spend money na to buy *neither* consumer goods *nor* investment goods… People  fit use their monetary property for one of dis three ways. Dem fit spend am on consumer goods; dem fit spend am on investment; or dem fit keep am as cash. No oda way dey…De consumption/investment proportion i.e., decision on wetin to spend and how much to invest, dey determined by person own choice of time;i.e., de extent to which e prefer to consume  now against to consume for future. For de oda side, de origin of e demand for cash na wetin e wan use the money for;i.e., the joy wey e derive from money dey allow am instant buying of directly or indirectly serviceable consumer or producer goods for future date wey e never know.
> 
> As e be like dat, if de demand for money come increase while de social stock of money don comot hand, de additional demand go fit dey satisfied by only say dem bid down de money price for goods wey nor involve money. De power wey money get to buy go increase, de *real* value wey individual cash get  go rise, and for higher power wey money come get to buy per unit money, de demand for and de supply of money go once again dey equal. De relative price wey money get versus non-money go don change. But *unless* we come assume say time preference don change for dat same time, *real* consumption and *real* investment go remain de same like before: de additional money demand go dey satisfied if e reduce nominal consumption *and* investment wey e dey spend according to de former consumption/investment ratio wey dey before, e go drive de money prices of both consumer and even producer goods down wey go con leave real consumption and investment for exactly where dem dey before.[^37]

As e be like that, Hoppe come conclude say, e *never* dey warranted to accept increased demand for money by giving out fiduciary credit.[^38]. In fact, to do like dat go either- so long as de increase of fiduciary media wey we don accept dey unexpected and de market rate of interest come fall temporarily below de normal level of interest- go lead to boom-bust cycle; or else- so long as de change for money level wey dey come from de bank dey expected and de market rate of interest come dey built up (as we dey expect higher selling prices) to follow de height wey de natural rate don set- e go see notin wey pass common wealth and income redistribution among de different members of de society. E sha dey humanly impossible, say, de issue of fiduciary media fit lead to “enlarged stock of capital equipment.”

[^30]: Ibid., p. 105\. As Roger Garrison, another fractional reserve free banker, has put it, “in terms of the equation of exchange [MV=PQ], we can say that free banking adjusts M so as to offset changes in V; but allows changes in Q to be accommodated by changes in P.” Garrison describes the short-run “monetary disequilibrium” in almost identical form:

> An increase in the demand for money puts downward pressure on product and factor prices in general. If there were no money-supply response, a general decline in economic activity would follow, since prices and wages could not fully and instantaneously adjust themselves to the new market conditions. Goods in general would go unsold; production would be cut; workers would be laid off…. With a less-than-perfectly flexible price system, general deflationary pressures can push the economy below its potential during the period in which prices are adjusting to the higher monetary demand. And the fact that some prices and some wages are more flexible than others means that the adjustment period will involve changes in relative prices that reflect no changes in relative scarcities. These are precisely the kinds of problems … avoided by free banking’s responsiveness to increases in money demand. (“Central Banking, Free Banking, and Financial Crises,” *Review of Austrian Economics* 9, no. 2 [1996]: 117)

[^32]: Thus writes Mises:

> Buyers and sellers on the market never concern themselves with the elements in the equation of exchange, of which two—velocity of circulation and the price level—do not even exist before market parties act and the other two—the quantity of money (in the whole economy) and the sum of transactions—could not possibly be known to the parties in the market. Only the importance which the various actors in the market attach, on the one hand, to the maintenance of a cash balance of a certain magnitude and, on the other hand, to the ownership of the various goods in question determines the formation of the exchange relationship between money and goods. (“The Position of Money Among Economic Goods,” in *Money, Method, and the Market Process*, Richard Ebeling, ed. [Boston: Kluwer, 1990], p. 61)

[^33]: Moreover, from an individualist perspective, the increased demand for money occurs with specific actors at specific times and places. It is not sufficient for banks to accommodate some abstract higher money demand by more money; rather, but the accommodation would have to occur precisely with the correct people and locations. If this is not the case, one can hardly speak of an accommodation but of an additional distortion. This difficulty was recognized by the early Hayek:

> in order to eliminate all monetary influences on the formation of prices, and the structure of production, it would not be sufficient merely quantitatively to adapt the supply of money to these changes in demand, it would be necessary also to see that it came into the hands of those who actually require it; that is, to that part of the system where that change in business organization or the habits of payment had taken place. (*Prices and Production* [London: Routledge, 1935], p. 124)

With the later Hayek, one wonders how banks could possibly have the requisite knowledge of performing this task.

[^34]: As regards the stickiness of prices, and the redistributive consequences of an increased demand for money vis-à-vis an array of prices of varying degrees of stickiness, which Selgin and White as well as Garrison raise as matters of concern, it is of utmost importance to recognize that prices are the outcome of purposive action—and so is their stickiness. That is, the flexibility or inflexibility of various product and service prices is not accidental to, but a deliberate part of, these products and services. Contrary to Garrison’s claim, the stickiness of prices does affect and is related to, real relative scarcities. If more sticky prices suffer more, so to speak, so be it; that will teach them to be less sticky in the future—if the owners of the property in question act in a manner compatible with this end.

[^35]: Selgin and White, “In Defense of Fiduciary Media,” p. 103\. The error of confusing property and titles lies also at the bottom of Selgin and White’s attempts to separate analytically the demand for outside money from the demand for inside money, as if these were somehow two different kinds of money with two different and independent demands.

[^36]: Selgin stated the same thesis thus:

> Whenever a bank expands its liabilities in the process of making new loans and investments, it is the holders of the liabilities who are the ultimate lenders of credit, and what they lend are the real resources they could acquire if, instead of holding money, they spent it. When the expansion or contraction of bank liabilities proceeds in such a way as to be at all times in agreement with changing demands for inside money, the quantity of real capital funds supplied to borrowers by the banks is equal to the quantity voluntarily offered to the banks by the public. Under these conditions, banks are simply intermediaries of loanable funds. (*The Theory of Free Banking: Money Supply under Competitive Note Issue*, p. 55)

As for John Maynard Keynes (*The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money* [New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1936], p. 82), he had written that the notion that the creation of credit by banking systems allows investment to take place to which “no genuine saving” corresponds; that is, “the idea that saving and investment … can differ from one another, is to be explained, I think, by an optical illusion” (p. 81).

> [T]he savings which result from this decision are just as genuine as any other savings. No one can be compelled to own the additional money corresponding to the new bank-credit, unless he deliberately prefers to hold more money rather than some other form of wealth. (p. 83)

Indeed, Selgin acknowledges that

> many Keynesians might accept the prescription for monetary equilibrium offered [by him]. Those who do not regard the liquidity trap as an important factual possibility would probably accept it as entirely adequate. (*The Theory of Free Banking*, p. 59)

Henry Hazlitt remarked on this Keynesian idea that

> [o]n the same reasoning we can create any amount of new “savings” we wish overnight, simply by printing that amount of new paper money, because *somebody* will necessarily hold that new paper money! (*The Failure of the “New Economics”: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies* [Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 1983], p. 227)

As for Selgin and White’s claim of being Misesians, it is worthwhile to quote Mises on

> the role cash holding plays in the process of saving and capital accumulation…. [i]f an individual employs a sum of money not for consumption but for the purchase of factors of production, saving is directly turned into capital accumulation. If the individual saver employs his additional savings for increasing his cash holding because this is in his eyes the most advantageous mode of using them, he brings about a tendency toward a fall in commodity prices and a rise in the monetary unit’s purchasing power. If we assume that the supply of money in the market system does not change, this conduct on the part of the saver will not directly influence the accumulation of capital and its employment for an expansion of production. The effect of our saver’s saving, i.e., the surplus of goods produced over goods consumed, does not disappear on account of his hoarding. The prices of capital goods do not rise to the height they would have attained in the absence of such hoarding. But the fact that more capital goods are available is not affected by the striving of a number of people to increase their cash holdings. If nobody employs the goods—the nonconsumption of which brought about the additional saving—for an expansion of his consumptive spending, they remain as an increment in the amount of capital goods available, whatever their prices may be. The two processes—increased cash holding of some people and increased capital accumulation—take place side by side. A drop in commodity prices, other things being equal, causes a drop in the money equivalent of the various individuals’ capital. But this is not tantamount to a reduction in the supply of capital goods and does not require an adjustment of production activities to an alleged impoverishment. It merely alters the money items to be applied in monetary calculation. (Mises, *Human Action*, pp. 521–22)
