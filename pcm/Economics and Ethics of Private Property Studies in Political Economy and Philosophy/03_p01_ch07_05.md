### De Positive Economics of Fiduciary Media: Money Balance, Price, Adjustment, Saving, and Investment

From de way de nature of fiduciary media be- as title to money property (gold) wey nor dey exist, title wey dem give money wey oda things wey no be money don cover, or plain fake money- e go be like say fractional reserve banking nor dey affect am as na continuous wealth and income dey reshuffle. As substitute for de money wey dem recover  dey come from the issuing bank and de customers wey be borrowers outside of the economy, and e go come raise de price even more of de goods, real money (property) go dey transferred and redistributed wey go favor de bank wey dey issue and de first receivers of money dem and sellers . Rothbard explain say,

> De people wey receive the money first na im go gain de most, de next go gain small put, etc., sotey de middle go come reach, and from dere every person wey dey receive go dey lose more and more as e dey wait for new money. For de person wey come first selling price go run up while buying price go remain almost where e stand put; but later, buying prices go don rise while selling price nor go don change.[^28]

According to wetin Selgin and White don talk, sha, fiduciary media fit achieve far more. Instead of to dey only redistribute property wey dey, de matter wey concern fiduciary media fit , under some kind level, e fit lead to increase for real money (property). We don already quote them wehen they talk say “benefits wey bank borrowers go get who dey enjoy steady supply of intermediate credit, and for everybody wey dey work with the bigger stock of capital equipment wey dey de economy as time dey go”. Dem dodge to put am like dis make e dey clear,yet wetin dem dey claim na say, under specific parol, increase for title for fund wey never change for goods go make the fund grow or go stop am to reduce.

Wen and how dat kind miracle wan take happen? According to wetin Selgin and White talk, (unexpected) change for the demand for money go lead to “temporary” or “short-run monetary disequilibrum” wey go involve “serious misallocation of resources”- dat na, *unless* dat kind change fall put for fractional reserve banking practices. Dem yarn say:

> For de long run, nominal price go take dressing to equal supply and demand for money to balance, no matter de amount of nominal money wey dey. E nor follow, sha, say each and every *change* for de supply or demand for money go lead *sharparly* to new long-run equilibrium, because the price adjustment wey we dey expect go take time. Dem dey take time because nor be all agents dey aware instantly and perfectly for change wey don happen for de money wey dey stock or money demand, and because e go cost to increase some price and therefore “sticky”. E follow say, for the short time (by observation,reason “for some months”), less dan the change wey we dey expect for the supply of or demand for money fit lead to monetary disequilibrum….Na for dat reason e come become attractive feature for free banking wey get fractional reserves wey the nominal amount of bank-issued money dey be like e wan adjust so as to clear changes for the movement of money.[^29]
> 
> If de banking system come fail to increase the amount of money wey dem issue and the price level no con drop sharparly, na excess demand for money go happen (assuming say amount of base money too no increase sharp sharp). E go make excess supply of goods rise : consumer goods wey dem neva sell go pile up for sellers dem shelves (this of course go put downward pressure for price until last last goods proce go don fall enough). Business go dey low key until de power of money to buy con rise back to where e bin dey.[^30]

From de beginning, person gats wonder about the fact say d problem about monetary disequilibrum dey(not to talk of the solution). For the quote wey ah just throw, person fit put any goods in place of money: televisions, steel, beer, or pretzels. The amount of goods like this ones dey fixed one kind (so also the quantity of gold), and yet (unexepected) change for the demand for televisions, steel, beer, or pretzels no dey lead to temporary disequilibria wey involve serious misdividing of resources. Or, for any way, dey no dey cause gbenge wey go require make dem bring special new device ( like fractional television or beer production).

E no even still clear why we suppose believe say “e dey important to dey divide between short-run and long-run effect of changes for the demand schedule for money or wey dey the stock of money”.[^31] or, for any matter, why e be say the difference suppose dey of different importance or value in the case wey involve money from one wey concern any other thing. To dey sure, e dey take time before increase wey no dey expected for increase for the demand for television and beer, for example, go don finish all e effect for the system for relative process and one new adjustment production structure go don dey established. But this no mean say price adjustment dey take time (wey go dey cause short-run gbenge). But opposite, price adjustment go happen immediately and no go waste time. This fact don dey overlooked because of un-Austrian concern for macroeconomic artifacts like de general price level, long-run equilibrium, and the wey money dey waka. Sha, when we look am from correct individualist angle, doubt no go dey regarding the fact say proce adjustment dey happen instant plus to consider de human involvement of de short and de long run.

For individualistic term, increase for de demand for money na de result of the action of individuals wey don do on purpose; that is, people mind for increasing their own cash balance. To do am, person gats reduce the buying wey im dey do and/or increase e sales. For either side, de result na immediate fall for some of the prices.  As e be say person don reduce e buy buy of x,y,z, de money price of x,y,z go come reduce instant (compared to wetin for happen for the other case), and same way, if person reduce e  sales of a, b, or c, their price go fall instant. Nobody dey worry about the general proce level or de generalized ability of money to fit buy. Instead, everybody dey reason the specific prices and the power wey money get regarding some special items (and everybody dey interested on e own and different special range wey price get and e power to buy). As e limit e specific buy buy and/or say he increase he specific sales, each person wey dey involved go achieve exactly and instanta wetin e want: so kind price wey e be like e too high go dey reduced, de power of  a unit money to buy go increase, de real value of e cash balance go rise, and e demand and supply of money go come back to equilibrium instanta (and e no wan hold either more or less money dan wetin e actually get) .[^32]

The adjustment of the praxeologically meaningless general price level wey come as a result of increase for demand for money na nothing but de addition of series of of immediate and purposeful individual cash-balance adjustments wey we no fit count. If de increase for de demand for money dey followed by the issue of fiduciary media, as Selgin and White don support dis adjustment process no go get support but go dey delayed.[^33] De speed wey de price go take adjust dey depend on the wetin de market-participants dey expect concerning dat quantity of  money wey don knack ground. If e make sense to think say fractional reserve banks go increase their fiduciary issues to response to unexpected increase for de demand for money, den de adjustment go take *more* time. Production go adjust and go start *earlier* without say inflation influence join.[^34]

By de way, de solution wey dem don put for ground wey go handle de problem as dem say of short-run monetary disequilibrum go  show basic confusion wey concern de concept of demand (and supply), and de way demand for money, saving, and investment in particular dey related. First, increase for demand for money (as for televisions, beer, or pretzels) no be just a wish to get more money (or televisions, beer, etc.), but *effective* demand. Dat na, increased demand for money (as for anything else) go fit dey satisfied only if de demander dey willing to increase e market-supply of and/or reduce his demand for anoda thing. So also, the supplier (seller) of money go fit only increase e supply of money if he reduces the same time, de supply of (or e reservation demand for) anoda thing. De authors don overlook Say’s law: all goods (property) dey bought with oda goods, nobody fit  demand anything without supplying another thing, and nobody fit demand or supply more of anytin unless he go demands or supplies small of something else. Through the issue and sale of fiduciary media, wishes don dey accepted, not effective demand. Property don dey appropriated (effectively demanded) without say he supply oda property as exchange. So, dis nor be market exchange—which dey governed by Say’s law—but na act of undue appropriation. Or e go be a good solution to de kasala of unexpected  short-run television, beer, or pretzel-shortages if television, beer, and pretzel producers for try allow dat kind increased demand “temporarily” by say you dey give and sell additional titles give televisions, beer, and pretzels but nor be dis goods themselves?

Second, Selgin and White come go ahead to bullshit the nature wey money get and de demand for money wey dey hand to even talk de big one say the issue of fiduciary media “*wey dey matched with increased demand to hold fiduciary media*” nor dey only disequilibrating, but go actually make de economy get “larger stock of capital equipment”, sake of say

> [t]he parol to hold fractional-reserve *bank-issued* money nor go only (like as person dey hold base money) put down consumption for longer or shorter period,  but go also *temporarily lends funds* to de bank wey issue am as e dey go on. De period wey de loan go last no dey known…but if de bank fit estimate with small correctness de amount of time wey de demand claims go dey go round…e fit do proper investments of corresponding length.[^35]

As e dey follow de lead wey Rothbard don set, Hoppe come dey  talk down this important Keynesian view wey concern de relationship wey dey between demand for money and savings (loanable funds)[^36] by pointing out say

> To nor spend money na to buy *neither* consumer goods *nor* investment goods… People  fit use their monetary property for one of dis three ways. Dem fit spend am on consumer goods; dem fit spend am on investment; or dem fit keep am as cash. No oda way dey…De consumption/investment proportion i.e., decision on wetin to spend and how much to invest, dey determined by person own choice of time;i.e., de extent to which e prefer to consume  now against to consume for future. For de oda side, de origin of e demand for cash na wetin e wan use the money for;i.e., the joy wey e derive from money dey allow am instant buying of directly or indirectly serviceable consumer or producer goods for future date wey e never know.
> 
> As e be like dat, if de demand for money come increase while de social stock of money don comot hand, de additional demand go fit dey satisfied by only say dem bid down de money price for goods wey nor involve money. De power wey money get to buy go increase, de *real* value wey individual cash get  go rise, and for higher power wey money come get to buy per unit money, de demand for and de supply of money go once again dey equal. De relative price wey money get versus non-money go don change. But *unless* we come assume say time preference don change for dat same time, *real* consumption and *real* investment go remain de same like before: de additional money demand go dey satisfied if e reduce nominal consumption *and* investment wey e dey spend according to de former consumption/investment ratio wey dey before, e go drive de money prices of both consumer and even producer goods down wey go con leave real consumption and investment for exactly where dem dey before.[^37]

As e be like that, Hoppe come conclude say, e *never* dey warranted to accept increased demand for money by giving out fiduciary credit.[^38]. In fact, to do like dat go either- so long as de increase of fiduciary media wey we don accept dey unexpected and de market rate of interest come fall temporarily below de normal level of interest- go lead to boom-bust cycle; or else- so long as de change for money level wey dey come from de bank dey expected and de market rate of interest come dey built up (as we dey expect higher selling prices) to follow de height wey de natural rate don set- e go see notin wey pass common wealth and income redistribution among de different members of de society. E sha dey humanly impossible, say, de issue of fiduciary media fit lead to “enlarged stock of capital equipment”.

[^30]: Ibid., p. 105\. As Roger Garrison, anoda fractional reserve free banker, don put am, “in terms of de equation of exchange [MV=PQ], we fit talk say free banking adjusts M so as to offset changes in V; but dey allow changes for Q to be accommodated by changes for P”. Garrison don describe de short-run “monetary disequilibrium”almost de same way:

> Increase for de demand for money go put downward pressure for product and factor prices in general. If  money-supply response nor come show, a general decline for economic activity go follow, since prices and wages nor fit fully and instantaneously adjust demselves to de new market conditions. Goods in general nor go sell; production go cut; workers go collect sack…. Wit less-dan-perfectly flexible price system, general deflationary pressures fit push de economy below e potential during de period wey prices dey adjust to de higher monetary demand. And de fact say some prices and some wages dey more flexible dan odas means say de adjustment period go involve changes for relative prices wey nor go reflect changes for relative scarcities. Na dis be precisely de kind problem … wey dey avoided by free banking’s responsiveness to increases for money demand. (“Central Banking, Free Banking, and Financial Crises”, *Review of Austrian Economics* 9, no. 2(1996): 117)

[^31]: Selgin and White, “In Defense of Fiduciary Media”, p. 100.

[^32]: So Mises come write say:

> Buyers and sellers for de market nor dey concern demselves wit de elements for de equation of exchange, of which two—velocity of circulation and de price level—nor even dey exist before market parties act and de oda two—de quantity of money (for de whole economy) and de sum of transactions— nor go dey possibly known to de parties for de market. Na only de importance wey de various actors for de market attach, on one hand, to de maintenance of cash balance of certain magnitude and, on de oda hand, to de ownership of de various goods wey we dey yearn about dey determine de formation of de exchange relationship between money and goods. (“The Position of Money AmongEconomic Goods”, in *Money, Method, and the Market Process*, Richard Ebeling, ed. [Boston: Kluwer, 1990], p. 61)

[^33]: Moreova, from individualist perspective, de increased demand for money dey happen with specific actors at specific times and places. E nor dey enough for banks to accommodate some abstract higher money demand by more money; instead, but de accommodation gats  occur precisely wit de correct people and locations. If dis nor be de case, one go hardly fit talk of an accommodation but of an additional distortion. Dis difficulty don dey recognized by the early Hayek:

> in order to comot all monetary influences for de formation of prices, and de structure of production, e nor go dey sufficient merely quantitatively to adapt de supply of money for dese changes for demand, e go dey necessary also to see say exactly enter de hands of dose wey actually need am; dat is, to dat part of de system whey de change for business organization or de habits of payment don happen. (*Prices and Production* [London: Routledge, 1935], p. 124)

With de one wey Hayek talk last, person go wonder how bank go get de required knowledge to perform dis kind task. 

[^34]: Concerning de stickiness wey price get, and de redistributive consequences for increase demand for money thru array of prices of varying degrees of stickiness, wey Selgin and White as well as Garrison don raise as matters of concern, na of utmost importance to recognize say prices na de outcome of purposive action—and na so dia stickiness be. Dat is, de flexibility or inflexibility of various product and service prices nor dey accidental to, but na deliberate part of, dese products and services. Against wetin Garrison dey claim, de stickiness of prices dey affect and dey related to, real relative scarcities. If more sticky prices suffer more, to talk like dat, make e happen; e go teach dem to dey less sticky for future—if de owners of de property in question act for manner wey dey compatible with dis end.

[^35]: Selgin and White, “In Defense of Fiduciary Media”, p. 103\. De error of confusing property and titles dey lie also for de bottom of Selgin and White’s attempts to separate analytically de demand for outside money from de demand for inside money, as if dese na  somehow two different kinds of money wit two different and independent demands.

[^36]: Selgin talk de same thesis as e be so:

> Weneva a bank dey expand e liabilities in the process of making new loans and investments, na dem be de holders of de liabilities wey be de ultimate lenders of credit, and wetin dem dey lend na de real resources dem fit acquire if, instead of holding money, dem spend an. Wen de expansion or contraction of bank liabilities dey proceed for dat kind way as to be at all times in agreement wit changing demands for inside money, de quantity of real capital funds supplied to borrowers by de banks dey equal to de quantity wey dem voluntarily offer give  de banks by the public. Under dis conditions, banks na simply intermediaries of loanable funds. (*The Theory of Free Banking: Money Supply under Competitive Note Issue*, p. 55)

As for John Maynard Keynes (*The General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money* [New York: Harcourt, Brace, 1936], p. 82), he don write say de notion say de creation of credit by banking systems dey allow investment to take place to which “no genuine saving” dey correspond; dat is, “the idea say saving and investment … fit dey different from one anotha, go dey explained, I think, by an optical illusion” (p. 81).

> [T]he savings wey result from dis decision dey just as genuine as any oda savings. Nobody fit dey compelled to own the additional money corresponding to the new bank-credit, unless he deliberately prefers to hold more money rada dan some oda form of wealth. (p. 83)

Truly, Selgin agree say

> many Keynesians fit accept de prescription for monetary equilibrium offered [by him]. Dose wey nor dey regard the liquidity trap as  important factual possibility go fit accept am as entirely adequate. (*The Theory of Free Banking*, p. 59)

Henry Hazlitt put mouth for dis Keynesian idea say

> [o]n de same reasoning we fit create any amount of new “savings” we wish overnight, simply by printing dat amount of new paper money, because *somebody* go necessarily hold dat new paper money! (*The Failure of the “New Economics”: An Analysis of the Keynesian Fallacies* [Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 1983], p. 227)

As for wetin Selgin and White claim for being Misesians, even dey worthwhile to quote Mises on

> de role wey cash holding dey play for de process of saving and capital accumulation…. [i]f person put some money nor be for consumption but for de purchase of factors of production, saving don directly turn into capital accumulation.  If de person saver come put e additional savings to dey increase e cash holding bcos dis for e eyes na de most advantageous mode of using dem, he go bring about a tendency for fall for commodity prices and a rise for de monetary unit’s purchasing power. If we assume say de supply of money for de market system no dey change, dis conduct for de part of de saver nor go directly influence de accumulation of capital and de way dem dey use am for expansion of production. De effect of we own saver’s saving, i.e., de surplus of goods produced over goods consumed, nor go  disappear on account of e hoarding. But de fact say more capital goods dey available nor dey affected by de striving of a number of pple to increase dia cash holdings. If nobody use de goods—de nonconsumption wey bring abt de additional savings for expansion of e consumptive spending, dem go remain as increment for de amount of capital goods available, whateva dia prices go be. De two processes—increased cash holding for some people and increased capital accumulation—dey happen side by side. A drop for commodity prices, wey oda things dey equal, go cause drop for de money equivalent of de various individuals’ capital. But dis nor dey tantamount to reduction for supply of capital goods and e nor require adjustment of production activities to where e go come dey poor. E dey merely alter de money items wey dem go apply for monetary calculation. (Mises, *Human Action*, pp. 521–22)
