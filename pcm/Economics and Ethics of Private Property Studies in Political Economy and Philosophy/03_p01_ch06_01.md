## How Fiat Money Dey Possible? – or, De Devolution of Money and Credit 

Fiat money na de term for a medium of exchange which is neither a commercial commodity, a consumer, a producer good, or title to any such commodity. Na de irredeemable paper money. In contrast, commodity money refer am to medium of exchange wey  be either a commercial commodity or a title thereto.

Doubt no dey for fiat money say e possible. Its theoretical possibility dey recognized long ago, and since 1971, when de last remnants of former international gold (commodity) standard dey abolished, all monies dey in fact nothing but irredeemable piece of paper.

De question we go addressed for dis paper na how fiat money go dey possible? More specifically, fiat money go arise as de natural outcome of de interactions between self-interested individuals; or, is it possible to introduce am without violation either principles of justice or economic efficiency?

E go argued say de answer to de latter question must be negative, and that no fiat money go ever arise “innocently” or “immaculately”. De arguments advancing this thesis go dey largely constructive and systematic. However, given de fact say de thesis dey frequently disputed, along de way various prominent counterarguments go dey criticized. Superficially, de arguments of de monetarists, especially Irving Fisher and Milton Friedman, and some Austrian “free bankers”, especially Lawrence White and George Selgin, in ethical and/or economic support of either a total or a fractional fiat money go refuted.

### De Origin Money

Man dey participates for exchange economy (instead make them remaining for self-sufficient isolation) insofar as he prefers plenty goods over small and dey capable of recognizing de high productivity of a system of division of labor. De same narrow intelligence and self-interest dey sufficient to explain de emergence of a-and ultimately only one-commodity money and a-and ultimately only one, worldwide-monetary economy.[^1] Finding their markets wey buyers and sellers of goods dey restricted to instances of double coincidence of wants (A wants what B has and B wants what A has), each person fit still expand him own market and thus profit more fully from de advantages of extended division of labor if him dey willing to accept not only directly useful goods in exchange, but also him goods with a higher degree of marketability than those surrendered. For even if them no get direct usevalue to an actor, de ownership of relatively more marketable goods implies by definition that this kind goods fit in turn be more easily resold for other, directly useful goods fit later exchanges, and hence their owner don come closer to reaching an ultimate goal unattainable through direct exchange.

Na only self-interest dey motivated am and based on de observation wey direct traded goods dey posse different degree of marketability, some people begin to ask specific goods not for their own sake but for de sake of employing them as a medium of exchange. By adding a new component to de pre-existing (barter) demand for dis goods, their marketability still dey further enhanced. Based on their perception of this fact, other market participants don increasingly choose de same goods for their inventory of exchange media, as e be for their own interest to select this kine commodities as media of exchange wey them already employed by others for de same purpose. Before before, different goods fit be in demand as common media of exchange. However, since them demand goods as a medium of exchange-rather than for consumption or production purposes-in order for facilitate future purchases of direct serviceable goods (i.e., to help one buy more cheaply) and simultaneously widen one’s market as a seller of directly useful goods and services (i.e., help one sell more dearly), de more widely a commodity fit use as a medium of exchange, de better e go perform him function/ because each market participant naturally prefers de acquisition wey dey more marketable and, in de end, universally marketable medium of exchange wey dey less or non-universally marketable one, 

inevitable tendency go dey for de less marketable of de series of goods them use as media of exchange to be one by one rejected until at last only one single commodity remained, wey be universally employed as a medium of exchange; in a word, money.[^2]

With this, and for history with de establishment of de international gold standard in de course of de nineteenth century (until 1914), de end desired through any one market participant’s demand for media of exchange dey fully accomplished. With de prices of all consumer and capital; good expressed in terms of a single commodity, demand and supply fit take effect on a worldwide scale, unrestricted by absences of double coincidence of wants. Becus of him universal acceptability, accounting in terms of such money contains de most complete and accurate expression of any producers’ opportunity costs. At de same time, with only one universal money in use-rather than several ones of limited acceptability-de market participants’ expenditures (of directly serviceable goods) on holdings of only indirectly useful media of exchange dey optionally economized; and with expenditure of indirectly useful goods so economized, real wealth (wealth in de form of stocks of producer and consumer goods) dey optimized as well.

According to a long-Spanish-French-Austrian-American-tradition of monetary theory,[^3] a money’s originary function-arising out of de existence of uncertainty-na that of a medium of exchange. Money must emerge as a commodity money becus something fit demand as a medium of exchange only if e get pre-existing barter demand (indeed, e must get a highly marketable barter commodity), and de competition between monies qua media of exchange investable dey lead to tendency of covering toward a single money-as de most easily resold and readily accepted commodity.

For inside this, different popular nations of monetary theory don immediately revealed as misguided or fallacious.

What about de idea wey commodity reserve currency? Fit bundles (baskets) of goods or titles thereto be money?[^4] No, because bundles of different goods wey by definition dey less easily salable than de most easily salable of de various components, and hence commodity basket wey uniquely unsuited to perform dey function of a medium of exchange (and it thus is no mere accident that no historical example for such money exist).

What about de-Friedmanite-idea of freely fluctuating “national monies” or of “optimal currency areas?”[^5] E must be regarded as absurd, except say na intermediate step in de development of an inter-national money. Strictly speaking, a monetary system with rival monies of freely fluctuating exchange rate na still system of partial barter, riddles with de problem of requiring double coincidence of wants in order for exchanges to take place. De lasting existence of such a system na dysfunctional of de very purpose of money: of facilitating exchange (instead of make e dey more difficult) and of expanding one’s market (rather than restricting it). There are no more “optimal”-local, regional or multinational monies or currency areas than there are “optimal trading area”. Instead, as long as more wealth is preferred to less and under conditions of uncertainty, just as the only “optimal” trading area is the whole world market, so de only “option” money na one money and de only “optimal” currency area de entire globe.

What about de idea, central to monetarist thought since Irving Fisher, say money na “measure of value” and of de notion of monetary “stabilization?”[^6] E represents a tangle of confusion and falsehood. First and foremost, while there exists a motive, a purpose wey actors wan get their own media of exchange, no motive, purpose or need fit discovered for wanting to posses a measure of value. Action and exchange are expressive of preferences-each person values what he acquires more highly than what he surrenders-not of identity or equivalency. No body ever need to measure value. E dey easily explained why actors fit use cardinal numbers-to count-and construct measurement instruments-to measure space, weight, mass and time: for inside world of quantitative determinateness, where means fit only produce limited effects, counting and measuring are de prerequisite for successful action. But what imaginable technical or economic need could there possibly be for a measure of value? 

Second, make we set dis difficulties aside for a moment and assuming say money indeed measures value (such that de money price dem pay for a good represents a cardinal measure this good’s value) in de same way na him ruler measures space, another insurmountable problem results. Then de question arises “wating be de value of this measure of value?” Surely e must get value just as a ruler must get value, otherwise no body go want get either one. Yet e go dey obviously to absurd to answer that de value of a unit of money—one dollar—na one. One what? Such a reply go be as nonsensical as answering a question wey concern de value of a yardstick by saying “one yard”. De value wey cardinal measure no go fit expressed in terms of this measure itself. Rather, him value must be expressed in ordinal terms: E dey better to get cardinal numbers and measures of length or weight than merely to get ordinal measures for person disposal. Likewise e dey better if, becus of de existence of a medium of exchange, one dey able to resort to cardinal numbers for person cost accounting, rather than make we rely only on ordinal accounting procedures, as go be de case in a barter economy. But e go dey impossible to express for cardinal terms how much more valuable de former techniques are as compared with de latter. Only ordinal judgments dey possible. E dey precisely in this sense, then, that ordinal numbers—ranking, preferring—must dey regarded as more fundamental than cardinal ones and value go dey considered an irreducibly subjective, nonquantifiable magnitude.

Moreover, if e go indeed de function of money go serve as a measure of value, person must wonder why de demand for such a thing go ever systematically pass one per person. De demand for rulers, scales, and clocks, for instance, pass one per person only becuse of differences for location (handiness) or de possibility of their breaking or failing. Apart from this, for any given point in time and space, no one go want to hold more than one measurement instrument of homogeneous quality, becus a single measurement instrument fit render all possible measurement services. A second instrument of him kind go be useless.

Third, in any case, whatever de characteristicum specificum of money fit be, money good. Yet if e good, then e falls under de law of marginal utility, and this law dey contradicts any notion of stable- or constant-valued good. De law wey follow from de proposition wey every actor, at any given point in time, acts in accordance with him subjective preference scale and chooses to do wating him expects—rightly or wrongly—to satisfy him more rather than less, and that if him do like this he must invariably employ quantitatively definite (limited) units of qualitatively distinct goods as means and thus, by implication, must dey capable to recognizing unit-additions and -subtractions to and from him supply of means. From this incontestably true proposition e follows that actor always dey prefer a larger supply of a good over a small small one (he ranks de marginal utility of a larger sized unit of a good dey  higher than de small small sized unit of de same good) and that any increment to de supply of a good by an additional unit—of any unit-size wey an actor considers and distinguishes as relevant—go dey ranked lower (valued less) than any same-sized unit of this good already in person possession, for e go only be employed as a means for de removal of an uneasiness deemed wey no dey urgent than de least urgent one up-to-now satisfied by tde same sized unit of dis good. In other words, de marginal utility of a given-sized unit of a good reduce or increases as de supply of dis kine units increases or reduces. Each change for de supply of a good therefore dey lead to a change for dis good’s marginal utility. Any change for de supply of a good A, as dem perceived am by an actor X, leads to X’s re-evaluation of A. X attaches a different value-rank to A now. Hence, de search for a stable or constant-valued good dey obviously illusory from de outset, for a par with wanting to square de circle, for each action involves exchange, and each exchange alters de supply of de some good. E either results for a diminution of de supply of a good (as in pure consumption), or e go lead to a diminution of one and an incrementation of another (as in production or interpersonal exchange). For either case, as supplies are changed in de course of any action, so are de values of de goods involved. To act na to purposefully alter de value of goods. Hence, a stable-valued good—money or anything else—go dey considered a constructive or praxeological impossibility.

Finally, as regards de idea of money-a dollar-of constant purchasing power, there is de fundamental problem that de purchasing power of money no fit be measured de construction of price indices-any index-na scientifically arbitrary. (Which goods then fit include? What relative weight them fit attached to each of them? What about de problem that individual actors value de same things differently and are concerned about different commodity baskets, or that de same individual evaluates de same basket differently at different times? Waiting person go do to changes for de quality of goods or with entirely new products?)[^7] Moreover, wating dey so great about “stable” purchasing power anyway (however that term fitbe arbitrarily defined)? To dey sure, e dey obviously preferable to get a “stable” money rather than an “inflationary” one. Yet surely money wey purchasing power per unit increased- “deflationary” money-would be preferable to “stable” one.

What about de thesis wey in the absence of any legal restrictions money—no-interest-bearing money—go dey completely replaced by interest-bearing securities?[^8] Dis kine displacement dey conceivable only for equilibrium, where there uncertainty no dey and hence no one go gain any satisfaction from prepared for future contingencies as these na per assumption ruled out of existence. Under de omnipresent human condition of uncertainty, however, even if all legal restrictions removed de entry free, a demand for non-interest-bearing money—as distinct from a demand for equity or debt claims (stocks, bonds or mutual fund shares)—go necessarily remain in effect, for whatever de specific nature of these claims fit be, they represent titles to producer goods, otherwise they no go it yield interest. Yet even de most easily convertible production factor must be less salable than de most salable one of him final products, and hence, even de most liquid security fit never perform de same service of preparing him owner for future contingencies as fit be provided by de most marketable final non-interest-bearing product: money. All of this fit be different only if them assumed—as Wallace in accordance with de Chicago School’s egalitarian predispositions tacitly do—that all goods dey equally marketable. Then, by definition difference no dey between de salability of money and securities. However, them must assumed all goods to identical to each other, and if this na de case neither division of labor nor markets go exist.
