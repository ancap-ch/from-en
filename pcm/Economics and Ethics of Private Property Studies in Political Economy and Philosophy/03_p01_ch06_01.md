## How Fiat Money Dey Possible? – or, De Devolution of Money and Credit 

Fiat money na de term for a medium of exchange which is neither a commercial commodity, a consumer, a producer good, or title to any such commodity. Na de irredeemable paper money. In contrast, commodity money refer am to medium of exchange wey  be either a commercial commodity or a title thereto.

Doubt no dey for fiat money say e possible. Its theoretical possibility dey recognized long ago, and since 1971, when de last remnants of former international gold (commodity) standard dey abolished, all monies dey in fact nothing but irredeemable piece of paper.

De question we go addressed for dis paper na how fiat money go dey possible? More specifically, fiat money go arise as de natural outcome of de interactions between self-interested individuals; or, is it possible to introduce am without violation either principles of justice or economic efficiency?

E go argued say de answer to de latter question must be negative, and that no fiat money go ever arise “innocently” or “immaculately.” De arguments advancing this thesis go dey largely constructive and systematic. However, given de fact say de thesis dey frequently disputed, along de way various prominent counterarguments go dey criticized. Superficially, de arguments of de monetarists, especially Irving Fisher and Milton Friedman, and some Austrian “free bankers,” especially Lawrence White and George Selgin, in ethical and/or economic support of either a total or a fractional fiat money go refuted.

### De Origin Money

Man dey participates for exchange economy (instead make them remaining for self-sufficient isolation) insofar as he prefers plenty goods over small and dey capable of recognizing de high productivity of a system of division of labor. De same narrow intelligence and self-interest dey sufficient to explain de emergence of a-and ultimately only one-commodity money and a-and ultimately only one, worldwide-monetary economy.[^1] Finding their markets wey buyers and sellers of goods dey restricted to instances of double coincidence of wants (A wants what B has and B wants what A has), each person fit still expand him own market and thus profit more fully from de advantages of extended division of labor if him dey willing to accept not only directly useful goods in exchange, but also him goods with a higher degree of marketability than those surrendered. For even if them no get direct usevalue to an actor, de ownership of relatively more marketable goods implies by definition that this kind goods fit in turn be more easily resold for other, directly useful goods fit later exchanges, and hence their owner don come closer to reaching an ultimate goal unattainable through direct exchange.

Na only self-interest dey motivated am and based on de observation wey direct traded goods dey posse different degree of marketability, some people begin to ask specific goods not for their own sake but for de sake of employing them as a medium of exchange. By adding a new component to de pre-existing (barter) demand for dis goods, their marketability still dey further enhanced. Based on their perception of this fact, other market participants don increasingly choose de same goods for their inventory of exchange media, as e be for their own interest to select this kine commodities as media of exchange wey them already employed by others for de same purpose. Before before, different goods fit be in demand as common media of exchange. However, since them demand goods as a medium of exchange-rather than for consumption or production purposes-in order for facilitate future purchases of direct serviceable goods (i.e., to help one buy more cheaply) and simultaneously widen one’s market as a seller of directly useful goods and services (i.e., help one sell more dearly), de more widely a commodity fit use as a medium of exchange, de better e go perform him function/ because each market participant naturally prefers de acquisition wey dey more marketable and, in de end, universally marketable medium of exchange wey dey less or non-universally marketable one, 

inevitable tendency go dey for de less marketable of de series of goods them use as media of exchange to be one by one rejected until at last only one single commodity remained, wey be universally employed as a medium of exchange; in a word, money.[^2]

With this, and for history with de establishment of de international gold standard in de course of de nineteenth century (until 1914), de end desired through any one market participant’s demand for media of exchange dey fully accomplished. With de prices of all consumer and capital; good expressed in terms of a single commodity, demand and supply fit take effect on a worldwide scale, unrestricted by absences of double coincidence of wants. Becus of him universal acceptability, accounting in terms of such money contains de most complete and accurate expression of any producers’ opportunity costs. At de same time, with only one universal money in use-rather than several ones of limited acceptability-de market participants’ expenditures (of directly serviceable goods) on holdings of only indirectly useful media of exchange dey optionally economized; and with expenditure of indirectly useful goods so economized, real wealth (wealth in de form of stocks of producer and consumer goods) dey optimized as well.

According to a long-Spanish-French-Austrian-American-tradition of monetary theory,[^3] a money’s originary function-arising out of de existence of uncertainty-na that of a medium of exchange. Money must emerge as a commodity money becus something fit demand as a medium of exchange only if e get pre-existing barter demand (indeed, e must get a highly marketable barter commodity), and de competition between monies qua media of exchange investable dey lead to tendency of covering toward a single money-as de most easily resold and readily accepted commodity.

For inside this, different popular nations of monetary theory don immediately revealed as misguided or fallacious.

What about de idea wey commodity reserve currency? Fit bundles (baskets) of goods or titles thereto be money?[^4] No, because bundles of different goods wey by definition dey less easily salable than de most easily salable of de various components, and hence commodity basket wey uniquely unsuited to perform dey function of a medium of exchange (and it thus is no mere accident that no historical example for such money exist).

What about de-Friedmanite-idea of freely fluctuating “national monies” or of “optimal currency areas?”[^5] E must be regarded as absurd, except say na intermediate step in de development of an inter-national money. Strictly speaking, a monetary system with rival monies of freely fluctuating exchange rate na still system of partial barter, riddles with de problem of requiring double coincidence of wants in order for exchanges to take place. De lasting existence of such a system na dysfunctional of de very purpose of money: of facilitating exchange (instead of make e dey more difficult) and of expanding one’s market (rather than restricting it). There are no more “optimal”-local, regional or multinational monies or currency areas than there are “optimal trading area.” Instead, as long as more wealth is preferred to less and under conditions of uncertainty, just as the only “optimal” trading area is the whole world market, so de only “option” money na one money and de only “optimal” currency area de entire globe.

What about de idea, central to monetarist thought since Irving Fisher, say money na “measure of value” and of de notion of monetary “stabilization?”[^6] E represents a tangle of confusion and falsehood. First and foremost, while there exists a motive, a purpose wey actors wan get their own media of exchange, no motive, purpose or need fit discovered for wanting to posses a measure of value. Action and exchange are expressive of preferences-each person values what he acquires more highly than what he surrenders-not of identity or equivalency. No body ever need to measure value. E dey easily explained why actors fit use cardinal numbers-to count-and construct measurement instruments-to measure space, weight, mass and time: for inside world of quantitative determinateness, where means fit only produce limited effects, counting and measuring are de prerequisite for successful action. But what imaginable technical or economic need could there possibly be for a measure of value? 

Second, setting these difficulties aside for a moment and assuming that money indeed measures value (such that the money price paid for a good represents a cardinal measure of this good’s value) in the same way as a ruler measures space, another insurmountable problem results. Then the question arises “what is the value of this measure of value?” Surely it must have value just as a ruler must have value, otherwise no one would want to own either one. Yet it would obviously be absurd to answer that the value of a unit of money—one dollar—is one. One what? Such a reply would be as nonsensical as answering a question concerning the value of a yardstick by saying “one yard.” The value of a cardinal measure cannot be expressed in terms of this measure itself. Rather, *its* value must be expressed in ordinal terms: It is better to have cardinal numbers and measures of length or weight than merely to have ordinal measures at one’s disposal. Likewise it is better if, because of the existence of a medium of exchange, one is able to resort to cardinal numbers in one’s costaccounting, rather than having to rely solely on ordinal accounting procedures, as would be the case in a barter economy. But it is impossible to express in cardinal terms *how much* more valuable the former techniques are as compared with the latter. Only ordinal judgments are possible. It is precisely in this sense, then, that ordinal numbers—ranking, preferring—must be regarded as more fundamental than cardinal ones and value be considered an irreducibly subjective, nonquantifiable magnitude.

Moreover, if it were indeed the function of money to serve as a measure of value, one must wonder why the demand for such a thing should ever systematically exceed one per person. The demand for rulers, scales, and clocks, for instance, exceeds one per person only because of differences in location (handiness) or the possibility of their breaking or failing. Apart from this, at any given point in time and space, no one would want to hold more than one measurement instrument of homogeneous quality, because a *single* measurement instrument can render *all* possible measurement services. A second instrument of its kind would be useless.

Third, in any case, whatever the *characteristicum specificum* of money may be, money is a *good*. Yet if it is a good, then it falls under the law of marginal utility, and this law *contradicts* any notion of a stable- or constant-valued good. The law follows from the proposition that every actor, at any given point in time, acts in accordance with his subjective preference scale and chooses to do what he expects—rightly or wrongly—to satisfy him more rather than less, and that in so doing he must invariably employ quantitatively definite (limited) units of qualitatively distinct goods as means and thus, by implication, must be capable of recognizing unit-additions and -subtractions to and from his supply of means. From this incontestably true proposition it follows that an actor always prefers a larger supply of a good over a smaller one (he ranks the marginal utility of a larger sized unit of a good higher than that of a smaller sized unit of the same good) and that any increment to the supply of a good by an additional unit—of any unit-size that an actor considers and distinguishes as relevant—will be ranked lower (valued less) than any same-sized unit of this good *already* in one’s possession, for it can only be employed as a means for the removal of an uneasiness deemed less urgent than the least urgent one *up-to-now* satisfied by the same sized unit of this good. In other words, the marginal utility of a given-sized unit of a good decreases or increases as the supply of such units increases or decreases. Each change in the supply of a good therefore leads to a change in this good’s marginal utility. Any change in the supply of a good A, as perceived by an actor X, leads to X’s *re*-evaluation of A. X attaches a *different* value-rank to A now. Hence, the search for a stable or constant-valued good is obviously illusory from the outset, on a par with wanting to square the circle, for every action involves exchange, and every exchange alters the supply of some good. It either results in a diminution of the supply of a good (as in pure consumption), or it leads to a diminution of one and an incrementation of another (as in production or interpersonal exchange). In either case, as supplies are changed in the course of any action, so are the values of the goods involved. To act is to purposefully *alter* the value of goods. Hence, a stable-valued good—money or anything else—must be considered a constructive or praxeological impossibility.

Finally, as regards the idea of a money—a dollar—of constant purchasing power, there is the fundamental problem that the purchasing power of money *cannot be measured* and that the construction of price indices—any index—is scientifically arbitrary. (What goods are to be included? What relative weight should be attached to each of them? What about the problem that individual actors value the same things differently and are concerned about different commodity baskets, or that the same individual evaluates the same basket differently at different times? What is one to do with changes in the quality of goods or with entirely new products?)[^7] Moreover, what is so great about “stable” purchasing power anyway (however that term maybe arbitrarily defined)? To be sure, it is obviously preferable to have a “stable” money rather than an “inflationary” one. Yet surely a money whose purchasing power per unit *increased*—“deflationary” money—would be preferable to a “stable” one.

What about the thesis that in the absence of any legal restrictions money—non-interest-bearing cash—would be completely replaced by interest-bearing securities?[^8] Such displacement is conceivable only in equilibrium, where there is no uncertainty and hence no one could gain any satisfaction from being prepared for future contingencies as these are per assumption ruled out of existence. Under the omnipresent human condition of uncertainty, however, even if all legal restrictions on free entry were removed, a demand for non-interest-bearing cash—as distinct from a demand for equity or debt claims (stocks, bonds or mutual fund shares)—would necessarily remain in effect, for whatever the specific nature of these claims may be, they represent titles to *producer* goods, otherwise they *cannot* yield interest. Yet even the most easily convertible production factor must be less salable than the most salable one of its final products, and hence, even the most liquid security can never perform the same service of preparing its owner for future contingencies as can be provided by the most marketable *final* non-interest-bearing product: money. All of this could be different only if it were assumed—as Wallace in accordance with the Chicago School’s egalitarian predispositions tacitly does—that all goods are equally marketable. Then, by definition there is no difference between the salability of cash and securities. However, then all goods must be assumed to be identical to each other, and if this were the case neither division of labor nor markets would exist.
