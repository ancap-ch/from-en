Make I start with Mises’s solution. Wetin be de logical status of a typical economic proposition like de law of marginal utility (dat whenever de supply of a good wey e b say units dey regarded as equal serviceability by person come increase by one additional unit, de value wey dey attached to dis unit gats decrease as e go only fit dey employed as a means for de attainment of a goal wey dey considered less valuable dan de least valuable goal previously satisfied by a unit of dis good) or of de quantity deory of money (say whenever de quantity of money come increase while de demand for money wey suppose dey hand as reserve nor change, de purchasing power of money go fall)?

As e dey formulate e answer, Mises be face double challenge. For one side, the answer wey modern empiricism offer dey. De Vienna Ludwig von Mises know say truely na one of the first centres of empiricist movement: place wey be don dey establish itself as de dominant academic philosophy of de Western world for plenty decades, and till today, dey shape de image wey almost all de economists get dia own discipline.[^2]

[^2]: On de Vienna Circle make you see Viktor Kraft, *Der Wiener Kreis* (Wien: Springer, 1968); for empiricist-positivist interpretations of economics go check representative works like Terrence W. Hutchison, *De Significance and Basic Postulates of Economic Deory* (London: Macmillan, 1938). Hutchison, wey dey follow de Popperian variant of empiricism, since don become much less enthusiastic about de prospects of a Popperized economics—see, for instance, e *Knowledge and Ignorance in Economics* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1977)—yet he nor still see alternative rather than to dey with Popper’s falsification is. Also go check Milton Friedman, “De Methodology of Positive Economics” in idem, *Essays in Positive Economics* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1953); Mark Blaug, *De Methodology of Economics* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980); a positivist account by person wey attend Mises’s Privat-Seminar in Vienna is Felix Kaufmann, *Methodology of de Social Sciences* (New York: Humanities Press, 1958); de dominance of empiricism in economics dey documented by de fact say dere probably nor get single textbook wey nor dey explicitly classify economics as—what else?—an empirical (a posteriori) science.

Empiricism dey consider nature and de natural science as e model. To dey follow empiricism, de examples of economic propositions wey we just mention get de same logical status wey laws of nature get. Like laws of nature, dem state hypothetical relationships wey dey two or more events, and e go dey in de form of if-den statements. And like hypotheses of de natural sciences, de propositions of economics dey require continuous testing thru experience. A proposition wey concern  de relationship between economic events no go fit ever dey validated once and for all wen e go dey sure. Instead, e dey foreva subject to wetin go come out from contingent, future experiences. Such experience fit confirm de hypothesis. But this nor go prove say de hypothesis na true, since de economic proposition go use general terms (for philosophical terminology, universals) for e description of de related events and so go apply to an indefinite number of cases or instances, for de process, always leaving room for possibly falsifying future experiences. All wetin confirmation go prove na say de hypothesis neva turn out to dey wrong. On de other hand, de experience fit falsify de hypothesis. This go surely prove say somethin bin dey wrong with de hypothesis as e bin dey, but nor go prove say de hypothesized relationship between de specified events nor for fit dey observed.  E go merely show say considering and controlling person observations only what up to now don dey accounted for and controlled, de relationship neva show up yet.  E nor fit just dey ruled out, sha, say e fit show up as soon as some oder circumstances don dey under control.

De attitude wey dis philosophy dey fuels and wey don truly become characteristic of most contemporary economists and dia way of conducting dia business na one of skepticism wit de motto wey be “notin fit dey known wit certainty to dey impossible for de realm of economic phenomena”. Even more precisely, since empiricism dey conceive economic phenomena as objective data, extending for space and subject to quantifiable measurement—in strict analogy to de phenomena of de natural sciences—de peculiar skepticism of de empiricist economist fit dey described as dat wey concern social engineer wey nor go guarantee anything.[^3]

De oda challenge bin come from de side of the Historicist School. Truly, during Mises’s life in Austria and Switzerland, de historicist philosophy nai be de prevailing ideology of de German speaking universities and dia establishment. Wit de rise of empiricism e former prominence don reduce considerably. Howeva, over roughly de last decade historicism don regain momentum among de Western world’s academia. Today e dey pervasive under de names of hermeneutics, rhetoric, deconstructivism, and epistemological anarchism.[^4]

Rothbard, *Ludwig von Mises: Scholar, Creator, Hero* (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988); for critical survey of historicist ideas make you also see Karl R. Popper, *The Poverty of Historicism* (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1957); for representative of dr older version of a historicist interpretation of economics see Werner Sombart, *Die drei Nationalökonomien* (Munich: Duncker and Humblot, 1930); for de modern, hermeneutical twist Donald McCloskey, *The Rhetoric of Economics* (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1985); Ludwig Lachmann, “From Mises to Shackle: An Essay on Austrian Economics and the Kaleidic Society”, *Journal of Economic Literature* 14, no. 1 (1976).

For historicism, and most conspicuously for e contemporary versions, de model nor be nature but na literary text. According to wetin de historicist doctrine talk, economic phenomena nor be objective magnitudes wey go fit dey measured. Instead, dem be subjective expressions and interpretations wey dey unfold for history to dey understood and interpreted by de economist like literary text dey unfold before and e readers fit dey interprete. As subjective creations, de sequence for dia events nor dey follow objective law. Nothin for de literary text and nothin for de sequence of historical expressions and interpretations dey ruled by constant relations. Ehen, certain literary texts actually dey exist, and na so certain sequences of historical events be. But dis no mean say anythin gats happen for de order wey e happen. E simply happen. For de same way as person fit at any time invent different literary stories, history and de sequence of historical events fit between say e happen for ways wey dey entirely different. Moreova according to historicism, and particularly visible for e modern hermeneutical version, de formation of dese always contingently related human expressions and dia interpretations nor dey also constrained by any objective law. In literary production anythin fit deyexpressed or interpreted in any way, and along de same line, historical and economic events na anythin person expresses or interprets dem to be, and dia description by de historian and economist na dat time anytin den anytin wey e express or interprets say dese past subjective events don be.

De attitude wey historicist philosophy don generates na one of relativism. E motto na “everything dey possible”. Unconstrained by any objective law, history, economics, and literary criticism na matters of esthetics for de historicist-hermeneutician. As evidence be like dat, e output don take on de form of disquisitions on wetin person feel about wetin he feel say anoda person dey feel. This na literary y form wit wetin we don dey too familiar wit, particularly for fields like sociology and political science.[^5]

Person dey senses intuitively say sometin dey seriously wrong for both de empiricist as well as de historicist philosophies. Dia epistemological accounts nor even seem to dey fit dia own models wey dem don choose: nature for de one hand and literary texts for de oda. In any case, wit regard to economic propositions like de law of marginal utility or de quantity theory of money, dia accounts seem to dey simply wrong. De law of marginal utility certainly no dey strike person as hypothetical law wey dey foreva subject for e validation to confirming or disconfirming experiences wey dey pop up here or dere. And to conceive of de phenomena wey dem refer to for law as quantifiable magnitudes seem to dey nothing short of ridiculous. Nor be say de historicist interpretation seem to dey any beta. To think say de relationship between de events wey dem refer to for de quantity theory of money fit dey undone if person only wish am dey absurd. De idea appears no less absurd dat concepts like money, demand for money, and purchasing power dey formed without any objective constraints and dey refer merely to whimsical subjective creations. Instead, as against de empiricist doctrine, both examples of economic propositions appear to dey logically true and to refer to events wey dey subjective in nature. Contrary to historicism, e go seem say wetin they state nor fit dey possible to dey undone in all of history and contain conceptual distinctions wey, while dem refer to subjective events, dey nonetheless objectively constrained and incorporate universally valid knowledge

Like most of de economists wey dey beta known before am, Mises share dese intuitions.[^6] Yet for e quest for de foundation of economics, Mises go beyond intuition. He come take on de challenge wey empiricism and historicism don bring out in order to reconstruct de basis for which dese intuitions fit dey understood as correct and justified systematically. Even no want make e come  bring about  new discipline for economics, but as he dey explain wetin formerly dey only  grasped intuitively, Mises don go far beyond wetin dem don do before. In reconstructing de rational foundations of economists’ intuitions, he give us assurance for de proper path for any future development in economics and safeguards us against systematic intellectual error.

Cairnes, John Stuart Mill, Carl Menger, and Friedrich Wieser, see Ludwig von Mises, Epistemological Problems of Economics (New York: New York University Press, 1981), pp. 17–23; also Murray N. Rothbard, “Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics”, in Edwin Dolan, ed., De Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics (Kansas City: Sheed and Ward, 1976); Hoppe, Praxeology and Economic Science.

Empiricism and historicism, as Mises notes for de outset of e reconstruction, get self-contradictory doctrines.[^7] The empiricist notion say all events, natural or economic, dey only hypothetically related dey contradicted by de message of dis very basic empiricist proposition eself, for if to say dis proposition dey regarded as itself being merely hypothetically true (i.e., hypothetically true proposition regarding hypothetically true propositions), e nor go even qualify as  epistemological pronouncement. E nor go provide justification whatsoeva for de claim say economic propositions nor be and nor fit be categorically, or a priori, true as we own intuition don inform us say dem be. If, howeva, de basic empiricist premise bin dey assumed to dey categorically true (i.e., if we wan assume say person fit yearn  sometin a priori true about de way events dey related), den dis go deny e very own thesis say empirical knowledge gats invariably dey hypothetical knowledge, as e go come make room for discipline like economics wey claim to produce priori valid empirical knowledge. Still on de matta, de empiricist thesis say economic phenomena gats dey conceived as observable and measurable magnitudes—analogous to dose of de natural sciences—dey rendered inconclusive on e own account, for empiricism dey provide us wit meaningful empirical knowledge wen e inform us say our economic concepts dey grounded for observations. Howeva, de concepts of observation and measurement, wey empiricism gats employ to dey claim wetin e dey do, demselves nor dey obviously derived from observational experience in de sense say concepts like hens and eggs or apples and pears be. Person nor fit observe somebody wey dey make observation or measurement. Rada, person gats first understand wetin observations and measurements be in order to be able to interpret certain observable phenomena as de making of observation or the taking of  measurement. As e be so, contrary to e own doctrine, empiricism dey compelled to admit say  empirical knowledge dey wey dey based on understanding—just like wetin we own intuitions economic propositions claim to dey based on understanding rada dan on observations.[^8]

Rothbard, Individualism and the Philosophy of the Social Sciences (San Francisco: Cato Institute, 1979); for splendid philosophical critique of empiricist economics see Martin Hollis and Edward Nell, Rational Economic Man (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975); for particularly valuable defenses for rationalism against empiricism and relativism—wey nor get reference to economics—see Brand Blanshard, Reason and Analysis (La Salle, Ill.: Open Court, 1964); Friedrich Kambartel, Erfahrung und Struktur.

Regarding historicism, e self-contradictions no even reduce. If, as historicism claim, historical and economic events, wey e conceive of as sequences of subjectively understood rada dan observed events, nor dey governed by constant, time-invariant relations, den dis very proposition also nor fit claim to yearn anytin constantly true about history and economics. Instead, e go be proposition wit fleeting truth value: e fit be true now, if we wish, yet fit dey false in a moment, in case we nor do, and no one go eva know whether we do or do not. Howeva, this na de status of de basic historicist premise, e go obviously nor qualify as epistemology. Historicism nor for fit give us any reason why we go believe any of am. If, howeva, de basic proposition of historicism dey assumed to dey invariantly true, den dat kind proposition about de constant nature of historical and economic phenomena go contradict e own doctrine denying any such constants. To go forward, de historicist’s (and even more so e modern heir, de hermeneutician’s) claim say historical and economic events na mere subjective creations, wey nor dey constrained by any objective factors, don dey proven false by de very statement wey make am. Evidently, a historicist gats assume say dis very statement dey meaningful and true; he gats presume to say something specific about sometin, rada dan merely to dey utter meaningless sounds such as abracadabra. Howeva, if dis na de case, clearly e statement gats dey assumed to dey constrained by sometin outside de realm of arbitrary subjective creations. Of course, I fit yearn wetin de historicist yearn for English, German, Chinese, or any oda language I wish, and in so far historic and economic expressions and interpretations fit dey regarded as mere subjective creations. But whateva I yearn for whatever language I choose gats dey assumed to dey constrained by some underlying propositional meaning of my statement, wey be  de same for any language, and dey exist completely independent of whateva de peculiar linguistic form fit be for where e dey expressed. Contrary to historicist belief, de existence of dat kind  constraint nor be the one wey person go fit dispose of am at will. Rada, even dey objective for wetin we fit understand am to be de logically necessary presupposition for yearning anytin wey dey meaningful at all, as opposed to merely producing meaningless sounds. De historicist nor fit claim to say anytin if  nor b say the fact say e expressions and interpretations dey actually constrained by laws of logic as de very presupposition of meaningful statements as such.[^9]

With dis kind refutation of empiricism and historicism, Mises notice say, de claims of rationalist philosophy don dey successfully reestablished, and de case don dey for de possibility of a priori true statements, as dose of economics dey be like e wan be. Truly, Mises explicitly regards e own epistemological investigations as de continuation of de work of western rationalist philosophy. With Leibniz and Kant he don stand opposite the tradition of Locke and Hume.[^10] He dey take Leibniz’s side wen he dey answer Locke’s famous dictum “nothin dey for de intellect wey neva dey before for de senses” with e equally famous one “except de intellect itself”. And e recognize e task as a philosopher of economics as strictly analogous to dat of Kant’s wey be philosopher of pure reason (i.e., of epistemology). Like Kant, Mises wan demonstrate de existence of true a priori synthetic propositions, or propositions wey e be say e truth values fit dey definitely established, even tho for that kind undertaking de means of formal logic dey insufficient and observations dey unnecessary.

Dis kind criticism of empiricism and historicism don prove de general rationalist claim. Even don prove say we indeed get knowledge wey nor dey derived from observation yet dey constrained by objective laws. In fact, we own refutation of empiricism and historicism contain data kind priori synthetic knowledge. Yet wetin dey about de constructive task of showing say de propositions of economics—like de law of marginal utility and de quantity theory of money—qualify as dis type of knowledge? In order to do like dat, Mises don notice say in accordance wit de strictures wey dey traditionally formulated by rationalist philosophers, economic propositions gats fulfill two requirements. First, e gats dey possible to demonstrate say dem nor dey derived from observational evidence, for observational evidence go fit only reveal tins as dem happen to be: nothing dey wey go  indicate why tins gats dey de way dem be. Instead, economic propositions gats dey shown to dey grounded for reflective cognition, for we own understanding of ourselves as knowing subjects. Second, dis reflective understanding gats yield certain propositions as self-evident material axioms, nor be for de sense say dat kind axioms suppose dey self-evident for psychological sense, dat is, say person gats dey aware of dem or say dia truth dey depend on  psychological feeling of conviction. On de contrary, like Kant before am, Mises don stress de  fact say e dey usually much more painstaking to discover that kind axioms dan e dey to discover some observational truth like say de leaves of trees dey green or say I be 6 foot 2 inches.[^11] Rada, wetin make dem self-evident material axioms na de fact say nobody fit deny dia validity without self-contradiction, for to attempt to deny dem person done already presuppose dia validity.

[^11]: See Immanuel Kant, *Kritik der reinin Vernunft*, in idem, *Werke*, 12 vols., ed. W. Weischedel (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1968), vol. 3, p. 45; Ludwig von Mises, *Human Action: A Treatise on Economics* (Chicago: Regnery, l966), p. 38.

Mises don point out say both requirements dey fulfilled by wetin he call the axiom of action (i.e., de proposition say humans act, say dem dey display intentional behavior).[^12] E clear say, dis axiom nor dey derived from observation—na only bodily movements dey to observe but notin like actions—but dey come instead from reflective understanding. And dis understanding concern self-evident proposition, for e truth nor fit dey denied, since de denial gats dey  categorized as an action. But dis nor dey trivial? And wetin  economics get to do with dis? Of course, e dey previously recognized say economic concepts like prices, costs, production, money, and credit get sometin to do with de fact say dem be people wey dey act. But dat and how all of economics fit dey grounded in and reconstructed based on dat kind trivial proposition, nor clear at all. Na one of Mises’s greatest achievements to don show precisely say  insights dey implied for dis psychologically speaking trivial axiom of action wey demselves nor dey psychologically self-evident as well; and say na dese insights wey dey provide de foundation for de theorems of economics as true a priori synthetic propositions.

[^12]: On de following see in particular Mises, *Human Action*, chap. IV; Murray N. Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State* (Los Angeles: Nash, 1962), chap. 1.

E certainly nor dey psychologically evident say wit every action wey actor dey pursue one goal, and dat whateva de goal fit be, de fact say na actor dey pursue am reveal say he go don place relatively higher value on am dan on any oda goal of action wey he for don think of at de start of e action. E nor dey clear say in order to achieve his most highly valued goal an actor gats interfere or decide not to interfere (which na also an intentional interference) at an earlier point for time so as to produce a later result, nor be say e dey clear say dat kind interference go invariably imply de employment of some scarce means—at least dose of de actor body, e standing room, and de time wey de action absorbed. E nor dey self-evident say dese means gats also get value for an actor—a value wey dey derived from dat of de goal—bcos de actor must regard dia employment as necessary in order to effectively achieve de goal; and dat actions go fit dey performed only sequentially and always involve de choice of taking up dat one course of action wey at some given time go promise de most highly valued results to de actor and excluding at de same time de pursual of oda, less highly valued goals. E nor dey automatically clear say as a consequence of having to choose and give preference to one goal over anoda—as e nor dey able to realize all goals simultaneously—each and every action implies say de incurrence of costs (forsaking de value wey attach to de most highly ranking alternative goal wey nor fit dey realized or wey de realization gats dey deferred) bcos de means necessary to attain it dey bound up for de production of anoda, even more highly valued goal. Finally, e nor dey evident say for example starting point every goal of action gats dey be considered worth more to de actor dan e cost and capable of yielding a profit (a result wey de value dey ranked higher dan dat of de foregone opportunity), and say every action dey also invariably threatened by de possibility of loss if an actor find out for retrospect say contrary to e expectations de result wey e actually achieve get lower value dan de relinquished alternative suppose get.

All of dese categories wey we know to be de very heart of economics—values, ends, means, choice, preference, cost, profit and loss—dey implied for de axiom of action. Like de axiom ieself, dem nor dey derived from observation. Rada, say person dey able to interpret observations in terms of such categories requires say person don already knows wetin e means to act. Nobody wey nor be actor go ever understand dem, as dey nor dey “given”, ready to dey observed, but observational experience idey cast for disterms as e dey construed by an actor. Even more, while dem and dia interrelations nor dey obviously implied for de action axiom, once it don dey explicit say and how dem dey implied, person nor go get any difficulty recognizing dem as being a priori true for de same sense as de axiom itself is. Any attempt to disprove de validity of wetin Mises don reconstruct as implied for de very concept of action gats dey aimed at a goal, requiring means, excluding Oracle courses of action, incurring costs, subjecting de actor to de possibility of achieving or not achieving de goal wey e desire, and leading to a profit or a loss. So, e dey clearly impossible to dispute or falsify de validity of Mises’s insights. In fact, a situation wey e be say de categories of action go cease to get real existence fit itself neva dey observed or spoken of, as making an observation or speaking na also actions.

All true economic propositions, and na wetin praxeology dey all about and wetin Mises’s great insight consists of, fit dey deduced by means of formal logic from dis incontestably true material knowledge regarding de meaning of action and e categories. More precisely, all true economic theorems dey consist of (a) an understanding of de meaning of action, (b) a situation or situational change—assumed to be given or identified as being given—and  dey described in terms of action-categories, and (c) logical deduction of de consequences—again in terms of such categories—wey suppose  result for actor from dis situation or situational change. For instance, de law of marginal utility[^13] dey follow from we own indisputable knowledge of de fact say every actor dey always prefers wetin go satisfy am more over wetin go satisfy am less, plus de assumption say he dey faced with an increase for de supply of a good (a scarce mean) wey energy units he dey regard as of equal serviceability by one additional unit. From dis e go  follow with logical necessity say dis additional unit go fit only dey employed as a means for de removal of uneasiness wey dey deemed less urgent dan de least valuable goal wey dey previously satisfied by a unit of such a good. Provided no flaw dey for de process of deduction, de conclusions wey economic theorizing go yield gats dey valid a priori. Dese propositions’ validity dey ultimately go back to de indisputable axiom of action. To think, as empiricism dey do, say dese propositions require continual empirical testing for dia validation dey absurd and na sign of outright intellectual confusion. And e no dey less absurd and confusing to believe, as historicism dey do, say economics get notin to say about constant and invariable relations but dey merely deal wit historically accidental events. To say so na to prove say such statement dey wrong, as saying anytin meaningful at all go already presupposes acting and a knowledge of de meaning of de categories of action.
