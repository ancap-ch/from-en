Yet Rothbard nor dey content afta im develop full economic defense for pure market system. As im reach de end of im second biggest work wey be De Ethics of Liberty for 1982, im still go ahead to give us ogbonge system of ethics wey help complete de task to justify laissez faire.

Mises, togeda with some social scientists, accept de Humean verdict wey say reason fit be and e fit nor pass de slave of passions. Dat is to say reason abi science nor fit do more dan make e inform us weda certain means dey appropriate make e bring certain result abi end abi e nor dey appropriate at all.  E dey beyond de powers of reason, sha, make im teach us wich end make we choose abi wich end fit or nor fit dey justified. Ultimately, de ends wey dem choose dey artbitrary from a scientific point of view; na matter of emotional whims dem be. If we wan dey sure Mises, just like oda Economist, dey committed to one kin utilitarianism lik dat. E favour life over say make person die, e favour health over sickness, e favour abundance ova poverty. And insofar as far as dat kin tin end, de real goal wey dem use achieve de highest possible standard of living for everybody, na oda people dey share am, as e assume say dem dey, as an economic scientist Mises recommend say de correct course of action wey dem suppose choose na de policy of laissez-faire.[^9] And doubtlessly, as far as economics fit talk plenty tins lik dis, de case for laissez-faire na very important one. However, what if people nor consider prosperity make e be dia ultimate goal?As Rothbard take point out, economic analysis only show day laissez-faire go lead to higher standard of living as time dey go on. As time dey go, however, person go still die. Why e go cum dey quiet reasonable make person argue say while person agree wit everything wey economics talk, person go still dey concerned about im welfare as time dey go and for dere, nor economist go fit deny am, abi na subsidy go be de nicest tin? Moreover, why social welfare go be de first concern of person as time dey go? Shey people nor fit advocate poverty, weda na as ultimate value abi as a means wey dem go use bring out ultimate value like equality? De answer, of course, na say dem make dat kin proposal. However, anytime wey dem dey, nor be say economics nor get anytin to talk, but according to Mises with oda utilitarians, dem say nortin more dey wey dem fit talk at all, since no reasonable, scientific way dey wey dem fit use choose between values wey dey conflicting, since all of dem dey ultimately arbitrary.[^10]

Against dis position Rothbard cum takes side wit de philosophical tradition of rational ethics wey claim say reason dey capable make e yield cognitive value statements wey dey  regarded to proper ends of man.[^11] More specifically, he cum align imsef wit de natural  law abi natural rights  tradition of philosophic thoughts wey hold say universally valid norms fit dey discerned wit reasons as dem take dey for grounded for de nature of man. [^12] De Ethics of Liberty cum present de full case wey dey de libertarian property norms as de real rules.

(Baton Rouge: Louisiana State University Press, 1985).

If we wan agree with Rothbard on top de possibility wey dey rational ethic and, more specifically, on top de fact say only libertarian ethics go dey morally justified, I propose approach wey dey different and wey dey non-natural wey dem go take use establish dis two claims wey dey related. E don turn to common quarrel wit d natural rights  position, even for de part of readers wey dey sympathetic,  say de concept of human nature dey "too diffuse and e dey varied make e provide determinate set of contents of natural law”.[^13] Furthermore, im description of rationality dey equally ambiguous bcus e nor dey as if e distinguish between de role of reason wey e establish empirical law of nature for one hand and normative law of human conduct for anoda hand.[^14] Avoiding dat kin difficulties from de beginning, I claim say de following approach go dey more straightforward and rigourous as regards were e start from and de method wey e use derive conclusions. Moreover, as I go take explain later, my approach even dey more inline wit Rothbard own when e cum to say we wan justify de specific norms wey dey libertarianism  instead of de vague methodological  prescription wey natural right theorist do.[^15]

[^14]: Check de discussion wey dey inside Veatch, Human Rights, pp. 620–67.

[^15]: As I take disassociate mysef comot from de natural rights tradition nor mean say I nor fit agree wit de critical assessment of most of de contemporary ethical theory- in fact I agree wit Veatch’s complementary refutation of all desire—(teleological, utilitarian) ethics even wit all duty (deontological) ethics (ibid., chap. 1). And nor be say I claim say e no dey possible make dem interpret my own approach as de one wey dey fall  for "rightly conceived" natural rights tradition afterall (check inside footnote 17 below). Wetin I claim, be say de following approach dey  out of line wit wetin de natural rights approach don turn to, and say e nor owe anytin to dis tradition as e take dey lik dis.

Make I start by asking say wetin dey wrong wit de position wey Mises take and wit many odas wey de choice between dem de values dey ultimately arbitrary? First, make we note say dat kin position dey assume  say at least  de question of say weda or not value judgement abi normative statement go dey justified na cognitive problem. If to say dem nor assume am, Mises no go fit talk wetin e dey talk abi wetin e dey claim say na em be de case. Em position nor fit exist as arguable intellectual position.

For de begining of details, dis one nor fit take person very far. Indeed, e still look like far cry from dis insight to de proof  say dem fit justify normative and say na only de libertarian ethic dem fit defend. Dis impression dey wrong, however, dem don already win plenty for here pass wetin person suspect. De argument show us say any truth wey dem claim, de claim wey dey connected wit any proposition wey be true, objective abi valid (we fit use any one wey we want), and dem must raise and settle am as de argument take dey go. Since we nor fit dispute say na like dis e dey (person nor fit communicate and argue say person nor fit communicate and argue), and since we fit assume say everybody know wetin e mean to claim say sumtin na true (person nor fit deny dis statement unless e claim say de opposite na true), de way dem dey call dis fact na "the a priori of communication and argumentation."[^16]

[^16]: check K.O. Apel, “Das Apriori der Kommunikationsgemeinschaft und die Grundlagen der Ethik”, in idem, Transformation der Philosophie (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1973), vol. 2; also Jürgen Habermas, “Wahrheitstheorien”, in Helmut Fahrenbach, ed., Wirklichkeit und Reflexion (Pfullingen: Neske, 1974); idem, Theorie des kommunikativen Handelns (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1981), vol. 1, pp. 44ff.; idem, Moralbewusstsein und kommunikatives Handeln (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1983).

Arguing nor consist of free-floating propositions wey dey claim say na true e be. Instead, argument na activity wey dey always  go on, too. However, as per say dem dey raise and settle truth claims  for inside argument and say argument, aside from anytin wey e be wey dem talk for de course, na practical affair, e follow say intersubjectively meaningful norms must exist— especially de ones wey turn some action into argumentation— wey get special cognitive status as per say dem be de practical  preconditions  of  objectivity  and truth.

And so, person go reach de conclusion say dem must assume say dos norms dey justifiable as valid. E dey impossible make we argue odawise, bcus de ability wey person go argue lik dat go in fact presuppose de validity of dos norms wey underlie any argument. In contradistinction to de natural rights theorists, though, person go see say de answer to de question of wich ends dem fit abi dem fit nor justify nor fit dey deduced  from de narrower one of de argument.[^17] Wit dis, de peculiar role of reason wey dem go use determine de contents of ethics wey dem fit give precise description. Contrary to de role of reason wey dem fit use establish empirical laws of nature, wey dem fit use determine moral law reason fit claim to yield results wey dem fit show say na valid a priori. E only make explicit de tin wey dem  don already imply for de concept of argumentation, and if dem wan analyse any actual norm proposal em task dey confined to analyse weda or not e dey logically consistent wit dey ethics wey de proponent must presuppose as valid as far as e go fit make em proposal at all.[^18]

[^17]: Of course, since de capability of argumentation na essential feature of human being - person nor fit talk anytin about de latter witout de former - dem fit also argue say norms wey dem nor fit defined effectively as de argumentation nor dey compatible wit human nature.

[^18]: Methodologically, dis approach get close resemblance to wetin Gewirth don describe as de "dialectically necessary method" (Reason and Morality, pp. 42-47) - a method of a priori reasoning wey dem model after de Kantian idea of transcendental deductions. Unfortunately sha, for em important study Gewirth choose de wrong point wey he suppose start for em analyses. He attempt make e derive ethical system from dat action instead of from de concept of argumentation. Upon dat, dis one nor fit work, bcus from de correct face wey dem state say for action an agent must, thru necessity, presuppose de existence of certain values abi goods, e nor folo say dat kin goods dey universalizable and so, make odas respect am as de goods of de agent by right. Gewirth fit don notice de ethical "neutrality" of action had it been he nor dey painfully aware of de existence of de "pure science of action" abi "praxeology" wey dey in existence as Mises take espouse am. Incidentally, de awareness of praxeology fit don spare am from many mistakes wey dem derive from em faulty distinction wey dey between might “basic”, “additive” and “non-subtractive” goods (ibid., pp. 53–58). Rather, de idea of truth abi of universalizable rights or goods go only show wit argumentation as special subclass of actions, but nor be wit action lik dat, as dem clearly  reveal wit de fact say Gewirth, too, nor dey engaged for action but more specifically for argumentation if e wan convince us of de necessary truth wey dey em ethical system. However, as dem don recognise argumentation as de one and only starting point for de dialectically necessary method, a libertarian (as in, de one wey nor be Gewirthian) ethic follows, as we go take see.

::::On to de faultiness wey Gewirth’s wan take use derive universalizable rights from de notion of action, make you check de perspective remarks wey Alasdair MacIntyre do, After Virtue: A Study in Moral Theory (London: Duckworth, 1981), pp. 64–65; Habermas, Moralbewusstsein und kommunikatives Handeln, pp. 110–11; and Veatch, Human Rights, pp. 159–60.

But wetin be de strictures of ethics wey dem imply for argumentation wey be say dem nor fit dispute em validity  bcus if dem dispute am, e go implicitly presuppose  am? Quite normally dem don observe say argumentation imply  say one proposition dey claim universal  acceptability abi shey na norm proposal  make e be “universalizable”. As dem apply for norm proposals,  na de idea be dis, wey dem form for inside de Golden Rule of ethics or inside de Kantian Categorical  Imperative, say na only de  norms wey fit dey justified,  na im dem fit form as general principles wey dey valid for everybodi.[^19]As dem don tok for argumentation say everybodi wey fit understand wetin dem dey argue gats gree say e dey correct becos of wetin dem call argumentative force,we fit come understand and explain de universalization Principle of ethics becos na priori of communication and argumentation.[^20] But dis universalization principle na just to provide person  wit pure meaning of morality. To dey sure, all dem proposals for  correct norms wey go specify different kind rules for different people dem fit dey shown say e no get legit claim say e dey universally acceptable as correct norms, unless say de difference between different people dem na say discrimination no go dey but e go dey accepted as wetin  dey nature of everybody. But still, even as say some kind norms no pass test of universalization, if we give better attention to how dem bin carry form dem, d norms wey no even make sense(and dose norms wey really make sense) fit pass the test. For example, "everybodi gats dey high on Sundays or else im go pay money" or "anybodi wey drink alcohol go dey  punished" na both rules wey no allow make discrimination dey among people dem and so we fit claim say dem dey satisfy de condition of   universalization. 

[^19]: See de works wey dey for footnotes 11 and 12 above.

[^20]: See de works wey dey for footnote 16 above.

As e clear reach, e mean say de universalization principle nor go fit provide person wit any kind better norms wey we fit tok say e dey justified. But e get some kind oda beta norms wey dey inside argumentation wey no be universalization principle. For us to fit see demz e dey important to remember dis three facts wey dey related. De first one be say argumentation no just be cognitive affair but e dey practical. Second one be say, argumentation as form of action na de use of scarce resource wey dey person body. And de third one be say argumentation na conflict-free way to carry relate wit person—no be say agreement dey for everytin wey person tok, but say as far as say argumentation dey go on, e dey possible to gree say at least disagreement dey ontop wetin  dem don tok.Dis one mean say person gats know say control over im own body dey as long as say argumentation dey(note say e dey impossible to deny dis den come tok say e dey true wen u never gree say na truth).

So, person go get conclude say de norm wey dem tok for argumentation mean say everybodi get de right to control im  own body as im instrument of action and cognition. And na only as long as say at least  person Sabi say na im get im own property, wey argumentation fit dey.[^21] Only if this right is recognized is it possible for someone to agree to what has been said in an argument and can what has been said be validated, or is it possible to say no and to agree only on the fact that there is disagreement. Indeed, anyone who would try to justify any norm would have to presuppose the property right in one’s body as a valid norm, simply in order to say this is what I claim to be true and objective. Anybodi wey no gree wit de property right ontop person body go find out say im no gree wit wetin im don tok.

[^21]: E fit dey noted say na only becos say scarcity dey na im mk wahala dey to form moral laws; as far as say de goods plenti, wahala no fit dey ova de use of goods and no need to dey control action. So e mean say any ethic wey dey correct, gats dey formed as theory of property, dat is theory of de assignment of rights wey dey to control scarce means, becos na only how e go dey possible to stop wahala wey we no fit escape or solve. But moral philosophers as del no sabi anytin for economics neva  see dis mata lyk dis. But lyk Veatch (Human Rights, p. 170), for example,dem think say dem fit just forget about correct definition of property and property rights and na im make dem dey lyk say dem dey tok wetin no clear atall. .

::::for human rights as property rights see also Rothbard, The Ethics of Liberty, chap. 15.

E mean say we fit tok say wen person tok say some kind statement fit dey justified, im mean say de norm wey be "nobodi get right to aggress against anoda person body wey  go stop dat person to get control ova im own body" dey justified. We fit see dis rule for inside wetin dem call argumentative justification. Justifying mean say to justify sometin wen force no dey. In fact, if person form opposite for dis rule(dat is everybodi get d right to uninvitedly aggress against oda people [ rule, wey be say e go pass, de universalization test!]) den e dey easy to see say dis rule no dey and no fit dey defended wen argumentation dey. To defend am go mean say de opposite rule dey correct.(dat is de principle of agression wey we don mention before).

E fit dey lyk say wit dis justification of a property norm wey concern person body, plenty winning no dey,compare to conflicts wey dey ontop bodies, wey be say de non aggression principle don form solution, na im make up de small part of conflicts wey dey. But dis mata no dey correct. To dey sure, people no dey live for air and for love only. Dem follow need, smaller or greater numba of oda goods wey dem go carry live— and na only person wey fit live, na im fit continue dey argue, or even live better life. Wit respect to all dis, oda good norms dey wey we follow need,  becos we fit reach wia we  go confuse de meaning. In fact, any oda norm gats dey in line wit de nonagression principle so e go fit dey justified and every norm wey no dey in line wit dis Principle no go dey correct. To add to wetin we don tok, as de tins wey we dey form dis norms for na scarce goods—just lyk person body na scarce good—and e dey only important to form norm becos goods dey scarce,no be say na becos body na special kind of scarce goods, de specification of de nonagression principle, wey be special property norm wey dey for special type of good, gats get wetin dey inside general theory of property.

I go first talk about de theory of general property as mata wey really make sense to all goods, with de goal wey be to try stop any kind wahala by de use of principles wey dey de same, den I go come show how dis general theory carry relate with de nonaggression principle. As de nonagreession principle don talk, person fit do anytin wey im want with im body as far as say im nor go cos Wahala for anoda person body. So, dat person fit make use of oda scarce means just lyk person fit use im own body, as far as say anoda person neva touch am but e still dey  normal as e bin dey. Wen dis scarce resources don dey correct—dis one mean say as soon as person don mix im labour with am, as John Locke bin talk, and e dey show— den property(de right to dey in control) fit only dey wen transfer of property titles from person wey bin get am to new person, and anytin wey try to stop dis control of de person wey bin get am or anytin wey try to  change how d scarce means dey, nor dey in line with person aggression against anoda person body, wey be action wey nor make sense.[^23]

[^23]: On de nonaggression principle and de principle of original appropriation see also Rothbard, For A New Liberty, chap. 2; idem, The Ethics of Liberty, chaps. 6–8.

De compatibility of dis principle with de one  of nonaggression fit dey demonstrated if we use  wetin dem call argumentum a contario. First, we gats note say if nobody bin get de right to get or control sometin except im own body (wey be say na rule wey go pass de formal universalization test), den we go  just stop to dey live and de wahala of justification of statements wey dey normal nor go even dey. Dis problem fit dey, only if we dey live, and we dey live cos of de fact wey be say  we nor fit, accept wetin nor support property wey dey, oda scarce goods wey dey next to or wey fit  dey added to person body. So we gats assume say, de right to get dose kind goods dey. And, if na so and if person nor get de right to get dose kind right to get control over wetin person neva use before, wetin nature don give person through im work (wey be by to do sometin with things wey person neva do anytin with before), and if oda people get right to dey yab person wey claim to own sometin wey im no work on or use before, den e go only dey possible if person fit get property titles even if im no labour(as in, like say person form link between person and de scarce resource), but by to use wetin dem call simple declaration or decree.[^24] But still, de position of dis property titles wey  we fit get through declaration no dey in line wit wetin we don prove above for de non-aggression principle as we dey talk about body. If we wan look am well, if person fit confirm property by decree, e go mean say e dey possible for person to just talk say anoda person body na im own. E dey clear well well say, dis Wahala with de ruling of dis nonaggression principle wey make big difference between person body and anoda person body. If we wan continue, dis difference fit only happen for very simple and small way becos for body, as e be for anytin atall,de separation wey dey between "mine and yours" no dey based on declaration wey dem tok for mouth, but na for action. De observation dey based ontop some kind resource wey dey—infact mek everybody follow confirm cos some kind objective indicators bin dey— as expression or sometin to show say e fit be person will or; of anoda person will. E follow dey important to talk say we fit get property with no action but we fit get am through declaration wey go involve sometin wey nor make sense atall cos no person fit talk, come declare so, unless say im right of exclusive control ova im body as im own wey im go carry talk anytin na just ordinary talk, wey nor dey de same wit wetin we don talk already. 

[^24]: Na wetin Jean-Jacques Rousseau mean, wen im tok say make we try to avoid wetin go  make us accept things wey nature don  give us for example to fence am inside. He talk for wetin he dey like talk say; “Make we try nor listen to dis person wey dey try deceive us, say we nor do well if we know say wetin dey ground na we get am and de ground nobody get am" (“Discourse upon the Origin and Foundation of Inequality Among Mankind”, in Jean-Jacques Rousseau, The Social Contract and Discourses, ed. G.D.H. Cole [New York: 1950], p. 235). But if we wan talk so, we go assume say property claims fit dey justified by decree. How e go be say all( even dose wey nor do anytin wit wetin dem get) or nobody (even dose wey use wetin dem get)na im get sometin unless say property claims bin come dey by ordinary decree?

As I don talk before, dis defense of private property na Rothbard talk am. Even with im formal agreement to de natural rights tradition, Rothbard  in wetin I fit call im most crucial argument, as im dey try defend private property ethic, im nor only choose de same starting point but e also give some kind justification with de means wey be priori reasoning wey dey almost same with de one wey don dey. To prove dis point, l nor fit do anytin but to quote; :

> Now, any person wey dey involved in any kind talk, including de ones wey dey tok of values, dey involved, dey live, and im dey confirm say im dey live. cos if im dey against life, im for nor get anytin to do with life. So de person wey dey claim say im dey against life dey confirm am, as im dey try talk of am, and so, as person life take dey safe and preserved, nor fit be something wey person go dey argue.[^25]
