## Against Fiduciary Media

Almost all Austrian economists nowadays dey united for dia opposition for central banking and for dia support of banking system wey dey free and competitive. But, strong  debate don start on top de original meaning of “banking wey dey free and competitive”. Shey “free banking” nid 100-percent-reserve-deposit banking, abi na only  fractional reserve banking wey e fit allow or nid? For inside one article like dat wey show for de Review of Austrian Economics, George A. Selgin and Lawrence White, de two correct people wey study and come support de latest Austrian “free banking” since fractional reserve banking, don undertake systematic attempt wey dem go use answer dem plenty Austrian critics togeda with defender dem of 100-percentreserve-deposit banking.[^1]

Against de charges wey dem critics go make, Selgin and White don try to prove two theses like dat. First, dem claim to show say de practice of fractional reserve banking, wey be, de issue of fiduciary media, nor involve fraud but e dey justified by de principle of freedom of contract, and again dem argue say fractional reserve banking dey de same line with de title-transfer theory of contract wey  Murray N. Rothbard  develop (so tey Rothbard, who agree say fractional reserve banking na lie, don fail to even understand im own theory). Second, dem try to show say de creation of fiduciary media nor go lead to economic inefficiencies and discoordination by force but e fit help dem stop wahala wey be say he nor dey possible to stop before and dis one go improve economic performance well well. For inside de following, we go show say both central normative claim and secondary positive claim nor dey before

### De Wahala of Fraud I: Money, Money Substitutes, Fiduciary Media, togeda with Title-Transfer Theory of Contract

If we wan answer de question weda fractional reserve banking dey cause fraud or he nor dey cause, from de beginning we nid to explain some correct tori and terminological issues. But as we get luck reach, both de two side agree for de same matter, so cos of dat one we go dey brief well well. Money fit show for many form, just like Gold. If we take Gold as money, den we fit talk say money na de medium of exchange wey everybody accept”, so dat one go make us fit talk say "if we compare am to oda load, gold get value pass dem” (so tey “person fit use am buy anytin without any wahala”).[^3] Money substitutes, to put am anoda, fit be claims or titles for some kind amount of money wey be gold. If reserves of money (gold)  cover money substitute dem (paper notes), Mises dey call money substitute “money certificates”, and we go dey call them money substitutes for dis work. If money substitutes (paper notes) dey uncovered with money (gold), we go dey call dem fiduciary media.[^4]

On top dese assumptions with definition, we go fit answer de question of weda fraud dey inside Fiduciary Media now or not. But as we get luck reach de discussion on top this tori happen cos Selgin and White agree  say Rothbardian title transfer theory of contract dey correct. Since de issue say fiduciary media dey fraudulent, just like  Rothbard togeda with Hoppe claim, Selgin and White dey find 

> am hard to agree with Rothbard's title-transfer-theory of contract wey we agree on top, and wey Rothbard take use defend people make dem start private business with deir property wey dem get through correct way. Rothbard come talk say fraud na "failure to fulfill agreement wey dem use transfer property without force." So we fit talk say fractional-reserve arrangements na fraud. Weda one bank dey commit fraud by holding fractional reserves go depend on de terms of title-transfer agreement wey dey between de bank and dia customers.[^5]...

> Weda e dey fraudulent make we hold fractional reserves against  bank liability nor depend weda na demand abi time liability, but only on weda de bank don misrepresent imself say im dey hold 100 percent reserves. De demandability of one particular claim wey bank give, as in, de contractual option wey de holder fit collect at anytime, nor be representation say de bank dey hold 100 percent reserves against all of de claims wey dem fit demand. Rothbard come argue say, based on de view say bank dey like demand deposits with notes, dis one na confirm “warehouse receipts” nor be debts. We nor see reason why bank and dia customer nor fit agree with contract so dat dem go fit make dem debts instead of warehouse receipts, and we believe say historically dem don agree.[^6]

e fit sound like correct thing de first time, but e nor fit stand confam inspection. In fact, de passage wey dem quote show say dem don overlook de simple lesson wey concern property and contact. Just like Hoppe talk, "two people nor fit be de real owner of sometin wey be one de same time."[^7] Dis one na principle wey nor fit change; na law of action and nature wey no contract fit change or cancel. But, any contractual agreement wey involve say dem go present two different people as owners of de same tin (or we fit talk say, de same tin wey more dan one person get) na lie and e dey fraudulent.[^8] And dis na de fractional-reserve agreement wey dey between bank and dia customers.

If we wan issue and collect fiduciary note (with correct discounted price), bank and dia customer in fact, nor mata wetin dem believe or think about de transaction, don agree to represent dem sef - fraudulently- as de owner of one and de same object for de same time. Dem don come togeda to create anoda title and claim for de same existing quantity of property. If dem wan issue fiduciary note, dem nor dey do and dem nor fit bring plenty property into existence. So, no contract fit increase de existing quantity of property at all, but e fit transfer (redistribute) property wey don already dey ground from one person to anoda. De only way wey dem go fit increase de quantity of property wey don already dey ground na through addition of appropriation togeda with production (and so big quantity of property fit lead to de same increased number of titles for property). But fractional reserve banking with de issue of fiduciary media, wey nor dey and wey nor fit increase due to amount of property wey dey for existence, and again e nor involve (just like oda contracts be) transfer of existing property abi transfer of titles go existing property from one hand enter anoda. And de issue and acceptance of fiduciary note nor signify transfer of property from one bank to dia client or from one client to bank. If we wan dey sure well well, as de result of fiduciary issue dey, de distribution of assets and liabilities inside de accounts of bank and de client go dey altered. But existing quantity of property wey dem transfer from bank to dia client or from client to bank nor dey, and de total quantity of property wey dey, still remain as e dey. Instead, fiduciary media come represent new and additional titles to, or claims for stock of property wey dem neva change wey still dey exist. Dem nor be de result and documented outcome of additional supply of property for de part of de bank or dia client. Instead, dem represent additional supply of property titles, but de supply of property nor change. Na cos of dis we fit talk say dem create  fiduciary media from thin air. Dem be property-less titles wey dey search for property. Dis one na em be fraud, weda we follow Rothbard's definition say " failure wey dem go use fulfill transfer of property wey dem agree on" or according to Selgin and White definition say "na him be willful or deliberate deception for purpose of gain." every issuer and buyer of fiduciary note ( title to money, uncovered by money), weda person believe or not, na fact say dem engage am so dat misrepresentation go dey for purpose of personal gain. De bank and dia client dem don agree say dem go misrepresent demsef as de owners of a quantity of property wey dem nor get and wey nor even exist; and anytime wey dem buy existing quantity of property wey dem go use exchange titles for nonexisting quantity of property, dem don dey guilty of fraud.[^9]

With plenty questions, inside wetin dem ansa people wey nor support dem, Selgin and White bin choose tori wey Hans-Hermann Hoppe bin write as dia central target ("How Fiat Money go dey possible?— or De Devolution of Money and Credit",Review of Austrian Economics, no. 2(1994): 49—74), wey talk about dia position. Oda Austrian people wey nor support dis mata of fractional reserve banking bin follow get dia share of wahala inside wetin Selgin and White bin write, even Walter Block, "Fractional Reserve Banking: An interdisciplinary Perspective," in Man, Economy, and Liberty: Essays in Honor of Murray N. Rothbard, Walter Block and Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr. eds. (Auburn, Ala.:Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988) and Jesús Huerta de Soto, "A Critical Analysis of Central Banks And Fractional-Reserve Free Banking, from the Austrian Perspective," Review of Austrian Economics 8, no. 2(1995):25-36.But na indirectly wey dem target Murray N. Rothbard, wey be d main person wey nor support fractional reserve banking ; and even though dem mention plenty of him work for dia bibliography, wetin Rothbard’s later write on de mata(“The Myth of Free Banking in Scotland”, Review of Austrian Economics 2(1988): 229–57; idem, “Aurophobia: or, Free Banking on What Standard?” Review of Austrian Economics, 6, no. 1(1992): 97–108; idem, “The Present State of Austrian Economics”, Journal des Economistes et des Etudes Humaines 6, no. 2(1995)) nor dey mentioned.Anoda thing wey dem  ignore totally na de criticism wey Joseph T. Salerno do (“Two Traditions in Modern Monetary Theory: John Law and A.R.J. Turgot”, Journal des Economistes et des Etudes Humaines 2, no. 2/3(1991); idem, “The Concept of Coordination in Austrian Macroeconomics”, in Austrian Economics: Perspectives on the Past and Prospects for the Future, Richard Ebeling, ed. [Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 1991]; and idem, “Mises and Hayek Dehomogenized”, Review of Austrian Economics 6, no. 2(1993): 113–46). Selgin and White nor follow talk about, and true true for dis one dem nor fit, de mata wey Jörg Guido Hülsmann write against wetin dem tok for inside-(“Free Banking and the Free Bankers”, Review of Austrian Economics 9, no. 1(1996): 3–53).

[^2]: As mata wey be like wetin person must follow, Segin and White don follow talk say wetin dem see as fractional reserve banking follow join with wetin Ludwig von Mises see; so dem dey call demselves Misesians and dem talk say na people wey dey support 100-percent-reserve banking wey be deviationists. Dis tok fit dey rejected cos Selgin for inside (The theory of Free Banking: Money Supply under Competitive Note Issue[Totowa, N.J.: Rowman and Littlefield, 1988], pp.60—63) don gree say Mises with wetin him talk about fiduciary media nor dey de same and wetin White don talk about Mises as person  wey support fractional reserve banking don dey addressed by person wey be  Salerno ("Mises and Hayek Dehomogenized, Review Of Austrian Economics 6, no. 2(1993): 113—46). Here e dey enough to drop quote from Mises wey tok say:

> de main thing na say make e nor be say na government go dey increase de quantity of money wey dey in circulation and de amount of cheque-book money wey nor dey fully, dat is, 100 percent—covered by deposits wey don dey paid in by de public…. No bank go dey permitted to expand de total amount of wetin don dey paid in to cheque or de balance of wetin don dey paid in by any customer … unless e go be by to receive cash wey  customer go pay… or by to receive cheque wey  anoda domestic bank fit pay wey dey under d same limits. Dis one mean say na 100 percent go dey ground for all deposits wey customers go do as time dey go on; as in  all deposits wey nor dey on d first day wey change start. (The Theory of Money and Credit [Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic Education, 1978], pp. 438 and 48)

[^4]: See Salerno, “Ludwig von Mises’s Monetary Theory in Light of Modern Monetary Thought”, Review of Austrian Economics 8, no. 1 (1994): 71–115. Selgin and White don write down d fact wey be say Hoppe bin talk say dem be people wey dey support "partial Fiat money", but dem dey moved to gree say im bin nor dey wrong wen im tok say dem dey in support of fractional reserve banking based on some kind standard wey don dey ground. Wetin dem dey complain nor pass simple wahala wey dey for English sha.We go treat am  and we go concentrate on dose kind wahala.

For matter wey we dey consider we fit see say oda tins follow for tori wey tok say Segin and White dey support fiat money.
according to  Selgin and White, (but nor be as Mises say e supoose be)e get how things suppose be wey be say

> as condition dey, if we wan do inter-clearing house settlements with oda things wey dey ground,  (maybe mata wey concern superclearing house wey  on im own contain small money to buy something) and if de people wey dey outside nor fit hold money wey dem go use buy things, den people  nor go dey nid money to get wetin suppose nid money to buy.(Lawrence White, Competition and Currency [New York: New York University Press, 1989], p. 235)

so, notes wey Salerno write (“Ludwig von Mises’s Monetary Theory in Light of Modern Monetary Thought”, Review of Austrian Economics 8, no. 1(1994): 71–115, p. 76, n. 7) concerning wetin Selgin and White bin believe na say “de public go dey free finally from de bondage of gold wey go let dem enjoy d power of private fiat money wey we nor sabi who make am".But, as far as English dey change from de old Misesian Tori and confusion don dey set in, we go consider wetin Segin and White bin write. Dem say as we dey refer to money and wetin fit dey in place of money as "outside" and "inside" money, and as we dey talk of "basic money", "bank money", high-powered" and low-powered" money and de gold dollar as wetin fit dey in place of bank deposits, dem nor dey equal if we wan check dia meaning. But as dem don tok say all these tins na money, wetin dem write don bcome wetin dey confuse person. See for dis Hülsmann, “Free Banking and the Free Bankers”, pp. 5ff.

[^8]: Even partners nor fit own de same thing at de same time. A and B go fit get half household, or half of de shares wey dey de house but na only 50 percent each of dem fit get. E dey impossible make dem get d same half wey dey like make two people dey de same space Yes, A and B fit dey New York City at de same point in time but dem go dey different parts of New York City.

[^9]: Jesús Huerta de Soto (“A Critical Analysis of Central Banks”, p. 33) dey correct as im talk say wetin fractional reserve banking dey cause na same as wetin de so-called tragedy of commons fit cause. Selgin and White (“In Defense of Fiduciary Media”, pp. 92–93, n. 12)sha no agree with wetin de Soto don talk bcos dem feel say tragedy of de commons mean say, to a point na sometin wey involve some kind block for wetin person suppose produce or chop and e follow show how people dey relate for outside de market. As dem nor agree,  Selgin and White, don write say de “externality from fiduciary media” na sometin wey nor fit wound person wey dey rich and e dey transmitted through how price dey change and e dey show how de market dey depend on one anoda. Selgin and White don tok say : sometin wey be object and name wey dem give object nor be de same thing.


In lumping money and money substitutes together under the joint title of “money”, as if they were somehow the same thing, Selgin and White fail to grasp that the issue of fiduciary media—an increase of property titles—is not the same thing as a larger supply of property and that relative price changes effected through the issue of fiduciary media are an entirely different “externality” matter than price changes effected through an increase in the supply of property. With this the fundamental distinction between property and a property title in mind, de Soto’s analogy between fractional reserve banking and the tragedy of the commons makes perfect sense. As under the scenario of a tragedy of the commons, every issue of fiduciary media—to titles in search of property—sets in motion a rush, always starting with the bank and its client, to fill these empty tickets with existing property; and in the course of this rush, invariably the first-comers will physically enrich themselves (through the appropriation of existing quantities of property) at the expense of a corresponding impoverishment of later-comers, whose quantity of existing property is physically diminished while they have been left with a larger number of property tickets.

As dem join money and wetin fit dey in place of money under de same name of "money" as if dem be de same tin, Selgin and White neva see say dis matar of fiduciary media wey be – increase ontop property titles – nor be same tin as supply of property wey dey bigger and dem neva see say change for price wey don come as fiduciary media don dey nor be de same matter as wen price change ontop supply of property. With dis tori, de difference between property and property name wey person get for mind, wey be wetin de Soto don talk between fractional reserve banking with palava wey follow commons dey legit. As e be for palava wey follow commons,every mata wey concern fiduciary media—to titles wey dey find property go just bring rush wey go start with de bank and de customer, wey go fill de tickets wey dey empty wit property wey don dey ground; and as dis rush dey go on, people wey first come go just dey rich(cos of wetin don dey ground before) and people wey dey late go dey poor, since property wey go dey ground go don reduce and property tickets go still plenty well well.
