Na only one important element wey dey mess from complete reconstruction of de international order wey dey now: money. Na for de state's natural interest to expand im corner militarily; and so, make person expect tendency wey dey waka go relative concentration of states. Na also for de state own good to carry body enter "monetary imperialism" (as in to shift im counterfeiting power reach big big corner dem); and so  make dem expect one-world paper currency  to happen. De two interest and tendency dey complement each oda. For de one hand, any step wey dey waka go de direction of international counterfeiting cartel dem dey bound to fail if e nor dey complemented by de military dominance wey dem don set up and hierarchy. External and internal economic pressure dem go try to burst de cartel. With military on top, howeva, to inflate cartel go dey possible. For de oda hand, once military dominate come come make dat kind cartel possible, de dominant state go fit expand im exploitative power ova ode corner dem without war and conquest. In fact, de international cartelization of counterfeiting allow de dominant state to pursue through means wey dey sophisticated wella (as in wey nor too visible) wetin war and conquest alone fit nor achieve.

For de first step on dominant state (one state, wey fit crush anoda state with military and wey be like e dey capable to do like dat, by de government wey im dorminate in particular)  go use im superior power to enforce de policy of internationally coordinated inflation. Im own central bank dey set de pace inside de counterfeiting process, and de central banks of de dominated state dem dey get order to inflate with de state wey dey dominate. For practical terms, dem dey keep de dominating state paper currency as reserve currency on top foreign central banks dem, and dem dey pressured to use am as basis for dia own inflationary action.

As e nor dey constrained by actual demand but only public opinion, e dey relatively easy for dormant state to win im goal. Conquest for direct territory  and de direct implementation of im own currency for foreign territory dem go fit dey prohibitive  cos of de how national or foreign public opinion be. Yet as im get de power to destroy any particular foreign government —eve though e nor strong wella to do take over—na small thing wey de dominant state need to succeed for monetary imperialism.

For inside, e nor go face any resistance at all. De government im sef go like de solution. For once im own currency go enter work as reserve currency for foreign banks den dem go come pyramid dia national paper money on top am, den  e go come dey possible for am to carry body join inside almost costless expropriation of people wey get foreign property  and dose wey dey produce income with no consequence wey person fit fear. And na so, im own banking and business elite don dey ready to accept de agreement cos dem too go fit safely follow for foreign exploitation. Banks dem dey enthusiastic. And de public dey ignorant  of wetin dey happen, or dem consider to exploit foreigners as small thing compared to internal problems.

Externally, matas dey somehow complicated. De dominated state go lose resources to de dominating state as de consequence of monetary regime. But e dey face de possibility of of losing im internal control altogeda, e dey naturally prefer acquiescing to scheme we nor only allow am to stay for power but to continue for inside im fraudulent expropriation of im own population by to inflate im currency for on top and for accordance with de dominating state to create paper money. For essentially de same reason wey bank and big business men, as dose wey first receive de respective state counterfeit money,  dey willing to accept dis solution. And de general public  for de dominated territories, wey through arrangement na subject to double layer of exploitation of foreign state elite on top national state  and elite, dey unaware of all dis fact identify am as one important thing wey cause im own prolonged economic dependency and relative stagnation face to face with de dominant nation.

Dis first step, howeva nor provide beta solution. De international monetary system dey characterized by dominant paper currency, and plenty national paper money dem wey dey pyramid on top of am, and exchange rate wey dey free go up and down between dose type of currency dem.

For one hand, dis one nor reach satisfactory for de dominant state, cos unda all dis circumstances dem na plenty room wey dey for de possibility of im own currency to fall against odas, and dat kind development go be threat to im own role as dominant power. Nor be inflationary policy of some central banks we dey determine exchange rate. Ultimately and if things nor change , na purchasing power equality dey determine am.[^30] and even if say one dominated central bank inflate  on im own with de dominating central bank, oda factor dem (wey be lower level of taxation and regulation, for instance) go fit still make im currency appreciate against de one of de dominant state.

For de oda hand, de existence of plenty currency dem wey dey freely go up and down  against each oda na, as we explain before, dysfunctional of de very purpose of money. e be system of partial barter. E dey create informational chaos,  e dey make rational economic calculation to dey impossible, accordingly e dey lead to inefficiency for inside de very system of production wey de dominant state dey rest like parasite.

And so, for am to assure im dominant position and make im exploitatively appropriated income plenty, for anoda step dominant go invariably make attempt to institute international — abd ultimately universal— currency we dem dey control monopolistically and dey issue  eida directly by im own central bank or indirectly by im central bank to dominate international or world bank.

E get some obstacles wey dey for de road to get dis goal. Howeva, once de first step don complete, none of dem go dey hard to solve. Naturally, de dominated state  go lose discretional power for unda dis arrangement. But dis one go dey compensated for by de fact say im own economy go function wella, too if calculated wahala for inside international trade reduce. As de tori dey go, de banking and business elite for de two country go stand wella in favour of dat kind monetary regime and dem go use dia close ties to dia respective state and international  connection dem to promote im adoption. Afta all, bank and industrial firm dem also dey for de business of to make money through production and exchange dem. De exchange rate wey dey freely fluctuate na artificial road block for dis economic interest waka. And dem go look as dem nor dey perform well for de eye of big business dem, cos na for big business in particular wey foreign trade dey play beta role.

In fact de resistance to adopt international currency wey severe pass nor suppose come from de state or de economic elite dem but from de general public. As far as de international currency dey imply make dem give up de one wey dem already dey use, e dey run against de same  nationalism wey all state don build for so long. Dis one go be problem especially if dem ask de public for de dominated countries to adopr de dominant state dia currency directly—de name and every every— cos de underlying imperialist nature of dat kind monetary system go come dey dangerously clear. Yet with small diplomacy and patient propaganda, dis problem be like wetin dem fit solve too. New currency with new name must to dey in terms of national money wey don already dey exist, so dat e nor go cause nationalistic or anti-imperialist sentiments. Dis new currency must only use small thing pass de value of oda national money dem (wey in turn dey defined for de terms of de new currency) so dat im fit drive all na money dem comot for circulation (as de tori follow Gresham's law).[^31] Dis one must follow with de state and de economic elite dia constant appeal to de general public correct institution wey— even with all de nationalistic feelings— national money wey de go up and down on im own na wetin dem call anachronistic institution wey dey cripple rational economic calculation, and dat one na for de good of everybody to internationally  (and if e dry possblr universally) use money just like de international banking system for unda de leadership of de dominant state wey dia central bank go dey willing to provide. Dat way dem don bae any drastic change for public opinion wey dey waka for de direction of private property wey stand wella and sound money orientation and increased antistate vigilance as e follow de mata, nothing go stop de dominant state make e nor achieve dis complete international counterfeiting autonomy. And de world money and world bank don dey for de control of de dominant state dia central bank, e go take decisive step to reach im ultimate goal to establish im sef as full-scale world government, with world-wide control wey nor go only cover counterfeiting but e go also cover taxation and legal regulation.

As we dey look into dis explanation of monetary imperialism am im function as "natural" ( de way wey statist dem see am) complement of military expansionism,  de remaining pieces dem from de history of international politics don come fall into place. As e take waka hand in hand with Great Britain wen e rise to de rank of de most important imperialist nation, state come go for sterling imperialism. Dat time e nor be really dey free of some kind inside obstacle wey block counterfeiting, Country dem wey British government— been dominate been  dey compelled to keep dia reserve for de form of sterling balances for London, where de Bank Of England go redeem dem as gold. Na like dis way de country dem go pyramid dis national currency dem on top of pound, and Britain go fit inflate sterling notes on top of gold with no fear of say gold go outflow. As Britain decline and de U.S government come rise de same time to de position of de biggest military power for de whole world, dollar imperialism don use small small replace sterling imperialism. For de end of de World war II, as de U.S. domination come cover most part of d world, and as dem sign am for de Bretton Woods agreement, de dollar come become de world reserve currency, and na on top am wey all oda state dem don inflate dia different national paper money dem.[32] For some time de U.S  been still continue to pretend sey dem dey redeem de dollars for foreign central bank as gold, and dis one been nor let dem increase dia own inflationary potential. Howeva  e nor stop steady dollar counterfeiting on top of gold to dey happen. De position wey de U.S dey as militarily dominant international power ( for now e form through some military pact dem, just like NATO) allow am to fit force foreign government dem to use dia right to ask for small redemption, so dat im own dollar inflation go happen with no contractive consequences. And wen in counterfeiting policy been don push foreign government to begin grow shoulder for dia attempt to obtain gold for de price wey dem bargain, na de strength of de U.S military wey finally allow am to stop de pretense come go declare say im own note nor dey redeemable. since den de Federal Reserve System  don reach de position of autonomous counterfeiter of last resort to de whole international banking system.[^33]

De imperialist nature of dis dollar standard dey particularly take effect  through instrument like de International Monetary Fund (IMF), de International Vank of Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and de Bank Of International Settlement (BIS).[^34] Money and credit wey dem create just with one strike of pen dey pass from all dis U.S-dominated institution, e go first reach foreign government  wey dey inflate dia national currency dem on top am and just like dat dey shift dis money to dia caterlized banking system, to add more dose of counterfeiting  den give am to de favourit business establishment  of de various state from dere e go come spread reach de economic periphery. Sometin wey dey parallel to how dis money dey flow na reversed process of income and wealth redistribution wey start from de periphery to national business and banking elite dem and all de station state even as from de dominated territories to de U.S. government and de U.S. banking  and business establishment as de ultimate center of world finance.

From how dis mata be for sociology, de consequences dey interesting if de two processes for inside dey on top of pre-modern, feudal societies. Dose kind country, wey dey likely dey for Africa, Asia, Central and South America,  always dey characterized by feudal landlords-wey become-financial-or industrial-magnates wey dey control de state apparatus and dey mostly reside for de capital-city-and-seat-of-government; and with landless peasant dem wey full everywhere for de country side and dey sustain de state, de feudal elite and de capital city through de payment of land rent [^35]. Dis dollar imperialism here mean to support feudal rule, to support and participate for de exploitation of poor peasantry and de countryside with parasitic feudal  caste and de capital city, and to put hand to de suppression of any liberationist land reform movement. In fact de typical Third World cycle of really wicked government oppression, revolutionary movement, civil war, renewed suppression and prolonged economic dependency and mass poverty to some extent na de U.S.-dominated international monetary system dey cause and dey maintain am.

Since 1971, na big effort dem don put for de direction of de second step for de process of monetary expansionism. Nor be all de 160 currency wey dey freely fluctuate dey stand as problem, cos most of dem nor dey any danger of inside reasons to get value pass de dollar and so dey strengthen de respective state power along sid de U.S government own, or dem dey play only minor role for international trade so tey de calculational chaos wey dey cos of dia existence nor mean anytin. Howeva,  cos of de relative strength of dia currency and de important role dem dey play for international trade, de major West European state just as Japan na de problem  So na to all dis state wey de attempt wey U.S lead to create one world currency wey go help to rationalize economic calculation and at de same e go safeguard U.S domination and also increase im own inflationary powers don dey directed. De creation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), wen dem define before  for term of sixteen and later come be five leading export nations, wey de IMF issue, been be de move to one-world currency and one-world bank under U.S domination. [^36] Anoda important push to de direction of dis goal been come through de activity dem of de Trilateral Commission (TC), wey dem found for 1973 as anoda branch of David Rockefeller council on top Foreign Relations. Na some 300 highly influential politicians, bankers, businessmen, even intellectuals and journalist from North America, Western Europe an Japan wey compose dis one, de TC don make de establishment of world paper currency and world central bank im most important concern.^37]TC support am well well as intermediate steps towards dis ultimate goal as well as by many politicalbanker-industrialist association wey get substantial overlap of membership wit de TC and wey dey devoted to de same ends,  just like de Action Committee wey dey Europe, de Association for de Monetary Union of Europe, de Banking Federation of de European Community, de ECU Banking Association, de Basel Committee and de Wilton Park Group, dem don make great advances for aligning de European monetary front. For 1979, de European Currency Unit (ECU) wey dem newly create, and wey dem issue under de aegis of de European Economic Community, first show. Dem define am as a weighted  average of ten European currencies, and e dey assisted by organisations like de European Monetary System, de European Investment Bank, de Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, and de European Monetary Cooperation Fund, de ECU don assume plenty important rule. Since as an average e dey less volatile pass different national currencies, multinational banks and corporation in particular don find am very attractive to dey use  ECU as the unit wey dem go dey take do account and take use do settlement: economic calculation dey  less haphazard wit only three  currencies-de ECU, de yen, and de dollar—pass some dozen. In 1998, according to official intergovernmental agreements, dem establish de European Central Bank and den de ECU cum bcum de all-European currency wey supplant all national monies European[^38]

As dem don solve de European calculational chaos, and in particular as dem don neutralise de European hard currency and cum dey weakened inside  cartel wey be say by im nature e favour more  against less countries  so dat dem fit protect and prolong de hegemony of U.S over Europe, na only small go remain wey dem never do. As na only three central banks and currencies dey and de dominance wey U.S get over Europe and Japan, de most likely candidates wey dem go chose as U.S dominated World Central Bank na IMP abi BIS: and under e aegis den, wey dem initially define as basket of de dollar, de ECU, and de Yen, de "phoenix" (abi any oda name wey dem dey call am) go rise as one-world paper currency- unless, day one na, public opinion wey be de only constraint for government growth undergoes substantial change and de public cum begin to dey understand de lesson wey dem explain give for dis book: say economic rationality together wit justice and morality demand worldwide gold and standard free, 100-percentreserve banking together wit free markets worldwide; and say world government, a world central bank and a world paper currency— wey dey contrary to de deceptive impression say dem wan represent universal values—actually mean de universalization and intensification of exploitation, counterfeiting-fraud and economic destruction.[^39]
