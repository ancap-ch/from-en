### Intimidation by Argument 

[^0]: Reply to Loren Lomasky, “The Argument From Mere Argument”, *Liberty* (September 1989).

Loren Lomasky bin dey intimidated and e dey vex bcos of my book *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism*. For one, bcos de book dey more ambitious dan e title indicate. “It is”, he laments, “no less than a manifesto for untrammeled anarchism”. Make e be like dat. But so what? As my book don explain but conveniently dey unmentioned by Lomasky, untrammeled anarchism na notin but de name for a social order of untrammeled private property rights, i.e., of de absolute right of selfownership and de absolute right to homestead unowned resources, of employing dem for whateva purpose person see fit so long as e nor affect de physical integrity of oda people  likewise appropriated resources, and of entering into any contractual agreement wit oda property owners wey dey see to dey mutually beneficial. Wetin dey so horrifying about dis idea? Empirically speaking, dis property theory constitutes de hard core of most people intuitive sense of justice and so fit hardly dey called revolutionary. Na only person wey dey advocate de trammeling of private property rights go take offense, as Lomasky dey do, wit my attempt to justify a pure private-property economy.

Lomasky nor only dey enraged wit my conclusions, howeva. E anger dey further aggravated bcos I nor merely try to provide empirical evidence for dem, but rigorous proof, Lomasky dey disapprove, “validated by pure reason and uncontaminated by any merely empirical likelihoods”. E nor dey surprising say an opponent of untrammeled private property rights, such as Lomasky, go find dis undertaking doubly offensive. Yet wetin dey wrong with de idea of *a priori-theorizing* in economics and ethics? Lomasky don point out sag failed attempts to construct a priori theories dey exist. But so what? Dis only dey reflects on dose particular theories. Moreova, e actually dey presuppose de existence of a priori reasoning in dat de refutation of a priori theory gats eself be proof. For Lomasky, howeva, notin but intellectual hyperbole fit possibly dey responsible for “eschewing the low road of empiricism, soaring instead with Kant, and von Mises through the realm of a priori necessities”. A book on political philosophy or economy, den, suppose nor come up wit unambiguous conclusions as to wetin person suppose do or wetin be de rules wey e suppose follow. Everytin gats dey left vague and at a nonoperational stage of conceptual development, and nobody suppose ever try to prove anytin  but instead gats follow de foreva open-minded empiricist approach of trial and error, of tentative conjectures, of refutations, and of confirmations. Such, for Lomasky, na de proper path, de low and humble road, along which person gate to travel. E sure reach, most contemporary political philosophers seem to don wholeheartedly follow dis advice on dia way to fame. Taking de high road instead, I don present an unambiguous thesis, wey I don state in operational terms, and attempt to prove am by axiomatic-deductive arguments. If dis go make my book de ultimate insult in some philosophical circles, so much de better. Apart from oda advantages, so dis fit actually be de only appropriate method of inquiry, e at least dey forces person to say somehin specific and to open person up wide to rigorous logical-praxeological criticism instead of producing, as Lomasky and e fellow low roaders, meaningless nonoperational moonshine talk and distinctions.

Besides finding fault wit de arrogance of person to write book wey dey present a praxeologically meaningful and easily understandable thesis concerning de central problems of political philosophy and economy, and wey dey vigorously defend am to de point of excluding any oda answer as false, Lomasky also get some specific nits to pick. As go normally dey expected from an intimidated low roader, dem be either unsystematic cheap shots, or dem dey display a complete miscomprehension of de problem.

I dey criticized for not paying enof attention to Quine, Nozick, and entire bodies of philosophic thought. E fit be so, tho Nozick, if only for footnote as Lomasky don note indignantly, dey actually systematically refuted. Howeva, person go  like know why dat one go make any difference for my argument. Mere reading suggestions dey very easy to come up wit for dese times. I don deycriticized for misinterpreting Locke as I nor mention e famous proviso, but I nor det engaged to dey interprete Locke. I construct a positive theory and in so doing employ Lockean ideas; and assuming say my theory correct for dd sake of argument, doubt nor go dey as to my verdict on de proviso. E dey false, and e nor dey incompatible wit de homesteading principle as de central pillar of Locke theory. Lomasky nor demonstrate say nor be so. He dey annoyed at my dissolution of de public goods problem as a pseudo-problem witout so much as to mention my central contention regarding de matter, i.e., say dee notion of objectively distinct classes of private vs. public goods dey incompatible wit subjectivist economics and so must fall by de wayside along wit all distinctions based on am. He dey find my arguments in support of de thesis of de ever-optimality of free markets wanting because dem gats rely on de assumption of “the universal optimality of voluntary transactions”. Dey gats indeed. I neva claime anytin else. Yet dis assumption happens to dey true—in fact, as I argue, indisputably true. So wetin xup? Or Lomasky dey willing to take on de task of proving am to dey false?! How I go—in a footnote—criticize Buchanan and Tullock for Orwellian double-talk, Lomasky dey complain. Only say he dey forget to mention say I give rather specific reasons for dis characterization: among odas, de use of de notion of “conceptual” agreements and contracts in dia attempt to justify a state wen according to ordinary speech, such agreements and contracts na nonagreements and noncontracts. Noncontracting means contracting! Similarly, for my oh-so-disrespectful remarks regarding Chicago-style property theories I don give reasons (dua assumption of de measurability of utility, for instance), wey Lomasky simply dey suppresse. De rest, regarding my theory of justice, na either miscomprehension or deliberate misrepresentation. From reading Lomasky’s reconstruction of my central argument, wey revealingly employ no direct quotes, nobody go grasp e main thrust and structure: Witout scarcity  no interpersonal conflict go dey and hence no ethical questions (wetin I dey justified to do and wat not?). Conflicts na de result of incompatible claims regarding scarce resources, and dere dey but one possible way out of such predicaments: thru de formulation of rules wey dey assign mutually exclusive ownership titles regarding scarce, physical resources so as to make am possible for different actors to act simultaneously witout dereby generating conflict. (Like most contemporary philosophers, Lomasky give no indication say he don grasp de elementary yet fundamental point say any political philosophy wey nor dey construed as a theory of property rights fails entirely in e own objective and so gats dey discarded from de outset as praxeologically meaningless moonshine.)

Yet scarcity, and de possibility of conflicts, nor dey sufficient for de emergence of ethical problems. Obviously, person fit get conflicts regarding scarce resources wit an animal, yet person nor go consider am possible to resolve dese conflicts by means of proposing property norms. In such cases, de avoidance of conflicts na merely technical, nor be ethical, problem. For am to become an ethical problem, e also dey necessary say de conflicting actors dey capable, in principle, of argumentation. (Lomasky’s mosquito example as e be dey silly: Animals nor be moral agents, bcos dem dey incapable of argumentation. My theory of justice don explicitly deny e applicability to animals and, in fact, imply say dem nor get rights!)

Further, say problem of ethics nor go dey without argumentation dey indisputable. Not only say I don dey engaged for argumentation all along, but e dey impossible, witout falling into a contradiction, to deny say whether or not person get any rights and, if any which ones, gats dey decided for de course of argumentation. So, dem nor fit get ethical justification of anytin, except insofar as e dey argumentative. Dis don dey called “de a priori of argumentation”. (Insofar as Lomasky don at all understood dis, he most definitely appears to dey unaware of de axiomatic status of dis proposition, i.e., of de fact say de a priori of argumentation dey provide an absolute starting point, neither capable of, nor requiring, any further justification!)

Arguing na activity and require a person’s exclusive control over scarce resources (personal  brain, vocal cords, etc.). More specifically, as long as argumentation dey, mutual recognition of each oda exclusive control over dat kind resources dey. Na dis wey dey explain de unique feature of communication: say while person fit disagree about wetin dem don talk, e still dey possible to independently agree at least on de fact say disagreement dey. (Lomasky nor seem to dispute dis. He dey claim, howeva, say e merely dey prove de *fact* of mutually exclusive domains of control, not de *right* of self-ownership. He de wrong. Whateva [de law of contradiction, for instance] gats dey presupposed insofar as person dey argue nor fit dey meaningfully disputed bcos na de very precondition of meaningful doubt; hence, it gats dey regarded as indisputable or *a priori valid*. In de same vein, de fact of self-ownership na praxeological precondition of argumentation. Anybody wey dey try to prove or disprove anytin gats be self-owner. Na self-contradictory absurdity to ask for any further-reaching justification for dis fact. Required, of necessity, by all meaningful argumentation, self-ownership na absolutely and ultimately *justified* fact.)

Finally, if actors nor dey entitled to own physical resources oda dan dia bodies, and if dem as moral agents—categorically different from Lomasky’s mosquitoes—wan follow dis prescription, dem for don die and no problem whatsoever go dey exist. For ethical problems to exist, den, ownership for oda tins gats dey justified. Further, if persons nor dey allowed to appropriate oda resources thru homesteading action, i.e., by using dem before anybody else use am, or if de range of objects to be homesteaded dey somehow limited, dis go only dey possible if ownership fit dey acquired by mere decree instead of by action. Howeva, dis one nor qualify as solution to de problem of ethics, i.e., of conflict-avoidance, even on purely technical grounds, for e nor go allow person  decide on what to do if such declarative claims happened to dey incompatible. More decisive still, e go dey incompatible wit de already justified self-ownership, for if person fit appropriate resources by decree, dis go imply say person fit also declare anoda person body to be e own. So, anybody wey dey deny dd validity of de homesteading principle—wey e recognition dey already implicit in arguing two person mutual respect for each oda exclusive control over e own body—go contradict de content of e proposition thru e very own act of proposition making. (For one tin, for stroke of genius, Lomasky dey finds fault wit the fact say de first part of dis argument provide no justification for unlimited homesteading. True. But den e nor claim to do dat kind tin. De second part—de *argumentum a contrario*—dey do am. Regarding my argument as a whole  Lomasky claims say I don only show de validity of de nonaggression principle for de act of argument eself and not beyond... e nor extend to de object of discussion. At best, dis objection dey indicate total failure to grasp de nature of performative contradictions: If justification of anytin na argumentative justification, and if wetin gats dey  presupposed by any argumentation whatsoeva must dey considered ultimately justified, den any validity claiming proposition wey e content dey incompatible with dat kind ultimately justified facts dey ultimately falsified as involving a performative contradiction. And dat na dat.)

Philosophic and economic theorizing na real serious work.
