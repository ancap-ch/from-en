### Rationalism and Relativism for de Natural and Social Sciences


Philosophical rationalism dey claim say man dey capable to dey recognize ultimate foundation and principles of knowledge. E recognize say all knowledge wey must dey presuppose as-far-as one dey argue about any knowledge claim whatever (and so nor go fit be meaningfully disputed because na de precondition of meaningful doubt) na ultimately justified or one priori valid. De law of contradiction na one example of such knowledge. Moreover, philosophical rationalism dey assert that wey base on de recognition of such ultimate truths, man dey capable of systematic scientific progress.

Relativism dey deny de existence of absolute foundations of knowledge and de possibility of scientific progress.

E appear to be little or no evidence wey support relativism for de natural sciences. E dey undeniable say de history of de natural sciences don be one of continuous progress, and say man don achieve mastery over nature far wey surpass dat of bygone ages. Moreover, disciplines such as prepositional logic, arithmetic, Euclidean geometry, rational mechanics (classical mechanics without gravitation), and chronometry, all of which dem don term “protophysics”, provide perfect example of de rationalist idea of ultimately knowledge wey dem don find. Logic and protophysics must dey presuppose if one wan talk anything wey get meaning at all, or if one wan make empirical measurement of space, time and material and so nor go fit possibly dey invalidated by human experience or measurement. (Euclidean geometry, for instance, nor go fit talk to dey falsified by de theory of relativity because de establishment of de theory of relativity presuppose de validity of Euclidean geometry for de construction of de measurement instrument.) 

On de contrary, for full agreement with de claims of rationalism, e appear say na precisely de status of logic and protophysics as absolutely a priori don justified theories wey make progress for de empirical natural sciences systematically possible.[^1]

[^1]: For dis in particular Paul Lorenzen, *Methodisches Denken* (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1968); idem, *Normative Logic and Ethics* (Mannheim: Bibliographisches Institut, 1969),

::::> Geometry, chronometry and hylometry [rational mechanics] na a priori theories wey make empirical measurement of space, time and material ”possible”. Dem need to dey established before physics for de modern sense of all empirical science, with e hypothetical field of forces, fit begin. Therefore, igo like to call dis three disciplines by de common name: *protophysics*. De true sentence of protophysics na those sentences wey dey  defendable on de basis of logic, arithmetic and analysis, definitions and de ideal norms wey make measurements possible. (p. 60)

::::Also see Peter Janich, *Die Protophysik der Zeit* (Mannheim: Biblographisches Institut,1969); Friedrich Kambartel,*Erfahrung and Struktur* [Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1968]).

Dis view of de natural science and their development don come under criticism for de time of Thomas Kuhn’s book wey dem celebrate dat time, *The Structure of Scientific Revolution*.[^2] For detailed analysis of de central episodes for de history of de empirical natural sciences, Kuhn for there challenged de view say de process of scientific development fit dey described as e dey progress towards de truth gradually through one series of hypothetical conjectures, crucial experiments, and de elimination of theories wey dey falsified experimentally, with every future generation go know pass the previous one. Instead, according to Kuhn e don be one noncumulative, nonteleogical process. Different “paradigms” or fundamental views of de essence of nature wey dem  follow and wey supplant one another as temporary orthodoxies, with each paradigms immune from, and irrefutable by, experience, and different paradigms incommensurable with each other. Shifts of paradigms nor dey motivated by incontrovertible experience but dey akin to religious conversions. Old paradigms die out as de scientist wey don promote dem die away; new ones take their place as new generation of scientists, wey conversion fever infect,  grow up, with each generation kon dey gain new knowledge from one new creed wey dem adopt as well as kon lose old knowledge of paradigms of past generation wey dem abandon.

Kuhn’s work, that time, call for one revision of de rationalist interpretation of de natural sciences  and establish one case for relativism? While Kuhn dey inclined to think so, and while others, mostly Paul Feyerabend,  don even radicalized Kuhn’s relativistic aspirations to one “methodological anarchism” with de battle cry “anything goes”,[^3] there go fit be little doubt say neither Kuhn, Feyerabend, or anyone else don successfully persuade de general public outside of de ivory towers of academia to accept one relativistic model of de natural sciences. Now as before, de general public dey convinced of de views of rationalism, and justly so.

[^3]: See Paul Feyerabend, *Against Method* (London: New Left Books, 1975); idem, *Science in a Free Society* (London: New Left Books, 1978); idem, *Wissenschaftals Kunst* (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1984).

Dis nor be to talk say some partial truth nor dey wey dey for Kuhn’s and Fayerabend’s often investigations  wey dey fascinating. Na certainly true, and noteworthy, say losses of knowledge go fit occur even for de natural sciences, and say e dey therefore profitable to study not only de most recent publications for person field but also  de writings of authors wey don die past and forget sef. E dey also true say motives such as power, prestige, income, animosity and friendship nor dey become inoperative once people turn to de study of nature. (Who, for instance dey ready to abandon one theory wey be say im don commit e entire life work to de development only because de world around dey increasingly dey defect to another incompatible paradigm?) indeed, as one economist person fit go even further  and admit de possibility of scientific regression: One process of capital consumption, follow by lower standards of living, reduced population, disintegration of markets, and de division of labour, don dey occur repeatedly for de history of mankind go inevitably result to drop in man knowledge of nature.

Yet even when dem don talk all dis, rationalism’s claim nor dey affected for de least. For one thing, Kuhn’s and Fayerabend’s  relativism surely nor go fit dey extend to logic and protophysics. If one wan make meaningful proposition, or any measurement at all, “anything” nor dey  go. Such disciplines, wey incidentally don remain outside de scope of Kuhns’s and Feyerabend’s considerations, dey *absolutely*indispensable for *any* empirical natural science (and not irrefutable paradigms capable of substitution by other, incommensurable ones). Anyhow as e be, once dis dey recognised, and once e dey understood say proposition-making, counting,de construction of measurement instruments, and measuring, all of which make de empirical natural science dey possible, na purposeful activities, e immediately become clear say de paradigms of natural science must dey conceive of as means toward some universal, indispensable human end, and dat say dem must dey commensurable as regards their efficiency to take attain dis end.[^4]

[^4]: See on dis also Hans-Hermann Hoppe, “On Praxeology and the Praxeological Foundation of Epistemology and Ethics”, in Jeffrey Herbener, ed., *The Meaning of Ludwig von Mises* (Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1991).

De relativistic impression of de development of de empirical natural science dat Khun and Feyerabend try to carry go fit dey traced to de fact say dem both misconceive scientific theories as ordinary system of verbal propositions and systematically ignore their foundation for de reality of action. Only if one regard theory as say e dey completely detached from action nai any single theory nor  go only become immunizable, but any two rival theories wey their respective terms  nor go fit reduce to and define in terms of each other  must then appear incommensurable completely so as to exclude any rational choice between dem. Anyhow as e be, dis nor affect de refutability of any one theory, or de commensurability of one paradigm wey be rival, for de entire different level when dem take dey apply dem for de reality of actions, to dey use dem as instruments for de attainment of one practical purpose. For de level of ordinary words, paradigms fit de irrefutable and incommensurable, but in practice dem  never go fit  be. In fact, one go fit nor even state say any single paradigms dey irrefutable or any two paradigms dey incommensurable and for which respect, unless one presupposed one common categorical framework wey go fit serve as de basis for such assessment or comparison. Na dis *practical* refutability and commensurability of de paradigms of de empirical natural sciences dey explain de possibility of technological progress.

To dey systematically dey  ignore de fact say theories and theoretically interpreted observation na those of one actor, built and made so dat e go act successfully, Kuhn and Feyerabend don deprive themselves of de very criterion against which all knowledge wey concern nature dey continually tested and commensurated: de criterion to dey successfully reach one set goal by to dey apply knowledge for one given situation, or to dey fail to do so. Without de criterion of instrumental success, relativism go dey inescapable. Yet for each of our actions visa-vis nature, we confirmed claim of rationalism say one go fit identify range of applications for some theoretical knowledge and test am for e success within de range, and so, theories wey dey compete must be considered commensurable as regards such range of application and success. No situation dey conceivable wey e go dey rational to give up one intellectual tool wey dem don first prove successfully once for one range of applications if no better tool dey available. Yet, if one superior tool dey available, for example, one theory of paradigm wey allow one to reach a goal wey dem nor go fit reach equally successfully by to dey apply another, incompatible theory e go dey irrational for one actor not to adopt am. To dey sure, such irrational behavior dey empirically possible. Anyhow as e be, whoever chose am go have to pay one price for doing so. E go deprive himself de ability to achieve goals wey im for otherwise fit accomplish, and kon isolate am from all social context wey fit offer other, socio-psychological reasons not to adopt am, alone vis-à-vis nature, no one  wey dey capable to dey distinguish between successful and unsuccessful action go ever want to pay such a price. Na dis explain de unacceptability of a relativist view of de natural sciences and de possibility of de actually observable continuous – if at times for socio-psychological reasons somewhat erratic – progress for man to dey master for nature, which Kuhn and Feyerabend declare nonexistent, although all de while e belike say im dey look dem for their face.[^5]

De situation dey very different if one turn from de natural to de social sciences.  Here, de claim of rationalism be like to find less support, and relativism don gain widespread acceptance for public.

De one for front among de indicators wey dem don cite in support of relativism na de observation say nothing dey for de development of de social sciences wey resemble de progress wey dem don already achieve for de natural sciences. While our predictive powers and instrumental control over nature don dramatically increase since de time of Plato and Aristotle, de development of de empirical social sciences don dey characterized by one standstill.  In spite say all sorts of technical gadgets dey available, such as high-speed computers, e appear say we nor dey in better position today to predict social events or to dey planfully bring about social change than Plato and Aristotle for their time. (One fit note say even if de validity of dis observation dey admitted, de relativistic conclusion to which e allegedly lead nor directly follow. E only follow if e dey presupposed say de criteria for progress for social science dey identical to those wey dey natural sciences. Proponents of social relativism take dis for granted, yet, na by no means say e dey obvious why dis be so. On de contrary, for de natural sciences de object of knowledge [nature] and de subject of dis  knowledge[one actor] na different separate entities. For de social sciences, on de other hand, de object of knowledge and research be themselves knowers and researchers. In light of dis categorical difference, e go look like anything but clear why de methodology appropriate for de natural and de social sciences go fit possibly be one and de same. In fact, e dey entirely surprising say when e come to dey predict predictors, or instrumentally dey control instrumental controllers, dere *nor fit* be any systematic progress of de kind wey dem observe for de natural sciences![^7])

Moreover, proponents of relativism dey usually point out, very clearly say analogue nor dey in de social science to de role wey dem play by logic and protophsics as de a prioristic foundations of de empirical natural sciences. De rationalist claim, wey in particular dey associated with “natural law” tradition, say such analogue na economics and ethics dey provide am,[^8] don either dey forgotten and disappear from public consciousness or don dismiss out of hand: Economics, as e hold, na one empirical science wey dey very much like physics, with de objective to dey produce predictive knowledge, but unlike physics, e fail to deliver de promised goods. As regards de observation say societies wey dey prosperous and poor dey exist, wey go seem to make room for economic explanation after all – though nor be for de kind explanation wey physics don offer – de proponent of social relativism contend say such differences nor get *economic* reasons but because of different degrees of *technological* knowledge. Rich society dey rich because because of their advance state of technology; poverty na due to lack of natural-scientific know-how. Two objections to dis view dey clear: (1) de description of de fact na force. De underdeveloped societies nor dey send their future scientists and engineers in large number to de universities of advance countries, and dis poor societies nor dey then get access to de *same* knowledge upon their return as rich ones? (2) More important still, technological know-how go fit only get one material impact if e dey utilized. Anyhow as e be, in order to do dis, dere go must be savings and investments. Nor be availability of technical or scientific knowledge dey impose limit for de exploitation of actually available knowledge and for scientific progress, in-as-far as research activities, too, go must dey supported by save-up funds. So, contrary to relativistic views, economics seem to get something to do with prosperity and poverty after all![^9]

Nor, e dey claimed, ethics dey offer support for anything but relativism, for nor be de fact of continuous and, so e be, ineradicable differences of opinion for de field of contemporary politics prove de case of ethical relativism conclusively? Abi not social anthropology, de study of societies such as de Fidshi islanders, or de natives of New Guinea, for instance, kon add more evidence for support of relativistic conclusions? Institutions dey such as cannibalism or slavery which one relativist fit dey pressed hard to defend. Anyhow as e be, according to ethical relativists, regarding dis practice as counter evidence na de result of one misconception. De problem with dis institution na nor be say dem invalidate relativism but say societies wey dey adopt dem still dey under de spell of social relativism. That is, dem still forcely believe for one absolutely founded ethic. Ethical relativism, e proponent claim, rule out intolerant practices such as dis ones and implies one pluralism of values. (But e nor dey obvious say dis doctrine na entirely fallacious? Without one absolute, a priori foundation, one value pluralism na eself just another unfounded ideology, and dere is no compelling reason to adopt am over any other one. Only if one a priori valid reasons go fit dey given to dey adopt pluralism nai go fit claim to safeguard tolerance and nai dem go fit rule out cannibalism or slavery as acceptable social practices.[^10]
