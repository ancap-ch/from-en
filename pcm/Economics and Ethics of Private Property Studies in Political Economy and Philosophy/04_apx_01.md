### Demonstrated Preference and Private Property

[^0]: Reply to David Osterfeld, “tori on Hoppe”, Austrian Economics Newsletter (Spring/Summer, 1988).

Professor Osterfeld, afta e generously acknowledge de “pathbreaking” nature of my a priori defense of de ethics of private property, e cum concentrates on top four objections to my arguments.

I go comment on all de four objections wey Professor Osterfeld address. However, since dem depend on correct understanding of my central argument and e logical force, I go first restate my case for de briefest possible way.

As Osterfeld come correctly notice, I give praxeological proof for de validity of de essentially Lockean private property ethic. More precisely, I demonstrate say na only dis ethic dem fit justify argumentatively cos na im be de praxeological presupposition of argumentation, and dem fit show say any ethical proposal wey dey deviating dey violate de demonstrated preference. Dem fit raise dat kind proposal, but im propositional content go contradict de ethic wey be say  person fit use demonstrate  preference through person own act of proposition-making, as in, by de act wey dem go take use engage for argumentation. For de same way as person fit talk "I am and I go always dey indifferent for de way I dey do things" but dis proposition dey contradict de act of proposition-making, wey reveal subjective preferences (to dey talk dis instead of to talk anoda thing abi to no talk anything sef), deviationist ethical proposals dey falsified by de reality of say dem dey propose dem.

If we wan reach dis conclusion come understand im importance properly, two insights dey essential.

First, de question of wetin dey just abi wetin wey nor dey just (or wetin dey valid abi wetin nor dey valid) only arise as far as say me and odas dey capable say we wan do propositional exchanges -of argumentation. De question nor fit arise for stone abi fish bcus dem  dey incapable of producing validity-claiming propositions. Yet if na lik so dis one dey- and person nor fit deny say na lik so witout say person go dey contradict imsef, say person nor fit argue de case wey im not fit argue- den any ethical proposal, or any proposition, must be assume say im don claim am fit dey validated by propositional abi argumentative means. If dem wan produce any proposition, overtly abi as an internal thought, person go demonstrate im preference for de willingness say e wannan rely on top argumentative means make e use convince imsef abi odas of something. E no get how dem fit justify anything unless na justification by means of propositional exchanges and arguments e be. Na must say dem go consider am as de ultimate defeat for ethical proposal if person fit demonstrate say im content dey logically incompatible wit de claim of de proponents say im validity de ascertainable by argumentative means. If dem wan demonstrate dat kin incompatibility, e go amount to proof wey dey impossible, and dat kin proof dey deadly for de realm of intellectual inquiry.

Second, de means wey person dey use demonstrate preference through say e dey engage for argumentation na dos of private property. Obviously, nor one fit propose anything or become convinced of any proposition through argumentative means if person dey right to exclusive use of im physical body nor dey presupposed. Furthermore, e go dey equally impossible to sustain argumentation and rely on de propositional force of person argument if dem nor allow person make e appropriate oda scarce goods through homesteading actions, through say make im put am to good use before anoda person go do am, abi if dat kin goods and de right to exclusive control regarding dem nor dey defined for objective evaluative terms, nor body fit survive as physically independent decision-making unit; so, nor body fit raise any validity-claiming proposition.

Thus, as person dey alive dey formulate proposition, person dey demonstrate say any ethic except for one of private property dey invalid.

Osterfeld’s fourth objection states say my argument na instance of ethical naturalism, but say I come fall afoul of de naturalistic wey I take derive an "ought" from an "is". De first part of dis proposition dey acceptable, but de second part nor dey acceptable. Wetin I offer na entirely value-free system of ethics. I remain exclusively for de realm of is statement and I no dey try to drive an "ought" from an "is". De structure of my argument na lik dis: (a) justification dey propositional abi argumentative (a priori true is-statement);(b) argumentation presupposes de recognition of de private property ethic (a priori true is-statement); (c) nor deviation from a private property ethic go dey justified argumentatively (a priori true is-statement). Thus, my refutation of all socialist ethics na purely cognitive one. Say Rawls abi oda socialists fit still advocate dat kin ethics dey completely beside point. Say one plus one equals two nor rule out de possibility say someone talk say na three, or say person nor try to make one plus one equal to three de arithmetic law of de land. However, dis one nor affect de fact say one plus one na still two. For strict analogy to dis, I "only" claim to prove say anything  Rawls abi oda socialists talk na lie and  e fit dey understood  lik dat by  all intellectually competent and honest men. E nor change de face say incompetence abi dishonesty and evil  fit still exist and fit even prevail over truth and justice.

De second objection dey suffer from de same misunderstanding of de value-free nature of my defense of private property. Osterfeld agree say argumentation presupposes de recognition of private property. But den he wonders about de source of dis right. Yet how he go raise dat kin question? Only because he, too, dey capable of argumentation. Without argumentation nothing go dey except silence or meaningless noise. De answer be say de source of human rights is  and must be argumentation as de manifestation of our rationality. E dey impossible make we claim  anything else make e be de starting point wey dem go  use for de derivation of ethical system cos if dem claim so,  e go once again presuppose person argumentative capability. Shey dem not fit derive right from a contract behind a “veil of ignorance” Osterfeld ask? Yes and no. Of course, rights dey wey dem fit derive from contract, but if dem want make contract dey possible, private owners and private property must dey; otherwise physically independent contractors nor go dey and dem nor go agree on anything contractually. And "nor": dem nor fit derive rights "from behind a veil of ignorance" cos nobody dey live behind dat kin tin except epistemological zombies, and na only Rawlsian zombie ethic dem fit derive behind am. Shey rights fit emerge from tradition a la Hume or Burke? Of course, dem go always emerge. But de question of d factual emergence of rights nor get anything to do wit de question of say dem fit justify wetin exist abi dem nor fit justify am.

In his third objection, Osterfeld claims that I construct an alternative between either individual ownership or world community ownership but that such an alternative is not exhaustive. This is a misrepresentation. Nowhere do I say anything like this. In the section to which Osterfeld refers, I am concerned with explaining the entirely different alternative between property as defined in physical terms and as originating at definite points in time for definite individuals in contrast to property as defined in value terms and nonspecific with respect to its time of origin, and the refutation of the latter as absurd and self-contradictory. I do not at all rule out the possibility of ownership of “intermediate communities”. However, such ownership presupposes individual private ownership. Collective ownership requires contracts, and contracts are only possible if there are already prior noncontractually acquired ownership claims. Contracts are agreements between physically independent units which are based on the mutual recognition of each contractor’s private ownership claim to things acquired prior to the agreement and which concern the transfer of these property titles from a specific prior to a specific later owner or owners.

Regarding Osterfeld’s first objection, I did not write that the fundamental goals of political economy and political philosophy are “complementary” ones. What I said is that they are different. No one trying to answer ‘What is just”? is logically committed to insisting that his answer must also contribute to the greatest possible production of wealth (at least I don’t contend anywhere that there is any such logical commitment!). Hence, it is no valid objection to my remarks on the relationship between political philosophy and economy that Hobbes, Rousseau, and others suggest that political systems do not increase wealth but rather scarcity. Their claim that such systems are just cannot be made good, and as it turns out, the ethic which alone can be justified indeed helps maximize wealth production. Fortunately, this is a matter of fact. It does not change in the least the fact that political philosophy and political economy are concerned with completely separate issues.

This and only this has been my thesis: While political philosophers as such need not be concerned with the problem of alleviation of scarcity, political philosophy and economy have in common the fact that without scarcity neither discipline would make any sense. There would be no interpersonal conflict over anything, and no question as to what norms should be accepted as just in order to avoid such possible clashes! It is no stretching of the point to say that political philosophers have invariably been concerned with the assignment of rights of exclusive control over scarce goods. Such is the case when a Lockean proposes to accept the private property ethic, and no less when a Hobbesian suggests, instead, to make some person the supreme Führer, whose commands everyone else must follow.
