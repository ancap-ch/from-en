### Demonstrated Preference and Private Property

[^0]: Reply to David Osterfeld, “Comment on Hoppe”, *Austrian Economics Newsletter* (Spring/Summer, 1988).

Professor Osterfeld, after e don generously acknowledge de “pathbreaking” nature of my a priori defense of de ethics of private property, e come concentrate on four objections to my arguments.

I go comment on all de four objections wey Professor Osterfeld dey address. Howeva, since dem depend on de correct understanding of my central argument and e logical force, I go first restate my case in de briefest possible way.

As Osterfeld don correctly notice, I give one praxeological proof for de validity of de private property ethic wey dey essentially Lockean. More precisely, I demonstrate say na only this ethic fit be argumentatively justified becos na em be de praxeological presupposition of argumentation, and any ethical proposal wey dey deviating fit be shown hence as violation for demonstrated preference. Dem fit raise dat kin proposal, but e propositional content go contradict de ethic wey person go take demonstrate preference by virtue of person own act of proposition-making, i.e., by de act of to dey engage in argumentation. In de same way wey person fit talk say “I be and always go dey indifferent toward doing tings” tho dis proposition contradict de act of proposition-making, wich reveal subjective preferences (to dey talk say dis rather dan to dey say something else or nor to dey talk anything at all), deviationist ethical proposals dey falsified by de reality of to dey actually propose dem.

To dey reach dis conclusion and properly understand e importance, two insights dey essential.

First, de question of wetin dey just or unjust (or wetin dey valid or nor dey valid) only dey arise insofar as I dey and oders wey capable of propositional exchange—for argumentation. De question nor arise for one stone or fish becos dem dey incapable to dey produce validity-claiming propositions. Yet if dis dey so—and person nor fit deny say na without contradicting eself, for person nor fit argue de case say e nor fit argue—den any ethical proposal, or indeed any proposition, gat dey assumed to claim say  e fit be validated by propositional or argumentative means. To dey produce any proposition, overtly or as per internal thought, peson suppose demonstrates e preference for de willingness to rely on argumentative means to convince eself or others of something. No way dey den to justify anything unless e be justification by means of propositional exchanges and arguments. E gat dey considered de ultimate defeat for one ethical proposal if person fit demonstrate say e content dey logically incompatible wit de claim of proponents say e validity dey ascertainable by argumentative means. To demonstrate such incompatibility go amount to impossibility proof, and such proof dey deadly in de realm of intellectual inquiry.

Second, de means wey one peson demonstrate preference na to dey engage for argumentation na dos of private property. Obviously, no  peson fit propose anything or convince for any proposition by argumentative means if one peson rights to exclusive use of e physical body nor dey presupposed. Furthermore, e go dey equally impossible to sustain argumentation and rely on de propositional force of e arguments if de peson nor dey allowed to appropriate oder scarce goods thru homesteading action, to dey put dem to use befor somebody else do am, or if such good and de right for exclusive control regarding dem nor dey defined for objective physical terms. If such a right nor dey presupposed, or if latecomers gat legitimate claims to tings, or tings owned dey defined for subjective evaluative terms, no person go fit to survive as one physically independent decision-making unit; hence, no peson go ever raise any validity-claiming proposition.

Thus, to dey dey alive and to dey formulate propositions, peson dey demonstrate say any ethic except dat of private property dey invalid.

Osterfeld fourth objection state dat my argument na one instance of ethical naturalism, but say I come fall afoul of de naturalistic fallacy of to dey derive one “ought” from one “is”. De first part of dis proposition dey acceptable, but de second nor dey acceptable. Wetin I offer na one entirely value-free system of ethics. I remain exclusively in de realm of “is” statements and norwhere try drive one “ought” from an “is”. De structure of my argument na dis: (a) justification dey propositional or argumentative (a priori true is-statement); (b) argumentation dey presuppose de recognition of de private property ethic (a priori true is-statement); (c) no deviation from one private property ethic fit dey justified argumentatively (a priori true is-statement). Thus, my refutation of every socialist ethic na one purely cognitive ting. Say Rawls or oder socialist fit still advocate dat kin ethics dey completely beside de point. Say one plus one equal two nor rule out de possibility say peson talk say na three, or talk say person nor suppose attempt to make one plus one equal three de arithmetic law of de land. Howeva, dis one nor affect de fact say one plus one still be two. In strict analogy to dis, me “only” dey claim to prove say wateva Rawls or oder socialists say na false and only fit dey understood like dat by all intellectually competent and honest mandem. E nor change de fact say incompetence or dishonesty and evil still fit exist and fit even prevail over truth and justice.

De second objection dey suffer from de same misunderstanding of de value-free nature of my defense of private property. Osterfeld agree say argumentation dey presuppose de recognition of private property. But e dey wonder about de source of dis right. Yet how e go fit raise such question? Only becos e, too, dey capable of argumentation. Without argumentation nothing go dey except silence or meaningless noise. De answer na de source of human right dey, and e gat be argumentation as de manifestation of our rationality. E dey impossible to claim anything else to dey be de starting point for de derivation of one  ethical system becos claim something like dat go once again gat be to presuppose person argumentative capability. Shey rights nor fit be derived from one contract behind one “veil of ignorance” Osterfeld dey ask? Yes and no. Of course, rights fit dey derived from contracts, but in order for one contract to dey possible, private owners and private property suppose don dey ground; otherwise physically independent contractors nor go dey and nothing to contractually agree on top. And “no”: no rights fit dey derived “from behind one veil of ignorance” becos no peson dey live behind such ting except epistemological zombies, and only one Rawlsian zombie ethic fit be derived from behind am. Shey rights fit emerge from tradition a la Hume or Burke? Of course, dem always dey emerge. But de question of de factual emergence of right nor get anything to do wit de question of whether or not wetin exist fit dey justified.

For e third objection, Osterfeld claim say I construct one alternative between either individual ownership or world community ownership but say such alternative nor dey exhaustive. Dis na misrepresentation. I nor talk for anything like this anywhere. In de section wey Osterfeld dey refer to, I dey concerned wit explaining de entire different alternative wey dey between property as e dey defined for physical terms and as e dey originating for definite points in time for different individual body in contrast to property wey dey defined for value terms and nonspecific wit respect to e time of origin, and de refutation of de latter as absurd and self-contradictory. I nor rule out de possibility of ownership of “intermediate communities” at all. Howeva, dat kin ownership dey presuppose individual private ownership. Collective ownership dey require contract, and contracts only dey dey possible if already prior non-contractually acquired ownership claims dey available. Contracts na agreement between physically independent units wey dey base on de mutual recognition of each private ownership contractor claim to de tings wey don dey acquired prior to de agreement and wich concern de transfer of dis property titles from one specific prior owner to anoder specific later owner or owners.

Regarding de first objection wey Osterfeld raise, I nor write say de fundamental goal of political economy and political philosophy dey “complementary” to each oder. Wetin I talk na say dem dey different. No person wey dey try to answer ‘Wetin dey just”? dey logically committed to insisting say e answer gat also contribute to de greatest possible production of wealth (at least I no dey contend anywhere say any logical commitment like dat dey!). Hence, e nor be valid objection to my remarks on de relationship between political philosophy and economy wey Hobbes, Rousseau, and oders suggest say political systems nor dey increase wealth but instead e dey increase scarcity. Dem claim say such system dey just nor fit dey proper, and as e turn out, de ethic wich alone fit be justified indeed dey help maximize wealth production. Fortunately, dis na matter of fact. E nor change in de least, de fact say political philosophy and political economy dey concerned with completely separate issues.

Dis and only dis don be my thesis: While political philosopher as such need nor been dey concerned with de problem of alleviation of scarcity, political philosophy and economy get in common de fact say without scarcity none of de two discipline go make any sense. Interpersonal conflict over anything no go dey, and no question as per wetin be de norms wey suppose dey accepted as just in order to avoid possible clashes like dat! E no need to dey stretch de point to say say political philosophers don invariably dey concerned wit de assignment of rights of exclusive control over goods scarce. Such na de case wen one Lockean dey propose to accept de private property ethic, and no less wen one Hobbesian suggest instead say, to make mandem de supreme Führer, wey everyone else gat follow e command.
