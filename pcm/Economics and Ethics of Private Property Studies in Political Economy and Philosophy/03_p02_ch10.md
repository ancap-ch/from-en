##  Research wey base on top causal scientific principle fit dey possible for inside social science?

###

De use of mathematical and statistical  don dey spread inside social science . E don dey show some importance, derefore, to demonstrate with full description of all dis technique dem say reason dey to doubt dia applicability for de field of  social sciences.

De aim of dis paper na to offer de kind demonstration wey get specific reference to de techniques wey go allow us to take one set of data come decide de value of de constant dem, by de means wey one variable, wey dem interprete as dependent variable, fit carry body join law-governed relationship  with oda variable dem. E nor dey relevant weda dis relationship dey linear or nonlinear, weda na one or more  independent variable dem wey dey, weda—as e be for time-series analyses— de dependent variable dem dey also function (time-shifted) as independent variable dem, and weda de relationship dey recursive or nonrecursive, deterministic or statiscal. De  critique dey apply to all technique, from simple linear regression to de comparatively complex procedure of time-series analysis, as far as dat kind technique na im dem dey use to decide de value of constants (including dose wey get value wey vary according to same consistent pattern). E nor too need pointing out say de use of dat kind technique don dey increase. For de field of economics,  econometrics dey steadily establish im position as de house of all dis technique,[^1] even top de criticism from people wey support pure economics.[^2] For sociology, too, de systematic introduction of econometric technique dem don dey show as universal panacea, as dem Forster one trend pass odas cos of de works of Blalock.[^3]

To illustrate all dis argument, make we assume say de value of de constants ::b_1:: and ::b_2:: in the multiple regression equation

::Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + e:: 

don dey determined on top de basis of one particular set of data. ::Y::—we dey interprete de dependent variable— as  linear function of de independent variables ::X_1:: and ::X_2:: and a magnitude of error e with a mean value of ::0::.

Na in two ways we go fit interprete de :b:-constants for dis equation. either na innocuous, but unusual interpretation or dia normal interpretation. Dis second interpretation sha, no dey innocuous. E carry assumption join body, wey as we go show, nor dey appropriate inside social science dem

Just as de first innocuous interpretation, de partial regression coefficients dey represent notin pass de variable statement of how to predict de ::Y:: values  well on de basis of de ::X_1:: and ::X_2:: values (assuming sey both linearity and dat one dey deal with additive effect dem). De constants na historico-mathematical facts. Dem no get any significance wey pass de historical data as e concern which value dem determine.

Objection nor fit dey for dis interpretation. de consequences dey sha, say to set up equation like de one wey dey up, dey downgrade im relevance. Nor be theoretical principle wey person go dey establish, instead im go just dey describe de fact dem and wetin be one of a kind description for imfit generate  at will for any group of data, by just to change im assumption about de type of function and by to use computer.

E nor dey probable say anybody don eva do regression analysis cos im wan achieve only wetin dis innocuous interpretation dey mean. Dem dey interpret am as to formulate general hypothesis, to set up de  equation wey dey up, wey we fit talk sey na false if we use new data and data wey dey claim say de relationship between  ::Y::, ::X_1:: and ::X_2::, wey de constant determine for de equation dey universally valid.

###

We fit reconstruct de implicit assumptions wey dis interpretation dey demand if we consider de following situation. wen we use fresh data we don make attempt to reproduce de result wey we get and wey we formalize through analysis of de initial set of data for de above equation, wen we use constants with determined value dem. Make we assume say de outcome of dus attempt na say de  multiple linear regression analysis wey we do for both de ::Y:: and the ::X_1:: and ::X_2:: variables of dis second group of data produces :b: constants wey diverge wella from dose wey we obtain for de first group of data.
As e be for de innocuous interpretation of dat kind equation, dis result nor go get any particular consequences. With de first set of data, person don establish one type of historico-mathematical fact and with de second one, na anoda fact. De two dey difderent, and na all about am be dat. Just as de normal interpretation, howeva de failure to reproe de result go make de hypothesis to be false.

De prerequisite to dey able to say na “falsify” be de “constancy principle”, de conviction say observable phenomena dey for principle wey cause determine,  wey sey constant  and wey also dey time-invariant for de way wey dem dey operate, and say for principle contingency nor get any part to play for de way wey cause dey operate. Na only we dem assume say de constancy principle dey valid wey im dey from any failure to make anoda result say anytin dey wrong with de original hypothesis.

E clear say de constancy principle nor  base on top experience. As we don know since Hume, e no get link wey we don see wey connect event dem, and even if dat kind link dey, experience nor dit show weda e been dey time-invariant or  not.Dem no fit disapprove de principle by experience, cos if dem don accept am, any oda event wey wan disprove am (like failure to duplicate result) fit dey interpreted from  de beginning as if experience dey show say one variable nor be de cos of anoda variable if dem dey explain (if nor be so, de result go dey duplicated successfully).  We nor fit draw any conclusion weda dem fit find anoda variable wey turn out to be time-invariant with de way wey e dey operate with respect to de dependent variable wey we dey interested in. To de extent wey experience nor fit exclude dis possibility, we nor fit disprove de validity of de constancy principle.

Although e nor dey derived from experience and e nor dey disprovable by experience, de constancy principle na very  necessary condition for experience  wey dem fit regard if dem dey  confirm abi falsifying demsef (wey dey in contrast to de isolated and unconnected  experiences wey dey connected with historical facts).[^4]  Dem fit interpret de failure to duplicate results could be interpreted as falsifying de original hypothesis wey dey in accordance with de normal interpretation of de regression equation, and person fit dey prompted make e explain de differing values for de :b: constants by asserting say for one sample one abi more factors ::F:: dey implicitly involved in causing ::Y:: wey nor dey present for de oda sample abi wey nor operate for de same way. Finally, person fit feel de need make e explain dese factors ::F:: hypothetically and make e put dem inside dey initial hypothesis wey only assume only de systematic operation of ::X_1:: and ::X_2::, so e go replace one hypothesis with new one. But all dis only dey possible to de extent say person don already assume de validity of de constancy principle for ::Y:: with all de factors wey dey ::Y::.

We don assert say sphere of objective reality dey wey  we nor fit regard  as determined laws, and say, derefor, nor equation dey describe em behaviour (just lik de regression equation wey dem give for u) wey dem fit formulate and wey dem fit give normal interpretation.

Since we nor fit doubt de validity of de constancy principle for de evidence of external, sensory experience, e dey on only logical ground say dem go correctly regard de principle as inapplicable for any particular sphere.

De constancy principle na operational  schema, na method. Person nor fit experience cum learn say causes dey wey dey always operate  for de same way, instead person go establish say dat phenomena get particular cause by following a particular type of investigative procedure, thru refusing principle wey go allow any exceptions (instances of inconstancy), and e go dey prepared say e go deal with dem by producing new hypothesis anytime wey dem need one. De world by itself nor dey sufficient to take establish de constancy principle. E require de existence of perceiving subject wey dey active. For em part, dis active subject - de prerequisite for a world wey causes wey get constant effect determine - nor fit, cos of logical reasons, assume de validity wey dey de constancy principle with respect to de states of em knowledge (and for em intentional actions wey fit draw on dat knowledge). In order say dem wan guarantee de unconditional validity of de constancy principle, de subject must fit learn by emsef. E must start from de assumption say e fit assimilate experiences wey dey falsified and e must fit replace old hypothesis with new ones dem. If on de oda hand person fit view em state of knowledge as e take cause am and if person go treat anytin wey dem neva know as being predictable for principle, person go deprive emsef of all possibilities wey em go fit use em ability take learn, as in, wey he go use form new, previously hypothesis wey dem neva know before, as de way wey dem fit use maintain de law-governed nature of dat sphere of reality, wey nor dey constituted by knowledge abi actions drawing for dat knowledge.

De result of dis logical analysis of de constancy principle as de principle of a nonempirically based operational schema wey under causal investigation  be say de principle only dey valid for dat objective sphere wey nor dey constituted with person knowledge abi actions wey dey manifest dat knowledge. (In dis sphere, de question of weda law-governed constants dey on de basis say e go dey possible  make dem make ex ante prediction  dey positively determined independently  of experience, and empirical factors fit only play role for de question  of which concrete variable  dey causally linked to which  concrete variable  and which one nor dey linked.) For de sphere of knowledge and action, for anoda hand, e nor fit dey valid. (for dis sphere, de question of weda or not constant dey even dey empirical for nature and dem only fit decide am for a given variable based on experience wey don pass, wey dey decided ex post.)

For anyone wey dey capable to learn, deir knowledge nor fit dey logically regarded as determined by complex causes wey dey operate for constant way (whether statistically abi deterministically). Dere fit be only constants wey dey in relation to de causes of event where person dey deal with a world of nonlearning objects, abi more correctly, where person conceive an objective sphere of reality as a world of nonlearning objects. Person nor fit to dey think of emsef as nonlearning. Nor be only as intellect wey dey function according with de constancy principle fit be learning intellect (we dey learn about how objects wey dem conceive as non-learning dey behave), but de statement “I fit learn” also prove to hold through for oda respects. Na fact say dem nor fit falsify am, cos if dem wan falsify am, person go need to learn. And from anoda side, person nor fit argue justifiably against de statement since, qua argument, possible replies must dey for am, and as de validity of argument (wey dem oppose to dat of a stimulus) go dey independent of de nature wey dem use reply, dem must regard dat kind possible reply as contingent reactions, and derefor, e must dey possible to learn am.

No scientific advance go fit eva alter de fact say person regard im knowledge and action as uncaused. Person fit hold dis idea of “freedom” as werin nor dey real, and from de point of view of “scientist dem” wey get cognitive power and superior to any human, as in, from de poin of view God, dat kind description fit dey correct. Howeva, we nor be God, even if freedom nor be real thing for im eye, for we wey be human being wetin necessary even doh e nor real.[^5] we nor go fit predict how our knowledge go dey later for future and de action dem wey dey show dat knowledge for de basis of previous state dem, we fit on reconstruct dem afta de event.[^6]

[^5]: Na de same illusion wey go come up in relation to God, if person assume say im to go fit learn.

[^6]: Karl R. Popper, Das Elend des Historizismus (Tübingen: Mohr, 1971), p. xii, states in this connection that it is

::::> e nor dey possible for any scientific forecaster—weda na human being or computer—to predict  im own future results, e nor mata  which method wey dem use. Any attempt to do am go  only achieve im goal post festum.

::::On top de methodological significance wey dis statement get,  follow see  K.O. Apel, Die Erklären: Verstehen Kontroverse in transzendental-pragmatischer Sicht (Frankfurt/ M.: Suhrkamp, 1979), note 19, pp. 44ff.

Make we return to de regression equation wey we see for de beginning of de discussion:

::Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + e::

bring de argument full circle. make de dependent variable ::Y:: fo dis equation be any intentional action (any action wey try any how to achieve goal wey dem like pass starting point and oda alternative dem and wey dey manifest knowledge for many ways).

wen we set up dis equation or wen we determine de value dem of de constants for one particular set of data, if we choose to accept de normal interpretation, we dey make de following assertion:

complex of cause wey nor dey change how e dey operate dey wey dey cause  ::Y::, and e dey possible for de basis of de knowledge wey we get about dis complex and about de way wey e dey operate (im fucntion type) to predict sat intentional act go happen or e nor go happen ::Y:: (conceived of as a dichotomic 0/1 variable). On top de basis of experience wey dey in connection with one particular set of data, na provisional hypothesis just like the equation for up wey dem dey use describe de causal relationship wey dey explain ::Y::  (as dem determine de value of de constant with respect to magnitude). New experience dem fit mean say dis strong assumption on top de causal variable and function type must to follow revision. Oda incorporating different assumptions dem fit replace de equation. Some examples fit be:

1. ::Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + b_3 X_3 + e::
2. ::Y = a + b_1 Z + b_1 X_1 + e::
3. ::Y = a + b_1 \log X_1 + b_2 X_2 + e::
4. ::Y = a + b_1 X_1 + b_2 X_2 + b_3 X_1 X_2 + e::


In equation ::(1):: we assumed say ::X_3:: na causal variable just like ::X_2::. Equation ::(2):: assumes say variable ::Z:: (correlated with ::X_1::) na de cause of ::Y:: nor be ::X_1:: as den assume for de beginning. Equation ::(3):: no dey assume  linear relation again in respect to de effect of ::X_1::. Last last, equation ::(4)::  det assume interactive as well as additive effect as e regard de two variables ::X_1:: and ::X_2::. No mata which equation dem substitute for de original one, howeva, or weda  original one dey always appear to look valid, na still de case say ::Y:: dey predictable, howeva e big reach person fit argue about de short detail of de equation.

De tori wey we been talk before show say ds assertion nor dey tenable. ::Y::, we nor fit predict qua intentional act for principle.Dis conclusion dey follow de argument wey we fit summarize here:

1. Me and—as possible opponents wey join for argument—oda people go fit learn.[^7] (we nor go fit challenge dis statement, if we nor implicitly admit sey dis one dey correct. Above every every, anybody wey dey undertake research into causes go don assume am. To dis extent, proposition ::(1):: na valid priori).
2. If e dey possible to learn,  person nor go fit know for one time wetin im go know later and how im go behave for basis of dis knowledge. (If person know wetin im go later know for one time, e nor go dey possible to eva learn anytin— but see proposition ::(1):: for dis point.)
3. De assertion say e dey possible to predict de future state of person own and/or anoda person knowledge and de corresponding action wey dey manifest de knowledge (as in to find de variable wey dem fit interpret as de causes) dey involve contradiction. if de subject of one state of knowledge or of one intentional act go fit learn, den cause dey for dis one; howeva, if causes dey, den de subject nor go fit learn—but again see proposition ::(1)::.

[^7]: De transition from one man to de oda man dey claim sey indefensible of solipsism na true. we nor fit argue  say e dey possible for two people to argue say solipsism nor fit dey defended,  since to want to argue for im defense person don already throw am overboard. See on top dis argument Karl R. Popper, Conjectures and Refutations (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969), pp. 293ff.; idem, Objective Knowledge (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1972), pp. 119ff., 235ff. See also K.O. Apel, Transformation der Philosophie (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1973), vol. 2, part II, and Jürgen Habermas, Legitimationsprobleme in Spätkapitalismus (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1973), note 160, p. 1521.

Na de causes dem wey  ::Y::  get wey dey qua intentional act and de putative constants through de means wey ::Y::  say all dis causes dey enta relationship with dem sef na true sey notin wey significant pass variables wey we don see as contigent, covariant relationships with ::Y:: for particular point in time. na purely contingent historico-mathematical fact (but e nor be confirmation for hypothesis!) If dem been produce  all dis covariant relationship dem exactly or even just de same level with new data. Na only for principle confidence wey people wey dey de same situation as de same set of variable dey act for de same way ( bring de same knowledge to bear). If person fit learn e dey clear sey e nor dey possible to predict weda de person go learn or not from one point in time to de next one. Na only with post festum wey we fit ascertain am, as fact we don dey already. Ultimately, for dis kind of covariant relationship all change must show as contingent fact ( and nor be like falsification of one hypothesis!). If person fit learn, den e nor only dey impossible to predict weda im go learn for any situation., but e dey equally impossible to predict wetin, person go learn.
