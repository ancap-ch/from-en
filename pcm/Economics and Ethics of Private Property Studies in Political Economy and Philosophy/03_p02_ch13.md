## For de Ultimate Justification of de Ethics of Private Property

Ludwid von Mises for  im masterpiece Human Action wey im write don show de entire body of economic theory as e be, and as we fit deduce from our own understanding wetin action mean(plus small general assumptions wey talk about de reality where action for dey take place). im call dis conceptual knowledge de "axiom of action", and im demonstrate de sense wey action carry bring economic theory, dat one mean say values, ends, means and choice, preference, profit, loss and cost gats dey considered. e nor dey derived from sense impressions but from reflection (person nor fit see actions but rada person fit interpret some kind physical things as actions!). For sure, e nor fit dey possible to say na wrong thing by any experience, anyhow wey e be, cos any attempt to do so go just be like say we dey assume say action dey and  person wey dey act, him understanding of de types of action (to experience sometin, na intentional action).

So as we don  reconstruct economics as, in de last resort, wey dem get from  one true proposition before, Mises fit claim say im don provide ultimate foundation of economics. im call im so-founded economics “praxeology,” wey mean the logic of action, in order to emphasize de fact sey im propositions fit dey proven by virtue of de action-axiom wey we nor fit argue about and de laws of logical reasoning wey we nor fit argue about too(wey include de laws of identity and contradiction)—wey dey completely independent, wic mean say, e fit stand any kind of test (as e dey used, for example, for physics). Well, even if im idea of praxeology and im thinking of construction of de entire body of praxeological don place am among de great people of de modern Western tradition of rationalism for de search for some foundations like dat, Mises nor think say anoda claim of dis tradition fit dey gud: de claim say oda foundations for inside ethical mata dem dey gud. According to Mises  e nor get ultimate justification wey don dey for ethical propositions de same way wey e dey for economic propositions. Economics fit tell us weda or not certain means  dey correct to bring some kind ends, yet weda or not de ends fit dey regarded as just nor fit dey decided by economics or by any oda science. justification nor dey  for choosing one instead of to choose anoda end. last last, which end dey chosen dey different from a scientific point of view and na mata of subjective whim, wey nor dey capable of any justification pass de small fact of say people like you.

Many libertarians don follow Mises ontop dis mata . just like Mises, dem don abandon de idea of rational foundation of ethics. As im dey do, dem don make enough from de economic proposition of say de libertarian private property ethic dey produce higher general standard to live pass anoda one; say most people dey like higher pass lower standards of living; and so, libertarianism suppose dey popular. But for real, as Mises been know very well , such considerations go only fit convince person wey dey into  libertarianism who don already accept de “utilitarian” plan of general wealth maximization. For dose wey nor gree for dis goal, dem nor get wetin dey drive dem at all. So, finally, libertarianism dey based on notin but arbitrary act of faith.

For dis mata I don outline  argument wey demonstrate why dis position nor fit work well , and how de important Lockean private property ethic of libertarianism fit dey justified. To start, dis argument support de natural rights position of libertarianism as espoused by de master thinker of de modern libertarian movement, Murray N. Rothbard- ontop every for im Ethics of Liberty. Still on still, de argument wey bring de ultimate justification of private property dey different from de one wey de natural rights tradition offer. instead of dis tradition, na Mises, and im idea of praxeology and praxeological proofs, wey fit provide de model.

I follow show say only de libertarian private property ethic fit dey justified argumentatively, cos na im b d  praxeological presupposition of argumentation as such; and say dem fit show any deviating, nonlibertarian ethical proposal make e look like say e dey violate de preference wey we don show. we fit make dat kind proposal, ofcos, but im propositional content go contradict de ethic of which person show im preference by virtue of proposition-making, as in, by de act of engaging in argumentation as such. For example, person fit talk say “people no go always dey interested* wen e come to make dem do sometin,” but dis proposition go cast cos of de very act of proposition making, wey go fit demonstrate subjective preference (ro say dis instead wey we for talk something else or nor even talk anytin at all). Same same, non-libertarian ethical proposals dey show na lie by wetin we already know if im dey propose dose ones.

To reach dis conclusion and to understand how dis one dey important and im logical force, two insights dey very important.

First, make we note say de question of wetin dey just or unjust—or for matter de big general question of wetin dey valid proposition and wetin nor dey inside—fit only arise so far as me and oda people dey  capable of propositional exchanges, as in, to fit argue. De question nor arise through stone or fish cos dem nor fit  engage in dat kind exchanges and to produce propositions wey dey claim validity. But if dis na so—and person nor fit deny say e fit happen without for am to contradict imsef, as person nor fit argue case wey person nor fit argue —den any ethical proposal as well as any oda proposition dey assume say e dey capable of validity by propositional or argumentative means. (Mises, too,  as far as im dey formulate economic propositions, go dey assume sey im claim am.) In fact, to produce any proposition, overtly or as internal thought, person don demonstrate im preference say im dey willing to rely on argument  to convince himself or others of sometin. So, no way fit dey enough to justify anything unless say na justification by means of propositional exchanges and arguments. Anyhow e be, den e must dey considered as de ultimate defeat for ethical proposal if person fit  demonstrate say im content dey logically incompatible with de claim of de person wey dey propose say d legitness go dey correct by argument. To demonstrate dat kind incompatibility go amount to  impossibility proof, and dat kind proof go constitute de most deadly defeat possible in the realm of intellectual inquiry.

Second, we gats note say argumentation nor consist of free-floating propositions but na form of action wey require de use of means wey nor dey easy to reach; and say de means wey person dey carry demonstrate say im like by engaging in propositional exchanges na de means dem of private property. For one thing, nobody fit just propose anything, and no person fit dey convinced of any proposition cos of argumentative means, if we nor already think say de  person get right to make exclusive use of im physical body. na dis recognition of we exclusive mutual  control on top we own body wey explain de distinctive character of propositional exchanges, wey say while man fit disagree about wetin im don talk, e still dey possible to agree at least ontop de fact wey be say disagreement dey. E dey  obvious say property right for we own body gats dey said to be justified a priori, for anybody wey don try  to justify any kind norm go suppose don know de exclusive right of control over him body as valid norm simply in order to say, “I propose dis one and dis one” Any person wey nor support dat kind right go hang for practical contradiction since to argue go already mean say de person don accept the norm wey him nor accept.

Furthermore, it would be equally impossible to sustain argumentation for any length of time and rely on the propositional force of one’s arguments if one were not allowed to appropriate in addition to one’s body other scarce means through homesteading action (by putting them to use before somebody else does), and if such means and the rights of exclusive control regarding them were not defined in objective physical terms. For if no one had the right to control anything at all except his own body, then we would all cease to exist and the problem of justifying norms simply would not exist. Thus, by virtue of the fact of being alive, property rights to other things must be presupposed to be valid. No one who is alive could argue otherwise.

Moreover, if a person did not acquire the right of exclusive control over such goods by homesteading action, i.e., by establishing an objective link between a particular person and a particular scarce resource before anybody else had done so, but if instead late-comers were assumed to have ownership claims to goods, then no one would be allowed to do anything with anything as one would have to have all of the late-comers’ consent prior to ever doing what one wanted to do. Neither we, nor our forefathers, nor our progeny could, do, or will survive if one were to follow this rule. In order for any person—past, present, or future—to argue anything it must be possible to survive then and now, and in order to do just this property rights cannot be conceived of as being timeless and nonspecific regarding the number of people involved. Rather, property rights must be thought of as originating as a result of specific individuals acting at definite points in time. Otherwise, it would be impossible for anyone to first say anything at a definite point in time and for someone else to be able to reply. Simply saying that the first-user-first-owner rule of libertarianism can be ignored or is unjustified implies a contradiction, for one’s being able to say so must presuppose one’s existence as an independent decision-making unit at a given point in time.

Finally, acting and proposition-making would also be impossible if the things acquired through homesteading were not defined in objective, physical terms (and if correspondingly, aggression were not defined as an invasion of the physical integrity of another person’s property), but in terms of subjective values and evaluations. While every person can have control over whether or not his actions cause the physical integrity of something to change, control over whether or not one’s actions affect the value of someone’s property rests with other people and their evaluations. One would have to interrogate and come to an agreement with the entire world population to make sure that one’s planned actions would not change another person’s evaluations regarding his property. Surely, everyone would be long dead before this was accomplished. Moreover, the idea that property values should be protected is argumentatively indefensible, for even in order to argue so it must be presupposed that actions must be permitted prior to any actual agreement. (If they were not one could not even make this proposition.) If they are permitted, however, this is only possible because of objective borders of property, i.e., borders which every person can recognize as such on his own without having to agree first with anyone else with respect to one’s system of values and evaluations.

By being alive and formulating any proposition, one demonstrates that any ethic except the libertarian private properly ethic is invalid. If this were not so and late-comers had to have legitimate claims to things or things owned were defined in subjective terms, no one could possibly survive as a physically independent decision-making unit at any given point in time. Hence, no one could ever raise any validityclaiming proposition.

This concludes my a priori justification of the private property ethic. A few comments regarding a topic already touched upon earlier, the relationship of this “praxeological” proof of libertarianism to the utilitarian and to the natural rights position, shall complete the discussion.

As regards the utilitarian position, the proof contains its ultimate refutation. It demonstrates that simply in order to propose the utilitarian position, exclusive rights of control over one’s body and one’s homesteaded goods already must be presupposed as valid. More specifically, as regards the consequentialist aspect of libertarianism, the proof shows its praxeological impossibility: the assignment of rights of exclusive control cannot be dependent on certain outcomes. One could never act and propose anything unless private property rights existed prior to a later outcome. A consequentialist ethic is a praxeological absurdity. Any ethic must instead be “aprioristic” or instantaneous in order to make it possible that one can act here and now and propose this or that rather than having to suspend acting until later. Nobody advocating a wait-for-the-outcome ethic would be around to say anything if he took his own advice seriously. Also, to the extent that utilitarian proponents are still around, they demonstrate through their actions that their consequentialist doctrine is and must be regarded as false. Acting and proposition-making require private property rights now and cannot wait for them to be assigned only later.

As regards the natural rights position, the praxeological proof, generally supportive as it is of the former’s position concerning the possibility of a rational ethic and in full agreement with the conclusions reached within this tradition (specifically, by Murray N. Rothbard), has at least two distinctive advantages. For one thing, it has been a common quarrel with the natural rights position, even on the part of otherwise sympathetic observers, that the concept of human nature is far too diffuse to allow the derivation of a determinate set of rules of conduct. The praxeological approach solves this problem by recognizing that it is not the wider concept of human nature but the narrower one of propositional exchanges and argumentation which must serve as the starting point in deriving an ethic. Moreover, there exists an a priori justification for this choice insofar as the problem of true and false, of right and wrong, does not arise independent of propositional exchanges. No one, then, could possibly challenge such a starting point without contradiction. Finally, it is argumentation which requires the recognition of private property, so an argumentative challenge of the validity of the private property ethic is praxeologically impossible.

Second, there is the logical gap between “is-” and “ought-statements” which natural rights proponents have failed to bridge successfully—except for advancing some general critical remarks regarding the ultimate validity of the fact-value dichotomy. Here the praxeological proof of libertarianism has the advantage of offering a completely value-free justification of private property. It remains entirely in the realm of is-statements and never tries to derive an “ought” from an “is.” The structure of the argument is this: (a) justification is propositional justification—a priori true is-statement; (b) argumentation presupposes property in one’s body and the homesteading principle—a priori true is-statement; and (c) then, no deviation from this ethic can be argumentatively justified—a priori true is-statement. The proof also offers a key to an understanding of the nature of the fact-value dichotomy: Ought-statements cannot be derived from isstatements. They belong to different logical realms. It is also clear, however, that one cannot even state that there are facts and values if no propositional exchanges exist, and that this practice of propositional exchanges in turn presupposes the acceptance of the private property ethic as valid. In other words, cognition and truth-seeking as such have a normative foundation, and the normative foundation on which cognition and truth rest is the recognition of private property rights.
