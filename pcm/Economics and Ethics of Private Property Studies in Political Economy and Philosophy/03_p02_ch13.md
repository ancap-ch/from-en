## For de Ultimate Justification of de Ethics of Private Property

Ludwid von Mises for  im masterpiece Human Action wey im write don show de entire body of economic theory as e be, and as we fit deduce from our own understanding wetin action mean(plus small general assumptions wey talk about de reality where action for dey take place). im call dis conceptual knowledge de "axiom of action", and im demonstrate de sense wey action carry bring economic theory, dat one mean say values, ends, means and choice, preference, profit, loss and cost gats dey considered. e nor dey derived from sense impressions but from reflection (person nor fit see actions but rada person fit interpret some kind physical things as actions!). For sure, e nor fit dey possible to say na wrong thing by any experience, anyhow wey e be, cos any attempt to do so go just be like say we dey assume say action dey and  person wey dey act, him understanding of de types of action (to experience sometin, na intentional action).

So as we don  reconstruct economics as, in de last resort, wey dem get from  one true proposition before, Mises fit claim say im don provide ultimate foundation of economics. im call im so-founded economics “praxeology”, wey mean the logic of action, in order to emphasize de fact sey im propositions fit dey proven by virtue of de action-axiom wey we nor fit argue about and de laws of logical reasoning wey we nor fit argue about too(wey include de laws of identity and contradiction)—wey dey completely independent, wic mean say, e fit stand any kind of test (as e dey used, for example, for physics). Well, even if im idea of praxeology and im thinking of construction of de entire body of praxeological don place am among de great people of de modern Western tradition of rationalism for de search for some foundations like dat, Mises nor think say anoda claim of dis tradition fit dey gud: de claim say oda foundations for inside ethical mata dem dey gud. According to Mises  e nor get ultimate justification wey don dey for ethical propositions de same way wey e dey for economic propositions. Economics fit tell us weda or not certain means  dey correct to bring some kind ends, yet weda or not de ends fit dey regarded as just nor fit dey decided by economics or by any oda science. justification nor dey  for choosing one instead of to choose anoda end. last last, which end dey chosen dey different from a scientific point of view and na mata of subjective whim, wey nor dey capable of any justification pass de small fact of say people like you.

Many libertarians don follow Mises ontop dis mata . just like Mises, dem don abandon de idea of rational foundation of ethics. As im dey do, dem don make enough from de economic proposition of say de libertarian private property ethic dey produce higher general standard to live pass anoda one; say most people dey like higher pass lower standards of living; and so, libertarianism suppose dey popular. But for real, as Mises been know very well , such considerations go only fit convince person wey dey into  libertarianism who don already accept de “utilitarian” plan of general wealth maximization. For dose wey nor gree for dis goal, dem nor get wetin dey drive dem at all. So, finally, libertarianism dey based on notin but arbitrary act of faith.

For dis mata I don outline  argument wey demonstrate why dis position nor fit work well , and how de important Lockean private property ethic of libertarianism fit dey justified. To start, dis argument support de natural rights position of libertarianism as espoused by de master thinker of de modern libertarian movement, Murray N. Rothbard- ontop every for im Ethics of Liberty. Still on still, de argument wey bring de ultimate justification of private property dey different from de one wey de natural rights tradition offer. instead of dis tradition, na Mises, and im idea of praxeology and praxeological proofs, wey fit provide de model.

I follow show say only de libertarian private property ethic fit dey justified argumentatively, cos na im b d  praxeological presupposition of argumentation as such; and say dem fit show any deviating, nonlibertarian ethical proposal make e look like say e dey violate de preference wey we don show. we fit make dat kind proposal, ofcos, but im propositional content go contradict de ethic of which person show im preference by virtue of proposition-making, as in, by de act of engaging in argumentation as such. For example, person fit talk say “people no go always dey interested* wen e come to make dem do sometin”, but dis proposition go cast cos of de very act of proposition making, wey go fit demonstrate subjective preference (ro say dis instead wey we for talk something else or nor even talk anytin at all). Same same, non-libertarian ethical proposals dey show na lie by wetin we already know if im dey propose dose ones.

To reach dis conclusion and to understand how dis one dey important and im logical force, two insights dey very important.

First, make we note say de question of wetin dey just or unjust—or for matter de big general question of wetin dey valid proposition and wetin nor dey inside—fit only arise so far as me and oda people dey  capable of propositional exchanges, as in, to fit argue. De question nor arise through stone or fish cos dem nor fit  engage in dat kind exchanges and to produce propositions wey dey claim validity. But if dis na so—and person nor fit deny say e fit happen without for am to contradict imsef, as person nor fit argue case wey person nor fit argue —den any ethical proposal as well as any oda proposition dey assume say e dey capable of validity by propositional or argumentative means. (Mises, too,  as far as im dey formulate economic propositions, go dey assume sey im claim am.) In fact, to produce any proposition, overtly or as internal thought, person don demonstrate im preference say im dey willing to rely on argument  to convince himself or others of sometin. So, no way fit dey enough to justify anything unless say na justification by means of propositional exchanges and arguments. Anyhow e be, den e must dey considered as de ultimate defeat for ethical proposal if person fit  demonstrate say im content dey logically incompatible with de claim of de person wey dey propose say d legitness go dey correct by argument. To demonstrate dat kind incompatibility go amount to  impossibility proof, and dat kind proof go constitute de most deadly defeat possible in the realm of intellectual inquiry.

Second, we gats note say argumentation nor consist of free-floating propositions but na form of action wey require de use of means wey nor dey easy to reach; and say de means wey person dey carry demonstrate say im like by engaging in propositional exchanges na de means dem of private property. For one thing, nobody fit just propose anything, and no person fit dey convinced of any proposition cos of argumentative means, if we nor already think say de  person get right to make exclusive use of im physical body. na dis recognition of we exclusive mutual  control on top we own body wey explain de distinctive character of propositional exchanges, wey say while man fit disagree about wetin im don talk, e still dey possible to agree at least ontop de fact wey be say disagreement dey. E dey  obvious say property right for we own body gats dey said to be justified a priori, for anybody wey don try  to justify any kind norm go suppose don know de exclusive right of control over him body as valid norm simply in order to say, “I propose dis one and dis one” Any person wey nor support dat kind right go hang for practical contradiction since to argue go already mean say de person don accept the norm wey him nor accept.

As de tori dey go, e go follow dey impossible make we sustain any argument for a long time and come put hope for ontop de propositional force of our argument if we nor get de allowance to appropriate join our own body oda scarce mean dem through homesteading action ( to use dem before anoda person) and if dose kind means and de right dem of exclusive control wey regard dem nor dey defined for objective physical terms. Cos if nor body get right to control anytin else apart from im own body, den we stop exist and de problem wey ontop justifying normal things nor go exist. And so cos we dey alive, we suppose see property rights as sometin wey already dey valid. Nobody wey dey alive fit argue odawise.

Moreova, if person bin nor get de right of exclusive control on top goods like dat through homesteading action, as in, as im establish objective link between one person and one resource wey dey scarce before anoda person do am, but instead people assume say late-comer dem get ownership claim on top goods, den dem nor go allow anybody  do anytin with anytin as person go first nid permission from de late-comer dem before im do wetin im be wan do. We, our forefather dem and we pikin dem nor for survive or go survive if we follow dis kind rule. For anybody to argue anytin – for past – for dis present – and for future, e mean say e dey possible to survive dat time and now. And for us to do beta, we nor fit conceive dis property rights as wetin dey timeless or wetin nor dey specific, regarding de number of people wey follow for de mata. Instead make we think of property rights as sometin cos of people wey dey act for definite point in time. odawise e nor go dey possible for person to first talk sometin for definite point in time and for anoda person to reply am. Just to talk say we fit ignore de first user – first owner rule of libertarianism or e nor dey justified mean say na contradiction, cos if person go fit yarn like dat e mean say de person na independent unit wey fit make decision for one particular time.

Finally to act and to make proposition go also dey impossible if de things wey we get through homesteading bin nor dey defined for objective physical terms ( and if as e correspond, aggression nor mean to invade de physical integrity of anoda person property) but for de terms of subjective value and evaluation. And while person fit get or nor get control over weather im action dey make de  physical integrity of sometin to change. wede im fit or im nor fit control weda im action dey affect de value of anoda person property rest with oda people and dia evaluation. Person no need to interrogate den come agree with world population to make sure say de action dem wey im plan nor go change anoda person evaluation as e concern im property. Surely, everybody go don die taytay before dem go accomplish dis one. moreova e nor dey possible to defend de idea wey say make property value get protection, for even make dem argue e mean say dem go don permit action before any beta agreement (if e nor be so, person nor for fit even make dis kind proposition), if dem dey permitted, howeva, dis one only dey possible cos of de objective border wey property get, as in, border wey every man fit recognise by im self without im to agree first with anoda person cos of im system of value and evaluation dem.

To dey alive dey formulate any proposition, person dey demonstrate sey all ethic except de libertarian private property ethic nor dey valid. If e nor be so and late-comer dem get legitimate claim to de things or things wey dem get  dey defined for subjective terms, no body for fit survive as physically independent unit wey dey make decision for any particular time. And so, no body fit ever raise any proposition wey dey claim validity.

Na dis one conclude my priori justification of de private property ethic. some tori wey regard one topic wey we talk before,  of how dis "praxeological" proof of libertarianism take relate to de utilitarian and to de natural rights position, go complete dis our tori.

As e concern de utilitarian position, de proof dey contain im ultimate refutation. e show say for person to propose de utilitarian position dem must already see exclusive right of control on top im body and im homesteaded goods as wetin dey valid. as e concern de consequentialist corner of libertarianism in particular, de proof dey show im praxeological impossibility de assignment of de rights of exclusive control nor fit depend for some outcome dem. person nor for fit act or propose anytin unless private property rights dey exist already  before any outcome. consequentialist ethic na praxeological absurdity. na eida say ethics be "aprioristic" or e dey happen quick quick to make dey possible so dat person go fit act here and now, and im go fit propose dis one and dat one instead of make im suspend acting until anoda time. E nor get person wey dey support  wait-for-outcome ethic wey go dey around to talk anytin if im take im own advice seriously. And, to de point wey utilitarian proponent dem still dey around, dem dey use action show say we must regard dia consequentialist doctrine as wetin nor be true. To act and to make proposition nid private property right now and e nor go fit wait make dem assign am later.

As e concern de natural rights position, de praxeological proof,  generally supportive as e bin dey with de position of de oda one wey concern de possibility of ethic wey make sense and wey agree with de conclusion wey we reach inside dis tradition (by Murray N. Rothbard in particular) get atleast two important advantage dem. For one thing, e don become wey dey always happen with de natural rights position, even  for de part of sympathetic people wey dey observe, say de ide of human nature  dey too scatter scatter to allow make dem get determinate rules of conduct. when dem use praxeology, e dey solve de problem as e go recognize say nor be de wide idea of man pikin nature but na de narrow idea of propositional exchanges dem and argumentation wey go serve as de beginning to get  rules of behaviour of wetin bad or gud. Moreova, priori justification for dis choice dey exist as far as say de problem of wetin true or wetin false,  wetin wrong or wetin right, nor go come up on im own without propositional exchange dem. Den e nor get anybody wey for fit challenge dat kind starting point unless contradiction go dey. last last, na argumentation wey need make private property recognise am, so nor get any argumentation wey dey challenge weda private property ethic dey valid wey dey praxeologically impossible.

Second, logical gap dey between "is" and "suppose be" statement wey natural rights proponent dem done fail to bridge well – except as dem don advance some general tori wey dey critical as e concern de ultimate validity of de fact-value of things wey dey opposite. For here de praxeological proof wey libertarianism get, get de advantage to give complete value-free justification of private property. Na inside de realm of is-statements wey e go always dey and e nor dey try to get "suppose be" from "is" 
Dis na de structure of dis argument: (a) justification na propositional justification— is-statement wey be priori true
 (b) argumentation dey presuppose sey  person body na property and homesteading principle too— na priori true is-statement; and (c) Den, to say we nor fit justify any oda tori apart from this ethic —na priori true is-statement.
De proof dey give us scope to use understand  de nature of fact-value dichotomy:  we nor fit get Ought-statement dem from Is-statement.Dem dey for different logic realms. e also clear say, howeva, man nor go fit say fact and value dey if propositional exchange dem nor dey exist, and say  if we practise dis propositional exchange e go mean say we don accept say de  Private property ethic dey vaild. To put am another way, to think and to find true talk get correct foundation, and de foundation na say dem recognize private property rights.
