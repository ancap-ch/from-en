## Fallacies of the Public Goods Theory and the Production of Security

In 1849, for the time wen dem classical liberalism be de ideological force wey dey dominate den, and dem dey see "economist" and "socialist" as opposite, Gustave de Molinari, wey be very popular Belgian economist come write say,

> If any one truth wey established wella dey for political economy, na im be dis: For every cases, for all de commodities wey dey serve make e provide tangible or intangible need of the concumers, na for de consumer's beta interest say trade and labor go dey free, cos say de freedom of labor with trade get as one of dia patapata result say price go reduce well well. Dis one also dey: Say de interest of de consumer of any commodity at all go be de koko pass de interest of who produce am. Now, to pursue dis principles, person go come conclude say: As dem dey produce security, e go be in de interest of de consumers wey dey use dis intangible commodity and e go dey under de law of free competition. So e come follow like dis: Say no government supposed get de right to dey prevent anoda government wey wan compete with am, or dey require make consumers of security to only come for dem for dis commodity. [^1]

Him also talk put for dis argument say, "Either dis correct and make sense, or de principles wey economic science dey based on nor correct or invalid."[^2]

As e come be so, na only one sure way dey out for dis unpleasant (for all de socialists, that is) conclusion: wey be say na to argue say particular goods dey wey be say for some special reasons, de economic reasoning nor apply to am at all. Na dis matter de so-called public goods theorists dey seriously wan prove so.[^3] But as e come be so, me go demonstrate say dat kind special goods or special reasons nor exist ka ka, and also say de production of security nor even dey cause problem wey even different from de ones wey dem take dey produce any other goods or services, like say house, cheese or insurance sef. Even tho say e get many followers, de whole theory of public goods dey faulty wella, de reasoning nor bam, and plenty inconsistencies full am, even de argument nor even follow, and e just dey play on people dey believe or assume but e nor get any scientific merit at all.[^4]

So, wetin come be de way wey socialist economists come find to take avoid Molinari's conclusion come be? Since dem Molinari's time, e come even dey common to dey answer yes to de question about say if goods wey different kinds of economic analyses dey apply to. De true matter be say, e dey almost impossible to fit find even one contemporary economics textbook wey nor stress de importance wey dey between private goods, wey be say de truth of de economic superiority wey dem dey admit for capitalist order of production, with public goods, wey dem dey generally deny am.[^5] Some kind goods and services (security also join) dey wey dem dey call special unto say to enjoy dem nor dey restricted for only dose wey provide de money wey dem take produce am. But instead, even people wey nor finance dem at all also dey get benefits from am. Dem dey call dem public goods or services (wey different wella from private goods or services, wey dey onlly benefit dose wey kuku pay for am). Cos of dis special feature wey public goods get, dem don argue am say, markets nor go fit produce dem, especially for quantity and quality matter, so dem require state wey go compensate am.[^6]

De kind examples wey different authors don give for public goods different wella. Authors dey usually classify de same good or service differently, and e go come leave almost no classification of any particular good nor get dispute, wey dey clearly cover de fact say de whole distinction nor real.[^7] But still, some examples wey dey enjoy one kind popular status as public goods na de fire brigade wey dey stop neighbor's house make e nor catch fire, so dat he go come get profit from my fire brigade, but him nor provide any money wey dem take run am; or even de police wey be say if dem dey waka for my property dem go drive away dem burglar's from even my neighbor'sproperty sef, even tho him pay for de patrols; or even de lighthouse wey especially dem economists like wella,[^8] wey dey help ship dey find dia way even tho who get de ship nor contribute even kobo wey dem take build am or maintain am.

Before i continue for dis presentation and serious examination of public goods theory, i go investigate how de difference between private and public goods dey useful wen e dey help to decide wetin dem supposed produce privately and also wetin dem supposed to be provided by the state or by de state help. Even say de most superficial analysis nor fit even fail to point out say to dey use de alleged criterion of inexccludability, instead of to present solution wey dey make sense, e go make one enter deep trouble. Wen u dey look am de first time, e dey be like say some of de goods and services wey de state dey provide fit qualify as public goods, but e nor dey clear many of de goods and services de state actually produce go dey under public goods. Railroads, postal services, telephone, streets and others de be like goods wey be say na dose people wey pay money put dey use am, and so dem come dey be like private goods. And na dat even be de case wey concern many aspects of dat multidimensional good wey be "security": dem fit call anytin wey dem fit take insurance from as private good. And still e nor go be enough. Just as many goods wey de state provide be like private goods, na so many goods wey dem produced privately also dey be de category of public good. As in, my neighbors fit enjoy my rose garden wey i maintain wella\---dem fit just dey enjoy dey look am even say dem nor dey help me for de garden. De same dey true for all kinds improvements wey i fit make for my property fit boost de value of my neigbors property too. Even people wey no dey put money for street's musician cap fit also enjoy him performance. Even dose my fellow passengers for bus wey nor help me buy my deodorant also profit from am. And all de people wey ever meet me go profits from my efforts, wey i run even tho dem nor help me with money, wey i use turn myself into a lovable person. Make u look all dis now\---rose gardens, property improvements, street music, deodorants, personal improvements\---since dem clearly get characteristics of public goods, make dem come dey provided by de state or with hep of the state?

As all dis examples of d goods wey dem privately produced show, sometin dey seriously wrong with de thesis of public goods theorists wey dem say dem nor go fit produce public good privately, but e go instead need de intervention of the state. As e clear so, de markets fit provide dem. As e come be, evidence for history show us say all dose so-called public goods wey de states dey provide now at some time for de past private entrepreneurs dey provide dem or even today dem dey provide am for one country or anoda. For example, de postal service na private before for almost everywhere; dem dey privately pay money for street light and dem even still dey do am sometimes; even lighthouse wey people love na private enterprise work before;[^9] private police forces, detectives, and arbitrators even dey exist too; and also help for de sick, de poor and de old ones, orphans and widows na usually traditional concern for dem private charity organizations. To talk say, pure market system nor fit produced dose kind things na big lie from experience.

Apart from dis one, other difficulties go come come out especially wen dem use public-private differences to decide wetin and wetin dem nor go leave for de market. For instance, wat if de production of so-called public goods nor go get positive but get negative consequences for other people, or if de consequences go positive for some people and negative for other people? Wat if de neighbor wey dia house dem save from burning by my fire brigade dey wished (maybe cos him dey overinsured) say de house burned down; or say my neighbors hate roses, or my fellow passengers dey find de scent of my deodorant disgusting? Also, de changes for technology fit change de character of dat good. For example, as dem develop cable TV wey formerly (seemingly) be public good don turn private now. And changes for the lwas of property\---wey dem take appropriate de property\---fit get same effects to fit change de public-private character of a good. For instance, de lighthouse na public good as far say de sea na publicly(not privately) owned. But if dem come require us to get small pieces of de ocean as private property, as e for be for purely capitalist social order, den as de lighthouse dey shine pass only small area, e fit come possible den make dem remove dose wey nor pay money from enjoying e services.

If we leave dis somehow confusing level of discussion and if we look into de difference between private and public goods wella, we go comefind out say de difference nor hold water. A clear-cut difference between private and public goods nor exist, and dis na de main reason why many disagreements dey on how dem go take classify a given good. All goods dey more or less private or public and fit\---and dey usually do\---change with respect to dia level of privateness/publicness as people's values and evaluations dey change, and as change dey happen in how dem take compose de population. In order say dem nor go ever fall, once and for all, into either one or de other category, we must remember wetin dey make something a good. For something to be a good, e must be recognized and seen as scarce by anoda person. Something nor be good as such, na to say; goods are goods for de eyes of who dey look am. Notin go be a good unless one person check am wella and see am like dat. Even den, wen goods nor be goods-as-such\---wen no physico-chemical analysis fit identify sometin say na economic good\---so no fixed or objective criteria wey dem take dey classify goods as say na private or public. Dem nor go fit be private or public goods like dat. Dia private or public character dey depends on how many people dey consider dem as goods, with de level wey dem take be private or public dey change as all dis evaluations dey change and range from one to infinity. Even things wey dey completely be like private like de inside of my house or de color of my pant fit come be public goods wen other people come dey care about am.[^10] And even things wey dey be like public goods, like de outside of my house or de colors of my dress, fit become serious private goods wen people nor come dey care about am again. Even sef, every good fit change e characteristics every time; e fit even change from a public or private good to a public or private bad or evil or vice versa, and e dey depends wella on de changes weda dem care or dem nor care. If na so e come be, den no decision fit be based on de classification of goods say na private or public.[^11] In fact ehn, to do am like dat e go become necessary make dem ask almost every body as e concern every single good weda or not e care abput am\---positively or negatively and like to how much\---in order make dem determine who go profit from am and who go participate for financing de goods. (And how one wan take know if dem dey tell de truth?) E go also become necessary to dey monitor all de changes for such evaluations every time, with de result say no definite decision go fit dey made as far say e concern de production of anytin, and na consequence of a theory wey nor make sense at all and all of us for don die tey-tey.[^12]

But even if person wan even ignore all dis wahala and dem ready to admit, cos of argument say de private-public good difference nor hold water, de argument nor go prove wetin e supposed to. E nor provide beta reasons why public goods\---assuming say dem exist as separate category of goods\---dem go produce am at all, and why de state instead of private enterprises go produce dem. Na dat de theory of public goods dey talk, as dem don introduced de conceptual difference: The positive effects of goods for people nor contribute anytin for dia production or na dia financing dey prove say all dis goods dey desirable. But last lastdem nor go produce am, or at least not in de correct quality or quantity, for a free, or market wey competition dey, since nor be all dose wey go profit from dia production goalso provide money wey dem go take produce am. In order make dem for produce dis goods (wich e clear say e dey desirable, but otherwise dem nor go producedam), de state go must assist and join dem for dia production. Dis kind reasoning, wich dem fit find for almost all textbooks for economics (Dem nor exclude Nobel Laureates)[^13]na complete lie for two counts.

For one thing, to come to dat conclusion say de state supposed provide public goods dat say otherwise dem nor go produce am, one supposed put a standard for one's chain of reasoning. Otherwise, from de statement say cos of some special characteristics wey dem get, dem nor go produce some kind goods, one nor fit come reach de conclusion say all dis goods*dem supposed* produced dem. But for dia standard wey dem require make dem taje justify dia conclusion, dem public goods theorists don clearly leave de lane of economics as a positive, *wertfrei* science. But instead dem don move to the lane of morals and ethics, and hence one go expect make dem offered am theory of ethics as a cognitive discipline so dat dem fit legitimately do wetin dem dey try do now and also make dem justify dia conclusion. But dem fit hardly stressed wella say nowhere in public goods theory literature saydem fit find anytin wey even resemble cognitive theory of ethics small.[^14] So i must talk am for de beginning, say public goods theorists dey misuse wateva levels dem fit get as positive economists as dem dey talk put for matters for wich, as dia own writings show, dem nor get any authority at all. Maybe sha, dem don stumbled on something wey correct by accident, but dem nor support am with one kind big moral theory? E come dey show well say notin go far from de truth as soon as person clearly formulates de standard wey dem go need to reach dat conclusion wey be say de state go need help as dem dey produce public goods. De standard wey dem required to reach dat conclusion wey dey up: wen person fit somehow prove say de production of one particular good or service get positive effects for anoda person but dem nor go produced am at all, or dem nor go produce am in clear quantity or quality unless say some people go pay money, den de use of strong force against dose people is allowed, either na directly or na indirectly with de help of de state, and dem fit force dis people make dem share for de financial burden. E nor need much comment to show say gra-gra go happen if dem implement dis kind rule, as e come be like say anybody fit attack anyone wen him feel like am. Also, aas i don demonstrate wella somewhere before[^15] dem nor fit ever justify dis standard say e fair at all. To argue say, in fact to argue at all, to support or oppose anytin, weda na moral, nonmoral, empirical or logico-analytical position, e go for supposed say against wetin de standard dey actually talk, dem go assure each person integrity as an independent decision-making unit. Cos na only if every body dey free from physical gra-gra by other people na im dem for fit talk anytin first den dem fit reach agreement or disagreement or anytin else. The principle of nonaggression na necessary condition wey dem fit dey argue or fit take reach agreement and so dem fit argumentatively defend a just standard as dem use priori reasoning.

[^6]: Anoda criteria wey dem dey use wella for public goods na dat of "nonrivalrous consumption." Normally, both de criteria be like say dem join: When dem nor fit exclude dem free riders, nonrivalrous consumption dey possible; and if dem fit exclude dem, consumption go come dey rivalrous, or na so e seems. But, as public goods theorists dey argue, dis coincidence nor perfect. As dem talk, e dey conceivable say while de eclusion of free riders fit dey possible, dia inclusion fit nor dey connected with any other cost (as in, de marginal cost to admit new free riders na zero), and say de consumption of de good wey we dey talk about by de other free riders wey dem admit nor go necessarily lead to where de goods wey dey available to others nor go reduce. Dat kind good go also be a public good, too. And since exclusion would be practiced on the free market and the good would not become available for nonrivalrous consumption to everyone it otherwise could—even though this would require no additional costs—this, according to statist-socialist logic, would prove a market failure, i.e., a suboptimal level of consumption. Hence the state would have to take over the provision of such goods. (A movie theater, for instance, might be only half full, so it might be “costless” to admit additional viewers free of charge, and their watching the movie also might not affect the paying viewers; hence the movie would qualify as a public good. Since, however, the owner of the theater would be engaging in exclusion, instead of letting free riders enjoy a “costless” performance, movie theaters would be ripe for nationalization.) On the numerous fallacies involved in defining public goods in terms of nonrivalrous consumption see notes 12 and 17 below.

[^10]: See, for instance, the ironic case that Block makes for socks being public goods in “Public Goods and Externalities.”

[^11]: To avoid any misunderstanding here, every single producer and every association of producers making joint decisions can, at any time, decide whether or not to produce a good based on an evaluation of the privateness or publicness of the good. In fact, decisions on whether or not to produce public goods privately are constantly made within the framework of a market economy. What is impossible is to decide whether or not to ignore the outcome of the operation of a free market based on the assessment of the degree of privateness or publicness of a good.

[^12]: In fact, then, the introduction of the distinction between private and public goods is a relapse into the pre-subjectivist era of economics. From the point of view of subjectivist economics, no good exists that can be categorized objectively as private or public. This is essentially why the second proposed criterion for public goods—permitting nonrivalrous consumption (see note 6 above)—breaks down too. For how could any outside observer determine whether or not the admittance of an additional free rider at no charge would not indeed lead to a subtraction in the consumption of a good to others? Clearly there is no way that he could objectively do so. In fact, it might well be that one’s enjoyment of a movie or of driving on a road would be considerably reduced if more people were allowed in the theater or on the road. Again, to find out whether or not this is the case one would have to ask every individual—and not everyone might agree (what then?). Furthermore, since even a good that allows nonrivalrous consumption is not a free good, as a consequence of admitting additional free riders “crowding” would eventually occur, and hence everyone would have to be asked about the appropriate “margin.” In addition, my consumption may or may not be affected depending on who it is that is admitted free of charge, so I would have to be asked about this, too. And finally, everyone might change his opinion on all of these questions over time. It is thus in the same way impossible to decide whether or not a good is a candidate for state (rather than private) production based on the criterion of nonrivalrous consumption as on that of nonexcludability (see also note 17 below).

Hayek, *Law, Legislation and Liberty* (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1979), vol. 3, chap. 14.

[^14]: Economists in recent years, particularly the Chicago School, have been increasingly concerned with the analysis of property rights. Harold Demsetz, “The Exchange and Enforcement of Property Rights,” *Journal of Law and Economics* 7 (1964); idem, “Toward a Theory of Property Rights,” *American Economic Review* (1967); Ronald Coase, “The Problem of Social Cost,” *Journal of Law and Economics* 3 (1960); Armen Alchian, *Economic Forces at Work* (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1977), part 2; Richard Posner, *Economic Analysis of the Law* (Boston: Brown, 1977). But dose kind analysis nor get anytin to do with ethics. On the contrary, they represent attempts to substitute economic efficiency considerations for the establishment of justifiable ethical principles [on the critique of such endeavors see Murray N. Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty* (Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Humanities Press, 1982), chap. 26; Walter Block, “Coase and Demsetz on Private Property Rights,” *Journal of Libertarian Studies* 1, no. 2 (1977); Ronald Dworkin, “Is Wealth a Value,” *Journal of Legal Studies* 9 (1980); Murray N. Rothbard, “The Myth of Efficiency,” in Mario Rizzo, ed., *Time Uncertainty and Disequilibrium* (Lexington, Mass.: D.C. Heath, 1979). Ultimately, all efficiency arguments are irrelevant because there simply exists no nonarbitrary way of measuring, weighing, and aggregating individual utilities or disutilities that result from some given allocation of property rights. Hence any attempt to recommend some particular system of assigning property rights in terms of its alleged maximization of “social welfare” is pseudo-scientific humbug. See in particular, Murray N. Rothbard, *Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics* (New York: Center for Libertarian Studies, Occasional Paper Series No. 3, 1977); also Lionel Robbins, “Economics and Political Economy,” *American Economic Review* (1981).

The “Unanimity Principle” which Buchanan and Tullock, following Knut Wicksell (*Finanztheoretische Untersuchungen*, Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1896), have repeatedly proposed as a guide for economic policy is also not to be confused with an ethical principle proper. According to this principle only such policy changes should be enacted which can find unanimous consent—and that surely sounds attractive; but then, *mutatis mutandis*, it also determines that the status quo be preserved if there is less than unanimous agreement on any proposal of change—and that sounds far less attractive, because it implies that any given, present state of affairs regarding the allocation of property rights must be legitimate either as a point of departure or as a to-be-continued-state. However, the public choice theorists offer no justification in terms of a normative theory of property rights for this daring claim as would be required. Hence, the unanimity principle is ultimately without ethical foundation. In fact, because it would legitimize any conceivable status quo, the Buchananites’ most favored principle is no less than outrightly absurd as a moral criterion. See on this also Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty* chap. 26; idem, “The Myth of Neutral Taxation,” pp. 549f.

But wetin come remain for dis unanimity princple, Buchanan and Tullock, as dem follow de lead of Wicksell again, dem come give am away again as dem reduce am in effect to one of "relative" or "quasi" unanimity.
