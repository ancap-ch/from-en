## Fallacies of the Public Goods Theory and the Production of Security

In 1849, for the time wen dem classical liberalism be de ideological force wey dey dominate den, and dem dey see "economist" and "socialist" as opposite, Gustave de Molinari, wey be very popular Belgian economist come write say,

> If any one truth wey established wella dey for political economy, na im be dis: For every cases, for all de commodities wey dey serve make e provide tangible or intangible need of the concumers, na for de consumer's beta interest say trade and labor go dey free, cos say de freedom of labor with trade get as one of dia patapata result say price go reduce well well. Dis one also dey: Say de interest of de consumer of any commodity at all go be de koko pass de interest of who produce am. Now, to pursue dis principles, person go come conclude say: As dem dey produce security, e go be in de interest of de consumers wey dey use dis intangible commodity and e go dey under de law of free competition. So e come follow like dis: Say no government supposed get de right to dey prevent anoda government wey wan compete with am, or dey require make consumers of security to only come for dem for dis commodity. [^1]

Him also talk put for dis argument say, "Either dis correct and make sense, or de principles wey economic science dey based on nor correct or invalid."[^2]

As e come be so, na only one sure way dey out for dis unpleasant (for all de socialists, that is) conclusion: wey be say na to argue say particular goods dey wey be say for some special reasons, de economic reasoning nor apply to am at all. Na dis matter de so-called public goods theorists dey seriously wan prove so.[^3] But as e come be so, me go demonstrate say dat kind special goods or special reasons nor exist ka ka, and also say de production of security nor even dey cause problem wey even different from de ones wey dem take dey produce any other goods or services, like say house, cheese or insurance sef. Even tho say e get many followers, de whole theory of public goods dey faulty wella, de reasoning nor bam, and plenty inconsistencies full am, even de argument nor even follow, and e just dey play on people dey believe or assume but e nor get any scientific merit at all.[^4]

So, wetin come be de way wey socialist economists come find to take avoid Molinari's conclusion come be? Since dem Molinari's time, e come even dey common to dey answer yes to de question about say if goods wey different kinds of economic analyses dey apply to. De true matter be say, e dey almost impossible to fit find even one contemporary economics textbook wey nor stress de importance wey dey between private goods, wey be say de truth of de economic superiority wey dem dey admit for capitalist order of production, with public goods, wey dem dey generally deny am.[^5] Some kind goods and services (security also join) dey wey dem dey call special unto say to enjoy dem nor dey restricted for only dose wey provide de money wey dem take produce am. But instead, even people wey nor finance dem at all also dey get benefits from am. Dem dey call dem public goods or services (wey different wella from private goods or services, wey dey onlly benefit dose wey kuku pay for am). Cos of dis special feature wey public goods get, dem don argue am say, markets nor go fit produce dem, especially for quantity and quality matter, so dem require state wey go compensate am.[^6]

De kind examples wey different authors don give for public goods different wella. Authors dey usually classify de same good or service differently, and e go come leave almost no classification of any particular good nor get dispute, wey dey clearly cover de fact say de whole distinction nor real.[^7] But still, some examples wey dey enjoy one kind popular status as public goods na de fire brigade wey dey stop neighbor's house make e nor catch fire, so dat he go come get profit from my fire brigade, but him nor provide any money wey dem take run am; or even de police wey be say if dem dey waka for my property dem go drive away dem burglar's from even my neighbor'sproperty sef, even tho him pay for de patrols; or even de lighthouse wey especially dem economists like wella,[^8] wey dey help ship dey find dia way even tho who get de ship nor contribute even kobo wey dem take build am or maintain am.

Before i continue for dis presentation and serious examination of public goods theory, i go investigate how de difference between private and public goods dey useful wen e dey help to decide wetin dem supposed produce privately and also wetin dem supposed to be provided by the state or by de state help. Even say de most superficial analysis nor fit even fail to point out say to dey use de alleged criterion of inexccludability, instead of to present solution wey dey make sense, e go make one enter deep trouble. Wen u dey look am de first time, e dey be like say some of de goods and services wey de state dey provide fit qualify as public goods, but e nor dey clear many of de goods and services de state actually produce go dey under public goods. Railroads, postal services, telephone, streets and others de be like goods wey be say na dose people wey pay money put dey use am, and so dem come dey be like private goods. And na dat even be de case wey concern many aspects of dat multidimensional good wey be "security": dem fit call anytin wey dem fit take insurance from as private good. And still e nor go be enough. Just as many goods wey de state provide be like private goods, na so many goods wey dem produced privately also dey be de category of public good. As in, my neighbors fit enjoy my rose garden wey i maintain wella\---dem fit just dey enjoy dey look am even say dem nor dey help me for de garden. De same dey true for all kinds improvements wey i fit make for my property fit boost de value of my neigbors property too. Even people wey no dey put money for street's musician cap fit also enjoy him performance. Even dose my fellow passengers for bus wey nor help me buy my deodorant also profit from am. And all de people wey ever meet me go profits from my efforts, wey i run even tho dem nor help me with money, wey i use turn myself into a lovable person. Make u look all dis now\---rose gardens, property improvements, street music, deodorants, personal improvements\---since dem clearly get characteristics of public goods, make dem come dey provided by de state or with hep of the state?

As all dis examples of d goods wey dem privately produced show, sometin dey seriously wrong with de thesis of public goods theorists wey dem say dem nor go fit produce public good privately, but e go instead need de intervention of the state. As e clear so, de markets fit provide dem. As e come be, evidence for history show us say all dose so-called public goods wey de states dey provide now at some time for de past private entrepreneurs dey provide dem or even today dem dey provide am for one country or anoda. For example, de postal service na private before for almost everywhere; dem dey privately pay money for street light and dem even still dey do am sometimes; even lighthouse wey people love na private enterprise work before;[^9] private police forces, detectives, and arbitrators even dey exist too; and also help for de sick, de poor and de old ones, orphans and widows na usually traditional concern for dem private charity organizations. To talk say, pure market system nor fit produced dose kind things na big lie from experience.

Apart from dis one, other difficulties go come come out especially wen dem use public-private differences to decide wetin and wetin dem nor go leave for de market. For instance, wat if de production of so-called public goods nor go get positive but get negative consequences for other people, or if de consequences go positive for some people and negative for other people? Wat if de neighbor wey dia house dem save from burning by my fire brigade dey wished (maybe cos him dey overinsured) say de house burned down; or say my neighbors hate roses, or my fellow passengers dey find de scent of my deodorant disgusting? Also, de changes for technology fit change de character of dat good. For example, as dem develop cable TV wey formerly (seemingly) be public good don turn private now. And changes for the lwas of property\---wey dem take appropriate de property\---fit get same effects to fit change de public-private character of a good. For instance, de lighthouse na public good as far say de sea na publicly(not privately) owned. But if dem come require us to get small pieces of de ocean as private property, as e for be for purely capitalist social order, den as de lighthouse dey shine pass only small area, e fit come possible den make dem remove dose wey nor pay money from enjoying e services.

If we leave dis somehow confusing level of discussion and if we look into de difference between private and public goods wella, we go comefind out say de difference nor hold water. A clear-cut difference between private and public goods nor exist, and dis na de main reason why many disagreements dey on how dem go take classify a given good. All goods dey more or less private or public and fit\---and dey usually do\---change with respect to dia level of privateness/publicness as people's values and evaluations dey change, and as change dey happen in how dem take compose de population. In order say dem nor go ever fall, once and for all, into either one or de other category, we must remember wetin dey make something a good. For something to be a good, e must be recognized and seen as scarce by anoda person. Something nor be good as such, na to say; goods are goods for de eyes of who dey look am. Notin go be a good unless one person check am wella and see am like dat. Even den, wen goods nor be goods-as-such\---wen no physico-chemical analysis fit identify sometin say na economic good\---so no fixed or objective criteria wey dem take dey classify goods as say na private or public. Dem nor go fit be private or public goods like dat. Dia private or public character dey depends on how many people dey consider dem as goods, with de level wey dem take be private or public dey change as all dis evaluations dey change and range from one to infinity. Even things wey dey completely be like private like de inside of my house or de color of my pant fit come be public goods wen other people come dey care about am.[^10] And even things wey dey be like public goods, like de outside of my house or de colors of my dress, fit become serious private goods wen people nor come dey care about am again. Even sef, every good fit change e characteristics every time; e fit even change from a public or private good to a public or private bad or evil or vice versa, and e dey depends wella on de changes weda dem care or dem nor care. If na so e come be, den no decision fit be based on de classification of goods say na private or public.[^11] In fact ehn, to do am like dat e go become necessary make dem ask almost every body as e concern every single good weda or not e care abput am\---positively or negatively and like to how much\---in order make dem determine who go profit from am and who go participate for financing de goods. (And how one wan take know if dem dey tell de truth?) E go also become necessary to dey monitor all de changes for such evaluations every time, with de result say no definite decision go fit dey made as far say e concern de production of anytin, and na consequence of a theory wey nor make sense at all and all of us for don die tey-tey.[^12]

But even if person wan even ignore all dis wahala and dem ready to admit, cos of argument say de private-public good difference nor hold water, de argument nor go prove wetin e supposed to. E nor provide beta reasons why public goods\---assuming say dem exist as separate category of goods\---dem go produce am at all, and why de state instead of private enterprises go produce dem. Na dat de theory of public goods dey talk, as dem don introduced de conceptual difference: The positive effects of goods for people nor contribute anytin for dia production or na dia financing dey prove say all dis goods dey desirable. But last lastdem nor go produce am, or at least not in de correct quality or quantity, for a free, or market wey competition dey, since nor be all dose wey go profit from dia production goalso provide money wey dem go take produce am. In order make dem for produce dis goods (wich e clear say e dey desirable, but otherwise dem nor go producedam), de state go must assist and join dem for dia production. Dis kind reasoning, wich dem fit find for almost all textbooks for economics (Dem nor exclude Nobel Laureates)[^13]na complete lie for two counts.

For one thing, to come to dat conclusion say de state supposed provide public goods dat say otherwise dem nor go produce am, one supposed put a standard for one's chain of reasoning. Otherwise, from de statement say cos of some special characteristics wey dem get, dem nor go produce some kind goods, one nor fit come reach de conclusion say all dis goods*dem supposed* produced dem. But for dia standard wey dem require make dem taje justify dia conclusion, dem public goods theorists don clearly leave de lane of economics as a positive, *wertfrei* science. But instead dem don move to the lane of morals and ethics, and hence one go expect make dem offered am theory of ethics as a cognitive discipline so dat dem fit legitimately do wetin dem dey try do now and also make dem justify dia conclusion. But dem fit hardly stressed wella say nowhere in public goods theory literature saydem fit find anytin wey even resemble cognitive theory of ethics small.[^14] So i must talk am for de beginning, say public goods theorists dey misuse wateva levels dem fit get as positive economists as dem dey talk put for matters for wich, as dia own writings show, dem nor get any authority at all. Maybe sha, dem don stumbled on something wey correct by accident, but dem nor support am with one kind big moral theory? E come dey show well say notin go far from de truth as soon as person clearly formulates de standard wey dem go need to reach dat conclusion wey be say de state go need help as dem dey produce public goods. De standard wey dem required to reach dat conclusion wey dey up: wen person fit somehow prove say de production of one particular good or service get positive effects for anoda person but dem nor go produced am at all, or dem nor go produce am in clear quantity or quality unless say some people go pay money, den de use of strong force against dose people is allowed, either na directly or na indirectly with de help of de state, and dem fit force dis people make dem share for de financial burden. E nor need much comment to show say gra-gra go happen if dem implement dis kind rule, as e come be like say anybody fit attack anyone wen him feel like am. Also, aas i don demonstrate wella somewhere before[^15] dem nor fit ever justify dis standard say e fair at all. To argue say, in fact to argue at all, to support or oppose anytin, weda na moral, nonmoral, empirical or logico-analytical position, e go for supposed say against wetin de standard dey actually talk, dem go assure each person integrity as an independent decision-making unit. Cos na only if every body dey free from physical gra-gra by other people na im dem for fit talk anytin first den dem fit reach agreement or disagreement or anytin else. The principle of nonaggression na necessary condition wey dem fit dey argue or fit take reach agreement and so dem fit argumentatively defend a just standard as dem use priori reasoning.

[^6]: Anoda criteria wey dem dey use wella for public goods na dat of "nonrivalrous consumption." Normally, both de criteria be like say dem join: When dem nor fit exclude dem free riders, nonrivalrous consumption dey possible; and if dem fit exclude dem, consumption go come dey rivalrous, or na so e seems. But, as public goods theorists dey argue, dis coincidence nor perfect. As dem talk, e dey conceivable say while de eclusion of free riders fit dey possible, dia inclusion fit nor dey connected with any other cost (as in, de marginal cost to admit new free riders na zero), and say de consumption of de good wey we dey talk about by de other free riders wey dem admit nor go necessarily lead to where de goods wey dey available to others nor go reduce. Dat kind good go also be a public good, too. And since dem go need practice exclusion for free market and de good nor go come dey available for nonrivalrous consumption for everyone otherwise e come\---even if say dis one nor go require any other costs\---dis, according to statis-socialist logic, go make de market fail, and dat means say de level of consumption nor go optimal. And so, de state go need take over de provision of dat goods. (A movie tjeater, for example, fit dey half-full, so e come be "costless" if dem admit other viewers free of charge, and as dem dey watch de movie, e fit nor dose wey pay; and so de movie go qualify as a public good. But since de owner of de theater go dey run exclusion, instead make him let dem free riders enjoy "costless" performance, movie theaters go come reach for nationalization.) On de plenty fallacies wey dey involved wen dem dey define public goods in terms of nonrivalrous consumption check notes 12 and 17 below.

[^11]: To avoid any misunderstanding for here, all de single producer and all de association of dem producers wey dey make joint decision fit, for any time, decide weda or not make dem produce goods based on dia evaluation of de privateness or publicness of de good. In fact, dem dey make decisions on say weda or not make dem produce public goods privately for around de framework of de market economy. Wetin come dey impossible na to decide weda or not to ignore de outcome wey dem take dey operate free market based on how dem take assess de level of privateness or publicness of a good.

[^12]: In fact, den, de introduction of de difference between private and public goods na fall-back to de pre-subjectivist era of economics. From de point of view of dem subjectivist economics, no good exists wey fit be categorized wella as private or public. Dis na de main reason why de second criterion wey dem proposed for public goods\---permitting nonrivalrous consumption (check note 6 above)\---also dey break down too. How person wey dey observe from outside fit determine weda or not say to admit free rider without dem nor charge am go indeed to where dem go substract de consumption of a good to others? As e clear so no way wey he go fit actually do am. In facr, e fit be say person enjoyment of a movie or dey drive for road fit be reduced if dem allowed more people to enter de theater or drive for de road. Again, to fit find out weda or not dis na de case, person go need to dey ask every body\---and nor be every body go agree(wetin go happen den?). Also, since even a good wey allow nonrivalrous consumption nor be free good, as a result say many other free riders go dey admitted, "crowding" go happen, and so dem go come dey ask every body de appropriate "margin". Also, my own consumption fit or fit not dey affected depending on who dem admitted free of charged, so dem go also ask me about dis one too. And finally, every body fit change dia opinion for all dis question as time dey go on. Na dis same way dey make am impossible to fit decide weda or not a good na candidate for state(instead of for private) production based on de criterion of nonrivalrous comsumption even as for dat of nonexcludability (also check note 17 below).

Hayek, *Law, Legislation and Liberty* (Chicago: University of Chicago, 1979), vol. 3, chap. 14.

[^14]: Economists for recent years, especially for Chicago School, dey concerned wella with de analysis of property rights. Harold Demsetz, “The Exchange and Enforcement of Property Rights,” *Journal of Law and Economics* 7 (1964); idem, “Toward a Theory of Property Rights,” *American Economic Review* (1967); Ronald Coase, “The Problem of Social Cost,” *Journal of Law and Economics* 3 (1960); Armen Alchian, *Economic Forces at Work* (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1977), part 2; Richard Posner, *Economic Analysis of the Law* (Boston: Brown, 1977). But dose kind analysis nor get anytin to do with ethics. For de contrary, dem represent attempts to change economic efficiency matter make dem take justify de establishment of ethical principles [to check such endeavors, see Murray N. Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty* (Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Humanities Press, 1982), chap. 26; Walter Block, “Coase and Demsetz on Private Property Rights,” *Journal of Libertarian Studies* 1, no. 2 (1977); Ronald Dworkin, “Is Wealth a Value,” *Journal of Legal Studies* 9 (1980); Murray N. Rothbard, “The Myth of Efficiency,” in Mario Rizzo, ed., *Time Uncertainty and Disequilibrium* (Lexington, Mass.: D.C. Heath, 1979). Last last, all efficiency arguments nor relevant at all cos nonarbitrary way wey dem fit take measure, weigh or measure people utilities or disutilities exists wey result from allocation of property rights wey dem give dem. So any attempt to recommend one kind particular system wey dem go take assign property rights in terms of e alleged maximization of "social welfare" na pseudo-scientific humbug. Check dis one, Murray N. Rothbard, *Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics* (New York: Center for Libertarian Studies, Occasional Paper Series No. 3, 1977); also Lionel Robbins, “Economics and Political Economy,” *American Economic Review* (1981).

The “Unanimity Principle” wey Buchanan and Tullock, as dem follow Knut Wicksell (*Finanztheoretische Untersuchungen*, Jena: Gustav Fischer, 1896), as dem repeatedly propose am as a guide for economic policy make dem nor confuse am with an ethical principle proper. According to dis principle only na dose policy changes dem supposed enact wey go fit find unanimous consent\---and dat dey really sounds attractive; but ehn, *mutatis mutandis*, e also determine say de status quo go dey preserved if e nor reach unanimous agreement for any proposal of change\---and dat nor sound attractive at all, cos say e come mean say any given, de present state of affairs regarding de allocation of property rights go need legitimate either say na point of departure or as a to-be-continued-state. But also, de choice of de public theorists nor offer any justification in terms of a normative theory of property rights for dis kind bold claim as dem go require am. So, de unainimity principle nor get any ethical foundation at all. In fact, cos e go legitimized any status quo dem fit imagine, de Buchanites principle wey dem favor wella nor just bam or make sense as a moral criterion. Also check dis one Rothbard, *The Ethics of Liberty* chap. 26; idem, “The Myth of Neutral Taxation,” pp. 549f.

But wetin come remain for dis unanimity princple, Buchanan and Tullock, as dem follow de lead of Wicksell again, dem come give am away again as dem reduce am in effect to one of "relative" or "quasi" unanimity.
