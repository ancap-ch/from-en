As many great and innovative economists don do, Ludwig von Mises don intensively and repeatedly analyze de problem wey concern de logical status of economic propositions (i.e., how we come know dem and how we take dey validate dem). True true, Mises dey rank foremost among dose wey get the opinion say such a concern dey indispensable in order to achieve systematic progress for economics, for any misconception regarding de answer to such fundamental questions of one’s intellectual enterprise go lead to intellectual disaster, i.e., to false economic doctrines. As e be like dat, three of Mises’s books dey devoted to clarifying de logical foundations of economics: E early *Epistemological Problems of Economics*,wey dem published for German in 1933; e *Deory and History* in 1957; and e *Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science* in 1962, Mises’s last book, wey appear when he don already pass e eightieth birthday wella.  E works for de field of economics proper invariably dey show de importance wey Mises attached to de analysis of epistemological problems. Most characteristically, *Human Action*, his masterpiece, don deal for e first hundred odd pages exclusively with such problems, and de remaining nearly 800 pages of de book dey permeated with epistemological considerations.

De way e dey be with the tradition of Mises, de foundations of economics nai also be the subject for this chapter. I don set for myself a goal wey be twofold. First, I go explain de solution wey Mises bin give concerning the problem of de ultimate foundation of economic science (i.e., e idea wey  dey imagine pure deory of action, or praxeology, as he himself call am). Secondly, I go demonstrate why de solution wey Mises give dey more dan just insight wey nobody fit argue into de nature of economics and economic propositions.

Mises don provide insight wey go also enable us understand de foundation for where epistemology sitdown put. In fact, as de title of de chapter suggests, I go show say na praxeology wey gats dey regarded as de very foundation of epistemology, and say Mises, in addition to e great achievements as an economist, also contribute pathbreaking insights we concern de justification of de entire enterprise of rationalist philosophy.[^1]
