## Preface for de First Edition

De collapse of Socialism for Eastern Europe\---as e show wella by the events wey happen for November 9, 1989 wey dey forever memorable, wen be say de Germans wey dey both East and West come reunited, dem moved and dey happy wella, on top of de Berlin Wall\---don even add plenty support to the main koko of this volume, even more than me be even hoped for sef.

Weda all dis studies concern ecomic topics like employment, interest, money, banking, business cycles, taes, public goods or even growth sef; with philosophical wahala as foundations of knowledge, and particularly for economic and ethics; or even if na de reconstruction and theoretical explanation of sociological phenomena of things wey hapen long ago like exploitation, de rise and fall of civilizations, international politics, war, imperialism, and eeven de work of ideas and ideological movements during de process of social evolution\---each of dem come dey ultimately contributes to just one conclusion: De right to private property nor be wetin dem dey argue about cos say e valid, and de total principle of ethics wey be de basis for "normal" economic progress to dey continue. To rise from de ruins of socialism and overcome de stagnation of de Western welfare states, notin fit reach pass total privatization of everytin dem socialized before, and dem be, government, property and dem need establish a society wey be like contract wey go dey based on say dem go totally recognized de rights of private property.

As i dey write all dis studies, me get help from many places. Me specially thank my Wifey Margaret, who take de task of de-Germanizing my English; to Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., wey be presido of de Ludwig von Mises Institute, and also to Burton S. Blumert, wey b presido of de Center for Libertarian Studies, for dia support for my work; and to my friend, David Gordon, for him plenty suggestions and comments wey too much.

My biggest debt na to Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard, wey be d twentieth century's two greatest-though much neglected-economists and social philosophers. Even tho say me neva see Ludwig von Mises, and me be neva even hear of him name before except after him don die, i dey fortunate say i dey closely flow with Murray Rothbard for de past six years so, de first time na for New York City, and since 1986 we be same colleagues for University pf Nevada, Las Vegas. Apart say i dey owe am intellectual debt, words nor fit express my personal gratitude to am. Him wisdom, insight, kindness, enthusiasm and him constant encouragement dey always inspire me. Na cos of that make me dedicate this volume to am.
