### De Austrians School of Economics and de Prospects of Rationalist Reconstruction of Ethics and Economics

De fact say positivism quickly dey refuted as a self-contradictory philosophical system naturally nor *help* e cause. Howeva, due to de self-serving nature of de positivist doctrine for dose wey dey positions of governmental power e also nor do much to reduce positivism’s popularity. Much more bin dey needed to defeat positivism dan to prove am logically false: England take decades of social experimentation, of trying on  ever-increasing scale to prove world-wide and within each nation state say  no ethical and economic laws dey, say notin na taboo, and say everytin dey possible. E take dd economic stagnation of de Western welfare democracies wey start for de late 60’s and early 70’s; de enduring impoverishment of de Third World nations decades after dia decolonization; and de gradual, and since de late 80’s—after more dan 70 years of experimenting—de breathtakingly rapid economic collapse of de socialist East Bloc countries.[^24] Outside of de real world, for academia, dat is, e take de temporary disappearance of ethics and political theory, and dia substitution by linguistic analysis, operationally meaningless moonshine talk, or interest group politics and bargaining theories.[^25] E require de degeneration of economics into either empirically meaningless symbolic exercises, wey nor get resemblance whatsoeva to wetin done once be de subject matter of de classics of economic thought (except for some occasional, economically sounding term[^26] produced by, at best, second-rate mathematicians for no actual audience at all, but only to dey collect dust for de tax-supported libraries of dis world); or e require e degeneration into  mighty econometric forecasting industry, wey e  futility dey painfully obvious to everybody , including de politicians and government bureaucrats who subsidized am so as to employ am for purposes of “scientific legitimation.”[^27] E require dd default of de Keynesian system, wit de advent of dd allegedly impossible phenomenon of stagflation for de mid-70’s; de breakdown of de monetarist paradigm, after a long series of patently false predictions from de late 70’s on through de 80’s; and de complete, worldwide bankruptcy of Marxist economics.[^28]

Still positivism neva die. Howeva, since de mid-70’s de price of decades of social relativism and engineering don dey too high to be ignored or simply explained away. Gradually, one philosophical crisis situation don emerge. E nor dey surprising say, wit positivism finally losing ground oda varieties of relativism, wey don dey submerged during de positivist reign, don resurface and dey try fill de widening ideological vacuum. Associated with names such as hermeneutics, rhetoric, ultra-subjectivism, and deconstructionism, an academic movement of sorts is underway that is trying to revive the old message of nihilism—that there is no such thing as truth—and which ascribes the failure of positivism not to its relativism, but to the fact that it is not relativistic enough in continuing to allow for *empirical* (hypothetical) truths rather than for no truths at all.[^29]

[^29]: For a critical evaluation of de new nihilism see Henry Veatch, “Deconstruction in Philosophy: Has Rorty Made It the Denouement of Contemporary Analytical Philosophy?,” *Review of Metaphysics* 39 (1985); Jonathan Barnes, “A Kind of Integrity,” *London Review of Books* (November 6, 1986); Rothbard, “The Hermeneutical Invasion of Philosophy and Economics”; Hoppe, “In Defense of Extreme Rationalism.”

But de crisis don also bring back de philosophy of social rationalism wey don for long demonstrate de falsity of positivism but fall enter  oblivion during de decades of positivist supremacy. Sparked by de Nobel-prize award in 1974 to Friedrich August von Hayek, de arch-rationalist Austrian School of economics, for de tradition of Carl Menger, Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk and, above all, Ludwig von Mises, Hayek’s teacher, and Murray N. Rothbard, don experience  resounding revival. Wey dem remove for decades from de higher reaches of subsidized academia because of e unpalatable implications for dose wey dey power and relegated to an unobtrusive existence for de underworld of non-University, real-world intellectuals, de Austrian School don steadily gain momentum and don grow into a genuine mass movement, with an increasing number of academic bastions as well as a continuously swelling grass roots support. In fact, spearheaded by de Ludwig von Mises Institute, founded in de mid-80’s, de movement don take international dimension with a rapidly spreading Mises-renaissance among intellectual circles for de countries of Eastern Europe. Faced with de total collapse of socialism and de exhaustion of all governmental authority and legitimacy, and confronted wit de task of de immediate and radical reconstruction of dia countries, de advice wey empirically meaningless mathematical economics, or econometrics, fit give or wey go fit dey derived from Keynesianism, Monetarism, Rational Expectationism or, worse still, Hermeneuticism, go fit only appear to dem as ridiculously inappropriate. For dia emergency situation, na only de Austrian School dey offer  unambiguous, radical, and constructive answer: Nor be only say truths dey exist for de social sciences, but dere dey exist a priori, nonhypothetical truths wey nobody fit undo. The truth dey as simple as fundamental: sat private property and private property rights na  indisputably valid, absolute principle of ethics and de basis for continuous “optimal” economic progress; and dat in order to arise from de ruins of socialism, notin go suffice but an uncompromising privatization of each and all property and de return to a contractual society based on de recognition of de absoluteness of private property rights.[^30]

[^30]: For a critical assessment of de revolution in Eastern Europe see Hans-Hermann Hoppe, “The Collapse of Socialism and the Future of Eastern Europe,” *Kwasny Economics* II, no. 6 (October 30, 1989); idem, *Desocialization in a United Germany* (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1991).

Truly, de Austrian School dey represent demost ambitious of all forms of social rationalism with e unyielding contention say nonhypothetical a priori empirical knowledge within the field of de social sciences dey exists, and dat na ethics and economics (wey contain dis knowledge) wey dey analogous to logic and protophysics as de absolutely indispensable foundation of all empirical social research. Further even, de Austrian School alone don substantiate dis contention by offering  completely developed, consistent, and all-comprehensive *positive* theory of ethics and economics.[^31]

[^31]: See in particular Mises, *Human Action*; Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*; idem, *The Ethics of Liberty* (Atlantic Highlands: Humanities Press, 1982).

Indirectly, de basic claim of Austrianism don already dey established. During de above refutation of positivism e dey demonstrated say while knowledge and actions nor fit dey conceived of as caused (i.e., predictable on de basis of time-invariantly operating effect variables), any action, by virtue of say you dey try  bring about some given goal, presupposes  causally structured physical reality. E clear say , dis insight itself represents a perfect example of de possibility of nonhypothetical social knowledge: e formulates knowledge about actions wey no actor fit possibly discover to dey false, bcos any such discovery go actually presuppose e validity. Austrianism in fact merely dey claim say much more dey implied for we own reflectively gained knowledge of wetin dey to act dan dus, which no actor fit as e be possibly falsify.

De Austrian theory set out from two systematically interrelated axioms, both of which dey nonhypothetically true. De first na de “axiom of action”: de proposition say humans act, or more precisely, say I dey act now. E nor fit dey denied say dis proposition na truth, since de denial go eself be action. Even self nobody fit intentionally *not* act, bcos dis, too, go be action. As e be so detruth of de axiom literally nor fit dey undone.[^32]

[^32]: See Mises, *Human Action*, part 1.

De second axiom na de “a priori of argumentation”. Wetin we don do here all along—as I dey write dis study and de reader dey read am—dey engage in argumentation. If nor be for argumentation, debate for nor dey about de truth or falsity of social relativism or rationalism and de status of ethics and economics. Na only silence or meaningless noise for dey. Na only wit argumentation nai de idea of validity and truth dey emerge. Whetha or not something na true, false, or undecidable; whetha or not e don dey justified; wetin dey required in order to justify am; whetha me, somebody else, or no one dey right—all of dis gats dey decided for de course of argumentation and propositional exchanges. Dis proposition na a priori true, too, bcos e nor fit dey denied witout affirming am in de act of denying it. Person no fit argue say person nor fit argue, and person nor fit dispute knowing wetin e mean to raise a validity claim witout implicitly claiming at least de negation of dis proposition to dey true. Dis na de *a priori of argumentation*,[^33] and both axioms eh related as logically necessary interwoven strands of a priori knowledge. For one hand, actions dey more fundamental dan argumentation bcos argumentation na only a subclass of action. On de oda hand, to state wetin just dey stated about action a argumentation and dia relationship to each oda already require argumentation, so epistemologically argumentation gats dey considered to dey more fundamental dan nonargumentative action.

[^33]: Check in particular Apel, *Transformation der Philosophie*, vol II.

Ethics, or more specifically, de Austrian private property ethic, dey derived from de a priori of argumentation, and na from its nature as a nonhypothetically true axiom that ethics derives its own status as absolutely true.[^34]

[^34]: See on the following Hoppe, *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism*, chaps. 2, 7.

Wit de a priori of argumentation established as an axiomatic starting point of epistemology, e follow say anytin wey go dey presupposed for de act of proposition-making nor fit dey propositionally disputed again. E go dey meaningless to ask for  justification of presuppositions wey go make de production of meaningful propositions possible in de first place. Instead, dey gats dey regarded as ultimately justified by every proposition maker. Any specific propositional content wey dispute dia validity must dey understood as implying a performative or practical contradiction.

Further, in de same way as e dey undeniably true say person nor fit argue say person nor fit argue, and say e gats dey assume say  everybody wey dey engaged for argumentation gats know wetin e mean to claim sometin to be true, e also dey true say any argument go require an arguing person, an actor. Arguing nor dey just consist of free-floating propositions but na always activity, too. Given say truth claims gats dey raised and decided upon for de course of argumentation, and say argumentation, aside from wateva dem talk for e course na also practical affair, e follow say intersubjectively meaningful norms gat to exist. Dese norms dey precisely dose wey make an action argumentation, and dem get special cognitive status in dat dem be de practical preconditions of truth. In fact, neitha de empiricalfact/emotive-value dichotomy so dear to de positivists, nor dia distinction between empirical and analytical statements, fit dey  claimed to dey valid unless de norms underlying argumentation (for de course of wey dese distinctions dey made) dey demselves regarded as valid. E dey simply impossible to argue odawise bcos in doing so person go in fact presuppose dia validity.

Now, as a necessarily practical affair, any propositional exchange dey require a proposition-maker’s exclusive control (property) over some scarce means. Nobody fit possibly propose anytin, and nobody fit possibly become convinced of any proposition, if person right to make exclusive use of e physical body nor already dey presupposed. Na person recognition of anoda person mutually exclusive control over e body wey explain de distinctive characteristic of propositional exchanges: say while person fit disagree about wetin dem don talk, e still dey possible to agree at least for de fact say disagreement dey. E dey obvious, too, say dat kind  property right for person own body dem gat to talk am say e dey justified a priori, for anybody wey go try to justify any norm whatsoeva gats already presuppose exclusive right of control over e body simply to say, “I propose such and such.” Anybody wey dey dispute dat kind right go dey caught up for practical contradiction, since in arguing so person go already implicitly don accept de very norm say person dey dispute.

Last last, e go dey equally impossible to engage in argumentation, if man nor dey allowed to appropriate in addition to man body oda scarce means thru homesteading, i.e., by putting dem to use before someone else does, or if such means nor dey defined for objective, physical terms.

For if nobody get de right to control anytin at all, except e own body, den we go all cease to exist and de problem of justifying norms—as well as all oda human problems—simply nor go exist. De fact say person dey alive presupposes dd validity of property rights to oda things. Nobody wey dey alive fit argue odawise.

And if person nor acquire de right of exclusive control over such goods by homesteading, by establishing some objective link between a particular person and a particular physical resource before anybody else done am, but instead late-comers come dey assumed to get ownership claims to tins, then literally *nobody go dey allowed to do anytin wit anytin at any time* unless he get de prior consent of all late-comers. Neither we nor our forefathers nor our progeny fit survive or go survive if we dey allowed to follow dis rule. Yet in order for any person—past, present or future—to argue anytin e must clearly dey possible to survive. And in order make we fit do am, property rights nor fit dey conceived of as timeless and nonspecific regarding de number of people concerned. Rather, property rights gats necessarily originate thru action at definite places and times for specific acting individuals. Odawise, e go dey impossible for anybody to say anytin at a definite tine and place and for someone else to reply. To assert say de first-user-first-owner rule of private property fit dey ignored or dey unjustified implies a contradiction. Person assertion of dis proposition presuppose person existence as a physically independent decision-making unit at a given point in time, and de validity of de homesteading principle as an absolute principle of property acquisition.

Economics, or for Mises’s terminology praxeology, and e level as a nonhypothetical, a priori true social science dey derived from the axiom of action.[^35]

[^35]: Check for de following Mises, *Human Action*, chap. IV; Rothbard, *Man Economy, and State*, chap. 1; idem, “Praxeology: The Methodology of Austrian Economics,” in Edwin Dolan, ed., *The Foundations of Modern Austrian Economics* (Kansas City: Sheed and Ward, 1976); Hoppe, *Praxeology and Economic Science*; also Lionel Robbins, *The Nature and Significance of Economic Science* (New York: New York University Press, 1982).

Wit every action an actor dey pursue a goal, and whateva e goal fit be, de fact say e dey pursued by an actor reveals say e dey place a relatively higher value on am dan on any oda goal of action he fit conceive of at de start of e action.

In order to achieve dis goal an actor gat to interfere or decide not to interfere (wey be also interference) at an earlier point in time to produce a later result, and dis interference dey imply de use of some scarce means (at least dose of de actor body, e standing room, and de time used by de interference).

Dis means also needs to get value for an actor—a value wey dey derived from dat of de goal—bcos de actor must regard dia employment as necessary in order to achieve de goal effectively. Further, actions fit only dey performed sequentially and dey always involve making a choice, i.e., taking up one course of action wey at some given point in time dey promise de most highly valued result to de actor and excluding at de same time de pursuit of oda, less valued goals.

In addition, wen acting an actor nor dey only invariably aim to substitute a more for a less satisfactory state of affairs and demonstrate a preference for higher over lower values; he dey also invariably consider wen for de future e goals go deyreached and demonstrate a universal preference for earlier over later results. Since every action dey requires time and man gat ti occasionally consume sometin, time always dey scarce. Hence, present or earlier results dey, and invariably gats dey, valued more highly dan future or later ones, and man go only exchange  present value against a future one if he for de process anticipate *increasing* e future well-being.

Furthermore, as a consequence of having to choose and give preference to one goal over anoda, of not being able to realize all goals simultaneously, and of being constrained by time preference, each and every action dey imply de incurrence of costs, i.e., dd forsaking of de value attached to de most highly valued alternative goal wey nor fit dey realized or wey e realization gats dey postponed bcos de means necessary to effect am dey bound up for de production of anoda, even more highly valued goal.

Finally, e dey implied for our knowledge of wetin e be to act, dat for e starting point every goal of action gats dey considered worth more to de actor dan e cost and capable of yielding a profit, i.e., a result wey e value dey ranked higher dan dat of de foregone opportunities. Howeva, every action also dey invariably threatened by de possibility of a loss if in retrospect an actor find out say contrary to expectations de result actually achieved get lower value dan de relinquished alternative for get.

All of dese categories wey we know to be de very heart of economics—values, means, choice, preference, time preference, cost, profit and loss—dey implied for de axiom of action. Like de axiom itself, dem dey incorporate nonhypothetically true knowledge. Any attempt to disprove dis knowledge go itself gat to be action, aimed at a goal, requiring means, excluding oda courses of action, incurring costs, subjecting dd actor to de possibility of achieving or not achieving de desired goal, and so leading to a profit or a loss.

All true economic propositions, and dis na wetin de Austrian conception of economics dey all about, fit dey deduced by means of formal logic from dis incontestably true material knowledge regarding de meaning of action and e categories. More precisely, all true economic theorems dey consist of: (a) an understanding of de meaning of action; (b) a situation or situational change—assumed to dey given or identified as being given—and described in terms of action-categories; and (c) a logical deduction of de consequences—again in terms of data kind categories—wey result for an actor from dis situation or situational change. For instance, de law of marginal utility, one of de most basic laws of economics, follows from our indisputable knowledge of de fact say every actor dey always prefer wetin go satisfy am more over wetin go  satisfy am less, plus de assumption say he dey faced wit an increase for de supply of a good (a scarce means) wey de units he dey regard as of equal serviceability by one additional unit. From dis e follow wit logical necessity say dis additional unit fit only dey employed as a means for de removal of an uneasiness wey dey  deemed less urgent dan de least valuable goal previously satisfied by a unit of such a good.

De combination of ethics as e dey implied for de axiom of argumentation and of economics as implied for dat of action yields wetin fit dey called Austrian welfare economics.[^36

[^36]: Also check Murray N. Rothbard, *Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics* (New York: Center for Libertarian Studies, Occasional Paper Series no. 3, 1977); idem, *Power and Market* (Kansas City: Sheed, Andrews and McMeel, 1977); idem, “The Myth of Neutral Taxation,” *Cato Journal* 1, no. 2 (1981); Hoppe, *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism*; idem, “*Man, Economy, and Liberty*: Review Essay,” *Review of Austrian Economics* 4 (1990).

If and insofar as actors dey choose to act in accordance wit de indisputably valid principle of de private property ethic, social welfare—defined for de terms of Pareto-optimality—go invariably dey optimized:  Person original appropriation of unowned resources, as demonstrated by dis very action, go increase e utility or welfare (at least *ex ante*). At de same time, e dey make nobody worse off bcos in appropriating dem he nor dey take anytin away from odas. Clearly, odas for fit homestead resources, too, if only dem be don perceived as scarce, and hence, valuable. Howeva, dem no do like dat did, wey demonstrate say dem no attach value to dem at all, and so dem nor fit talk say dem don lose any utility on account of this act. Proceeding from dis basis, any further act of production utilizing homesteaded resources dey equally Pareto-optimal on demonstrated preference grounds, provided only say e nor deyuninvitedly impair de physical integrity of de resources wey dey homesteaded or produced wit homesteaded means by odas. Last, every voluntary exchange starting from dis basis must also dey regarded as a Paretooptimal change because it fit only take place if both parties expect to benefit from am.

Operating according to de rules wey I just described always, and invariably so, go lead to de greatest possible production of wealth, for any deviation from dis set of rules implies, by definition, a redistribution of property titles, and hence of income, away from user-producers and contractors of goods onto non-users-producers and noncontractors. Consequently, any such deviation implies say dem go be relatively less original appropriation of resources wey dia  scarcity dey recognized, dem go be less production of new goods, less maintenance of existing goods, and less mutually beneficial contracting and trading. Dis in turn go implh a lower standard of living in terms of exchangeable goods and services. Furthermore, de provision say only de *first* user of a good acquires ownership assures say productive efforts go dey as high as possible *at all times*. De provision say only de physical integrity of property (nor be property values) dey protected guarantees say every owner go undertake de greatest possible *value*-productive efforts to promote favorable changes for property values and to prevent or counter any unfavorable changes for property values (as dem fit result from anoda person action regarding e property). So, any deviation from dese rules also imply reduced levels of value productive efforts at all times.

De radical simplicity of dis Austrian theory of ethics and economics, indeed de fact say e don dey fully elaborated—foremost in Ludwig von Mises’s epochal *Human Action*, and in Murray N. Rothbard’s *Man, Economy, and State* and *The Ethics of Liberty*—to a rigorously consistent as well as architectonically beautiful edifice of ethical and economic thought don explain why de social rationalism of de Austrian School fit dey driven underground during de heyday of positivism but neva fit dey entirely uprooted and eradicated. E truth dey too obvious for am to dey consistently ignored among men of intellectual curiosity and common sense, for e nor dey natural say every person gats own e own body as well as all scarce goods wey e dey put to use with de help of dis body before anyone else do am? E nor dey obvious say every owner suppose get de right to employ dese goods as he dey see fit so long as in so doing he nor dey uninvitedly change de physical integrity of anoda personproperty? E nor dey obvious say once a good don first dey homesteaded or produced wit homesteaded means, den ownership of am fit only dey acquired by means of a contractual, voluntary transfer of a property title from a previous to a later owner? And e nor dey intuitively clear say na only if, and insofar as, dese rules dey in effect, de greatest possible production of social wealth and welfare go ensue?[^37]

[^37]: See for de idea of a natural sense of justice also Gustave de Molinari, *The Production of Security* (Burlingame, Calif.: Center for Libertarian Studies, Occasional Paper Series No. 2, 1977).

Dis theory wey dey obviously true get de most radical practical-political implications. E dey refutes as ethically unjustifiable and economically counterproductive actions such as taxation, de legislative redistribution of private property rights, de creation of fiat money, fractional reserve banking, and ultimately, de very institution of state government. E dey demand instead a pure private property society, an anarchy of private property owners, regulated exclusively by private property law.[^38] For dis reason, de Austrian School don dey put for fundamental opposition to any exercise of governmental power. Recognizing iam as dka natural and most dangerous intellectual enemy, dose wey dey power don do everything possible to stamp out e memory and substitute statolatry for ethics and economics. As Mises don write:

[^38]: For dis also Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*; idem, *Power and Market*, idem, *For A New Liberty*; idem, *The Ethics of Liberty*; Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *Eigentum, Anarchie, und Staat* (Opladen: Westdeutscher Verlag, 1987); idem, *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism*.

> Despots and democratic majorities dey drunk wit power. Dem gats  reluctantly admit say dem dey subject to de laws of nature. But dem dey reject dd very notion of economic law. Nor be dem be de supreme legislator? ...E dey impossible to understand de history of economic thought if person nor dey pay attention to de fact say economics as such na  challenge to de conceit of dose wey dey power. An economist  go neva be a favorite of autocrats and demagogues. Wit dem he na always de mischief-maker, and de more dem dey inwardly convinced say e objections dey well founded, de more dem go hate am.[^39]

[^39]: Mises, *Human Action*, p. 67.

For de present situation of a worldwide crisis of governmental legitimacy, of de collapse of East Bloc Socialism, and of de enduring stagnation of de Western Welfare States, de chance for Austrian rationalism to fill de philosophical vacuum wey don appear with de retreat of positivism and to become de paradigm of de future dey as good or beta dan eva.[^40] Now like before e require moral courage as much as intellectual integrity to propound de Austrian social theory—de opposing statist battalions still dey represent a formidable majority and dem dey in control of a far larger share of resources. No shaking sha, wit dd total breakdown of socialism and de concept of social ownership wey dey look everybody for face, de antithetical Austrian theory of private property, free markets and laissez faire nor fit but gain attractiveness and win support. Austrians get reason to believe say de time don come wen dem fit succeed in bringing about a fundamental change in public opinion, by reclaiming ethics and economics from de hands of de positivists and de engineering powerful and by restoring public recognition of private property rights and free markets based on such rights as ultimate, absolute principles of ethics and economics.
