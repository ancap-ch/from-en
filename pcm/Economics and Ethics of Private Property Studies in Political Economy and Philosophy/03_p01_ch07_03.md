### De matter wey concern Fraud: Reserve Banking wey dey fractional and de Freedom wey dey inside Contract

De classification wey Murray Rothbard do wey call fractional reserve banking as fake something na de answer wey e get for one long research wey im do wey concern ethics and property-rights theory. Selgin and White talk am correctly say economics no need too much brain and e dey different from ethics. Person fit study am without say e never first learn anything wey be concern property and property-rights theory. Even like dat sef, dem nor been dey waste time to talk some kind ethical statements wey get power well well. If dem wan do like say dem dey good if dem dey defend fractional reserve banking, Selgin and White dey hardly talk of property, talkless to come dey list de theory wey concern  property. Dis one com bring about plenty serious mistake and wahala: confusion com dey dey if dem wan differentiate between property and titles wey property get; wahala wey concern  weda e dey possible or not make one thing (property) get owner wey pass one for de same time; wahala wey concern priority of property wey dey logical and theory wey concern property if dem put am side by side with contract and de theory wey concern contract; and wahala wey still concern if e dey necessary make somebody fulfill everything wey e suppose do  wey dey inside de contract with person property (and e no go be just anybody).

De wahala go come enter wetin de author dey talk for de issue wey concern “freedom of contract”. De tin wey dem dey argue sef just dey straightforward.

> If bank nor put mouth or nor join for de matter wey na to hold reserve 100 percent, den fractional reserve nor go against de agreement wey dey inside de contract between bank and de customers wey dey follow de bank do business. …  If we comot am for law de arrangement wey dey inside contract wey dem no force person to permit reserve-holding go be like wetin person put hand for inside de market, den freedom wey contract get go com get limits and dat freedom na part wey dey very important for private property rights.[^14]

Dis passage go come show us again de ultra-subjectivism wey Selgin and White don first talk before. For wetin this view come talk, na agreement wey dem no dey put force naim dey actually -dey talk- wetin contract wey dey valid be. If we look am dat way, contract wey dey valid na agreement wey concern to dey transfer real property; derefor, de selection of contracts wey dey valid dey always dey first meet problem wey concern de nature of things and property(and later, e go come be only agreement). Na because of dis thing Hoppe (p. 70) com explain am well say

> Freedom of contract nor mean say *all* de contract wey go dey of advantage to me and you, make dem allow am…. Wetin freedom of contract mean be say make dem dey allow A and B to dey make any contract  at all *wey concern property wey na dem get*, but fractional reserve banking go need may dem dey make contracts wey concern properties wey third parties get.[^15]

Selgin and White com talk say dis tin wey dem talk, e nor correct  and dem come call am “third- party effects” and dem come challenge wetin Hoppe talk with confusion wey strong well well wey concern the nature wey property and property rights get. Wetin dem first talk come be

> wetin remain for other actions and de *quality* of property wey dey under C… na somtin wey dem nor fit escape for free-market and nor be say e dey go against the private-property rights wey C get,[and for another way] *say dem use force tey enter* C property… and e clear say e nor follow wetin the right wey dey protect C property talk. E suppose dey clear say if dem tell A and B may dem do any transaction wey even get small effect for de *market value* of wetin C get, without any power wey dem dey show or threat wey nor go favour C or de property wey C get, then de law wey dem tey choose private property, freedom wey suppose dey inside contract and completion wey go get free-market go come comot patapata. Dem nor suppose to allow B make e tell A say e wan sell compact disc recording, because say if e sell am, e go come reduce de value wey de place wey dem dey record  vinyl wey be C own?[^16]

De second one, dem com talk say if you reduce de power wey money get to tey buy something, wey dem agree say go occur for every matter wey concern fiduciary media, say de value-effect nor go get harm and derefor “e nor go provide any reason wey dem go tey stop de action wey bank wan take for court”. Derefore dem come reach conclusion wey be say dem talk say Hoppe argument “nor dey valid” (and dem nor fit join am with the theory wey Rothbard talk wey concern property).

De argument wey Selgie and White bin dey argue com get two mistake. De first one be say, de main tin wey dem first talk bin correct, na lie say Hoppe dey mistake for wetin dem talk. Hoppe don write well well for de theory wey concern property rights, and e nor dey aware for only de tin wey com stand out wey Selgin and White talk but e com even bring defense wey dey practical for wetin dem talk; derefore for dis matter, difference nor dey for de judgement wey Rothbard and Hoppe talk.[^17]

For De second one, de small tin wey dem be talk before na lie (and even wetin dem conclude too go be lie). Selgin and White talk say if de power to tey buy com fall because of fiduciary media na de same tin as say price of anything wey don fall and wey nor dey coz harm (wey change of supply and demand coz). Say people wey get money dey lose power to tey buy na because of de reserve banking wey dey fractional, as dem dey claim, e nor different for all dose people wey get potato or car dey suffer for value loss because of say de supply many or people wey dey need am com reduce for potato and motor.

For dis place again, Selgin and White com dey bring money (gold) together – na im be property, and all dose things wey fit replace money (banknotes) – na im be property titles. To dey sure, de matter wey concern fiduciary media nor dey lead to damage wey we fit see for physical property. After all, banknote na just piece of paper, and paper nor dey get effect for de outside world. But we fit talk de same thing for de mata wey concern fiduciary titles wey affect potato and motor. All dose one too na just pieces of paper, and e nor get effect for real world. Even tho, e still get one difference wey dey important wey dey between changes for de position of money wey who get potato and motor get wey change for demand and to dey supply for titles wey quantities wey nor dey exist ( e nor dey change) of motor and potato get for de other hand. Na sure thing be say people wey get potato and motor go dey affected for de two case. For the first case, if de money for potato or motor com fall because people wey dey buy de potato and motor com get supply wey com too many, everybody wey still get potato and motor go still get de same (e nor go change) amount of wetin im get (motor and potato) wey dey e hand. None of wetin dem get go reduce. Na de same tin if de price com fall because say people wey dey buy de potato or motor dey willing to only bring out small amount of de other  things wey dem get to tey exchange for de motor and potato, dis one by eself nor get any effect for de quantity of potato wey who get potato com get or de quantity of motor wey who dey sell motor get. If we wan differentiate wetin we talk for de second case, to dey give and sell another title to de quantity of potato and motor wey nor change *go* com cause make de quantity of potato and motor wey dere owners get to come less. E nor just get any value-effect; de power to tey buy wey potato or motor title get go come fall. E nor get any physical effect: de person wey dey issue am and de seller of fudiciary potato or motor titles go com dey use other people potato and motor anyhow. He go come dey give out other people property and e nor go gree release e own (to tey exchange for property title wey dey empty).[^18]

### De mata wey concern Fraud III: De “Proof wey com out for Existence” Reserve Banking wey dey Fractional and State

E nor get anyone for inside de title-transfer theory or de principle wey concern freedom of contract dey support de claim say de issue wey still concern fiduciary media and reserve banking wey dey fractional wey dem go accept. For de opposite, only one argument com remain wey dey support wetin dem talk say fractional reserve banking na one kind business wey nor be bad business.

De argument com long sotay e com reach de proof wey concern existence: X,Y or Z dey exist; e nor go dey if e nor dey benefit person; derefor, e sopoz dey (and to remove am go dey bad and e nor go dey right morally).

So, Selgin and White com talk say:

> all de plenty [people] wey dere freedom of contract concern us for here nor be small set of people wey just dey for center, but na plenty people wey don show say dem like bank wey dey use fractional reserve tey dey work… people wey dey deposit money com still dey follow all dis bank, and dis one com show say na dat one dem prefer.[^19]
> 
> … If we wan follow de principle wey all dose depositors don show us, e go mean say all dose people wey dey deposit money dey gain from wetin dem dey offer and dem don even gree say dem go accept de risk and everything wey dey follow am.[^20]
> 
> \[The result wey follow,\] \[if\] *any* body by eself  com choose to dey put money inside  (wetin carry interest) fractional-reserve account, instead of inside (storage-fee-charging) 100 percent account wey dey reserve, den one kind barrier wey clear well well for fractional-banking banking go use de force wey law give am go com be legal restriction wey get power well well for de freedom of contact for inside market wey concern services wey dey for bank.[^21]
> 
> [Moreover,]… all dose plenty things wey dose wey dey deposit something for bank and dose wey get note go get, wey go get interest and services wey de extra bank revenue wey dem don gather don already pay for  wey dem tey borrow one small part of e liability. Benefit wey people wey borrow from bank go enjoy plenty intermediate credit wey bank go give dem, and everybody wey dey work follow de economy go come get capital equipment wey big  well well. And benefits must to dey gada for  people wey get shares for inside bank, wey go fit choose make de bank no give dem demand liabilities if dem come see say dem nor go fit carry de risk wey follow am.[^22]

Selgin and White for dis mata don already put cart for front of horse. If say dem dey practice somtin, even tho say e don spread, nor go get where e dey if dem dey ask de question wey be say weda e dey justifiable or not. Make we first look, for de purpose wey dem go tey illustrate am, the explanation wey follow wey concern whether de permission wey state get dey right abi e dey wrong, for inside one law and order wey concern territory (or wey concern justice and to dey protect).[^23]

For wetin Selgin and White talk (wey we go put for here, tho for another way wey no be de same thing), de people wey dey together wey na dere freedom of contract concern us no just be small people, but na plenty people wey don show say dem like states (judges and people wey dey protect person)wey dey operate well well for one basis. People wey dey stay for inside de territory com continue to dey follow all dese state to show say na dem de people like pass. So because of dis thing wey dem don show, dem com assume say all dese people wey dey stay for inside dis territory dey gain for wetin dem dey offer and dem don agree to carry both de risk and everything wey follow am. So if anybody come by eself come prefer to dey put e money inside state account wey carry tax instead of protection fee-charging account for justice and protection agencies wey nor dey collect tax, den one big law wey go stop state-formation if dem put power wey law carry, e go come be legal restriction wey dey binding for de freedom wey contract get for market wey concern justice and protection services. If at all, benefits wey dem don gada for people wey dey deposit for state and dose wey get note, wey dey collect interest and services wey dem don already pay for by de extra revenue wey dey enter state hand wey dem get wen dem bring together all de deposit for tax wey dem dey collect wey dey extra. Benefits wey people wey dey borrow from state wey dey enjoy plenty supply of intermediate credit, and to all de people wey dey work follow de economy go come get capital equipment wey big  well well.

If dem dey give dere own libertarian credentials, Selgin and Whitte go sopoz reject dis kind talk say na lie and e nor dey appropriate. But if na so, den why? Wetin cuz am make e be say na de second *proof*nor correct and nor be de first one? Wat if say na anything go make de big law wey dey stop (or go permit) fractional reserve banking go dey different from big law wey nor allow (or e allow) de operation and formation wey state dey use?

De answer- say e nor get any difference like dat wey dey exist and de two proof nor correct – dem go see am for de principle wey demonstrate preference wey Rothbardian do. While Selgin and White come carry dis principle, com use am support dere own conclusion wey concern ethical permissibility of reserve banking wey dey fractional, dem com miss de implication. De principle wey concern preference wey dem demonstrate, as Rothbard tey explain am for dat “Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics”, wey dem celebrate well well  com dey *presuppose* right wey property get. No be all preference wey dey demonstrate ethics go permit or go benefit people socially. Instead, de only preference wey dem permit and wey go enhance welfare na all dese ones wey dem dey express by all de property wey person get and no other thing dan e own property. All de preference wey dem dey demonstrate by property wey nor be your own – wey be oda people own – dem nor go permit am and e nor go dey beneficial.

As de people wey like state pass don demonstrate am, e nor com follow with wetin Rothbard talk. For wetin Rothbard talk, wey som people dey accept especially dose people wey dey de two side of dis debate, dem go fit point quick quick wetin nor follow. Private property, na wetin dey come out from de (original) appropriation and/or production, wey mean say de right wey owner get to better space wey concern e property, including de right wey e get to tey carry all dis property if e wan defend am if anybody wey no sopoz enter am com use force enter am. Really, e nor get property wey go dey wey de owner nor go get right to defend eself physically, and na dis one be de main purpose wey private property get to tey establish domains wey dey separate for jurisdiction wey go dey different. E nor get private-property owner wey go gree surrender e right to de ultimate jurisdiction over and d defense wey e go fit give e property to another person – unless say e sell am or e com transfer de property (and for dat kind case, na another person go com get de power over am). Na im be say, as far as say something (good) dem never abandon am, e owner n aim go get all dese right; and as far say e still concern others, everybody wey get property go only partake for de better thing wey go come out if dem divide de labor and e go come dey find better protection for e property right wey dem nor fit change if e dey cooperate with oda people wey still get property. Everybody wey get property go fit buy from, go  fit sell give, or say dem go fit contact with every oda person for wetin concern property protection and security services wey dey extra.Yet anybody wey get property go fit at anytime fit stop to dey cooperate with other people. For wetin dey different, monopoly wey concern protection and jurisdiction wey dey territorial – a state – go mean say everybody wey get property, dem nor go allow dem make e nor continue to dey cooperate with person wey dey protect am, and e nor go get anybody (except monopolist) wey go fit use all de jurisdiction on top property wey im get. Instead everybody apart from dat monopolist nor go get right to defense, as e com be, de person go com dey defenseless by person wey first dey protect am. E com clear say all dose kind institution go com dey against all de preference wey all de owners don dey demonstrate wey dem nor fit give up de property wey dem get. De one wey nor support all dis dere preference wey dem dey demonstrate, de monopolist nor go allow de people mey dem use dere property too tey defend against people wey dem wan use force tey enter am by imself and people wey dey follow  am. Monopoly wey go com concern protection and jurisdiction go com rest from de outset for act of expropriation (taxation) wey dem nor permit and e go com provide monopolist and people wey dey follow am with power to tey dey expropriate and dey tax well well. Every owner limit of action wey dem fit permit wey concern e own property and the value wey dey de property too go come reduce whereas wetin de monopolist fit do and power wey e get go come big well well and d privilege wey only him get go com dey show for de value of e property wey go come increase (capitalization of profit wey concern monopoly).

For dis days ehn, states full for everywhere, and nearly everybody dey stay for under de *protection* wey na state give. Make we comot eye for dis demonstration wey dem dey do wey concern preference, however, e nor get anything wey dey bad if we look am for both ethically and even economically, wit protection wey big well well against formation wey state do. Nobody go fit form state, and na de same reason why nobody go fit expropriate or thief from anoda person. For law court ehn, e go dey enough say one person wey get property no gree mey monopoly dey exist, and de monopolist go com stop wetin e dey do wey be tax-yielding protection agency and dem go com repair am mey e com get legal status of wetin no concern tax but e go be fee-charging law-and-security agency (firm wey dey normal and wey still dey specialized). Protection agency wey be tax-yielding no dey agree for terms –person wey dey use force dey protect-and dem must to dey forbid am, without say dem nor look de benefit wey e dey bring come give people wey dey deposit money with state, people wey dey borrow money from state, and people wey get state. If we wan do am like dat, e nor dey stop freedom of contract wey dey legal for market wey concern justice and protection services, but e go com be like de presupposition wey concern freedom of contract and justice. Everybody wey dey put money or any other thing wey be get value inside protection agency wey dey bring tax dey inside action wey nor dey lawful and dat person go receive punishment.

Just as state tey full everywhere, na so fractional reserve banks dey too, and for dese days ehn, e nor get anybody wey nor dey follow fractional reserve banks. Wetin be if at all e dey, wetin go be de difference between de status wey state get and de one wey fractional reserve bank get? Why dem nor go comot fractional reserve banks as dem tey comot protection agencies? If we wan dey sure, just as we nor dey argue wetin concern demand wey dem dey do for protection agency, na so we no sopoz to dey doubt too for matter wey concern as people tey dey demand for banking services. But instead, as dem dey ask for protection services weyy people wey get private property go show properly nor join de demand for protection agencies wey dey bring tax as we don see am. E just permit say dem go need protection agencies wey go dey charge fees. Why old way wey dem tey dey differentiate nor go also dey true for matter wey concern banking services. Why as de demand wey concern deposit accounts wey dey yield interest dem nor go allow am as dem tey dey demand for protection accounts? If we wan really look am say interest-yielding deposit accounts and tax-yielding property protection nor be de same thing for terms? Why de thing wey money warehouse and clearing institution (wey be 100-percent-reserve-deposit banking) go fit do as e dey inside credit (savings-and-loan banking) no go be only de banking forms wey good (e go just be like as dose fee charging agency na de only form of protection wey dey good)?
