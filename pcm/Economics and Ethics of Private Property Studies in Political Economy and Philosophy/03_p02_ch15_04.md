### The Consequence of Moral Error: Statism and the Destruction of Liberty and Property

All mistakes dey costly. Dis one dey more obvious with laws way concern nature. If person mistake go law of nature, dat person no go fit reach him goals. Anyhow, becos say na every body way fail to do am go follow carry d wahala for head, e get one strong universal desire way con dey for people to sabi and con fit correct person mistakes. Moral errors follow dey costly. Way no be like d formal case, d cost, al least no be must, say na each and every body way do d mistake go pay for am. In fact, e go be d only case wen d mistake involve person way belief say "everybody" e right to tax and right for ultimate decision making way concern d person and property of "everybody" else. Society way dem d members belief *dis* go dey doomed. D price way dem go pay for dis mistake na universal death and extinction (dem go disappear forever). Anyhow, matters way dey very different if d mistake way dey involved na d way be say dem dey belief say na only *one agency*-*way be d state*- get right to tax and right to make ultimate decision (instead of "everybody", if not, way dey correct, nobody). Society way dem members bin belief *dis*-as in, say different laws must dey way dem dey apply unequally for dem masters and dem serfs, dem taxers and dem d taxed, dem legislators and dem legislatees-*fit* dey exist and fit endure. Dem must pay for dis mistake too. But no be everybody way get dis erroneous belief pay for am equally. Instead, *some* people go gats to pay for am, while dem odas-dem agents of d state-go actually benefit from d same error. Hence, for dis case, e go be error to assume say universal desire to learn and to correct person errors. Way dey contrary, for dis case, e must dey assumed say instead of say dem sabi and preach truth some people get continuous aim to lie, mean say, dem go preach lies even if dey demselves sabi say na lies.

In any case, what are the “mixed” consequences of, and what is the unequal price to be paid for, the error and/or lie of believing in the justice of the institution of a state?

Once the principle of government—judicial monopoly and the power to tax—is incorrectly admitted as just, any notion of restraining government power and safeguarding individual liberty and property is illusory. Instead, under monopolistic auspices the price of justice and protection will continually rise and the quality of justice and protection fall. A tax-funded protection agency is a contradiction in terms—an expropriating property protector—and will inevitably lead to more taxes and less protection. Even if, as some classical liberal statists have proposed, a government limited its activities exclusively to the protection of pre-existing private property rights, the further question of *how much* security to produce would arise. Motivated (like everyone) by self-interest and the disutility of labor but endowed with the unique power to tax, a government agent’s response will invariably be the same: To *maximize expenditures on protection*—and almost all of a nation’s wealth can conceivably be consumed by the cost of protection—and at the same time to *minimize the production of protection*. The more money one can spend and the less one must work to produce, the better off one will be.

Moreover, a judicial monopoly will inevitably lead to a steady deterioration in the quality of justice and protection. If no one can appeal to justice except to government, justice will be perverted in favor of the government, constitutions and supreme courts notwithstanding. Constitutions and supreme courts are state constitutions and agencies, and all limitations to state action they might contain or find are invariably decided by agents of the very institution under consideration. Predictably, the definition of property and protection will continually be altered and the range of jurisdiction expanded to the government’s advantage until, ultimately, the notion of universal and immutable human rights—and in particular property rights—will disappear and be replaced by that of law as government-made legislation and rights as government-given grants.

The results, all of which were predicted by Rothbard, are before our eyes, for everyone to see. The tax load imposed on property owners and producers has continually increased, making the economic burden even of slaves and serfs seem moderate in comparison. Government debt—and hence, future tax obligations—has risen to breathtaking heights. Every detail of private life, property, trade, and contract is regulated by ever higher mountains of paper laws. However, the only task that government was ever supposed to assume—of protecting our life and property—it does not perform. To the contrary, the higher the expenditures on social, public, and national security have risen, the more our private property rights have been eroded, the more our property has been expropriated, confiscated, destroyed, and depreciated. The more paper laws have been produced, the more legal uncertainty and moral hazard has been created, and lawlessness has displaced law and order. Instead of protecting us from domestic crime and foreign aggression, our government, equipped with enormous stockpiles of weapons of mass destruction, aggresses against ever new Hitlers and suspected Hitlerite sympathizers anywhere and everywhere outside of its “own” territory. In short, while we have become ever more helpless, impoverished, threatened, and insecure, our state rulers have become increasingly more corrupt, arrogant, and dangerously armed.
