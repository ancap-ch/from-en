### The Consequence of Moral Error: Statism and the Destruction of Liberty and Property

All errors are costly. This is most obvious with errors concerning laws of nature. If a person errs regarding laws of nature this person will not be able to reach his own goals. However, because the failure of doing so must be borne by each erring individual, there prevails in this realm a universal desire to learn and correct one’s errors. Moral errors are costly, too. Unlike in the former case, however, their cost must not, at least not necessarily, be paid for by each and every person committing the error. In fact, this would be the case only if the error involved were that of believing that *everyone* had the right to tax and the right of ultimate decision-making regarding the person and property of *everyone* else. A society whose members believed *this* would be doomed. The price to be paid for this error would be universal death and extinction. However, matters are distinctly different if the error involved is one of believing that only *one agency*—*the state*—has the right to tax and the right to ultimate decision-making (rather than *everyone*, or else, and correctly so, no one). A society whose members believed *this*—that is, that there must be different laws applying unequally to masters and serfs, taxers and taxed, legislators and legislatees—*can* in fact exist and endure. This error must be paid for, too. But not everyone holding this erroneous belief pays for it equally. Rather, *some* people will have to pay for it, while others—the agents of the state—actually benefit from the same error. Hence, in this case it would be mistaken to assume a universal desire to learn and correct one’s errors. To the contrary, in this case it must be assumed that rather than learning and promoting the truth, some people have a constant motive to lie, i.e., to maintain and promote falsehoods even if they themselves recognize them as such.

For any case, watin be dem d "mixed" consequences of, and watin be d unequal price way dem go pay for, d mistake and/or lie say dem belief for d justice of d institution of state?

Once dem don admit say d government principle of judicial monopoly and power to tax dey right, any notion say dem won reduce government power and say dem won safeguard person freedom and property dey fake. Instead, for where monopolistic sign don dey d price for justice and protection go dey rise, and d quality of justice and protection go dey fall. Agency way dem dey fund with tax money dey against d terms-one property protector way dey collect people property- and go everly result to more tax money and lesser protection. Even though, some liberal statists don propose, government way reduce him activities to dey only protect property rights way bin dey exist before, more question of say *how much* security way dem go produce go con come up. Way dey motivated (like everybody) by him own interest and way labour no dey make am happy but get special power on top tax, d response way government agent go give go everly be d same: Say to *increase money dem dey spend for protection*-and dem fit chop all d money way d country get on top protection-and d same time to *reduce protection way dem dey produce*. D more person fit spend, d less person gats pay to produce, e godl dey better for d person.

More say, judicial monopoly go everly cause small small spoil spoil for quality of justice and protection. If nobody fit go beg justice except to gk beg government, dem go corner justice to dey favour government, constitutions and dem supreme court no fit stop am. Constitutions and supreme court na state constitution and dem agency, and all limitations way dem go cause for state actions way we fit find must everly dey decided by dem d agents way we dey  talk about. Like we fit predict, dem go dey always change d definition of property and protection and d extent of dia power go con increase to favour government, until finally, d notion of universal and human rights way dem no fit change-and in particular property rights-go con disappear and go con dey replaced with law as legislation way-government-make and rights and grants way government give..

D results, way be say Rothbard bin predict, dey for our eyes make everybody see am. D tax load way dem dey charge dem property owners don continue to dey increase, con dey make d economic burden even for slaves and serfs con look like say e dey moderate wen you compare am. Government gbese-and hence, future tax dduties-for don rise go up like mad. All dia private life details, property, trade, and contract don dey regulated by paper laws way high like mountain. Anyhow, d only task way government bin suppose get-na to protect our life and property- way dem no dey do. Way dey contrary, as d expenditure dey high for social, public, and national security, d more way dem don comot our private property rights, d more way dem dey collect our private property from us, seize am, destroy am, and reduce am. D more way dem dey produce paper laws, d more way we no fit sure onto our legal results, and dem don create more moral hazard, lawlessness don comot law and order. Instead make dem protect us from domestic crime and foreign aggression, our government, way don get plenty plenty weapons way fit destroy plenty things, dey aggress against d new Hitler and Hitlerite sympathizers way dem suspect say dey anywhere and everywhere outside dem own territory. In short, as we don dey ever more helpless, impoverished, threatened, and insecure, dem our state rulers don dey day more corrupt, arrogant, and dangerously armed.
