There can be no doubt, then, that taxes invariably reduce production and with this the consumer’s standard of living. Whichever way things are put, there is no escaping the conclusion that taxation is a means of obstructing the formation of wealth and thereby creating relative impoverishment.
No doubt at all, say, taxes dey invariably reduce production and for dis de consumer’s standard of living. Wicheva ways dem put things, dem nor fit escape de conclusion say taxation na way wey dem take dey block de formation of wealth and e go come thereby dey create relative impoverishment.

This brings me to my second subject: the sociology of taxation. If taxation is an instrument for the destruction of wealth-formation, then the question immediately becomes pressing of how it can be explained that there is taxation; that there is ever more of it; that we have experienced, in particular during the last hundred years, a steady increase not just in the absolute but also in the relative level of taxation; and that the institutions which lead the way in this process, the tax-states of the Western World, have simultaneously assumed ever more powerful positions in the arena of international politics and increasingly dominate the rest of the world.
Dis bring me come my second subject: de sociology of taxation. If taxation na instrument wey dem take dey destroy wealth-formation, den de question go quickly come dey pressing how dem fit take explain am say taxation dey; say more of am dey, say we don experienced am, in particular for de last hundred years, a steady increase for not only de absolute but also for de relative level of taxation; and also say de institutions wey dey lead dis process, de tax-states of de Western World, don get even more powerful positions for de arena of international politics and don dey dominate de rest of de world.

With these questions one leaves the realm of economic theory. Economics answers the question “What is the consequence if taxation is introduced?” It deduces its answer from an understanding of the meaning of action and the meaning of taxation as a particular type of action. Why there is taxation is the subject matter of psychology, history, or sociology. Economics, or rather praxeology, recognizes that all actions are determined by ideas, correct or incorrect, good or bad. But it does not attempt to explain what these ideas are and how people come to hold or change them. Rather, it assumes them to be given and aims at explaining the logical consequences that flow from acting upon them, whatever they are. History and sociology ask what these ideas are, how people come to entertain them, and why they act the way they do.[^16]
Wit dis questions person go leave de level of economic theory. Economic dey answer de question “wetin be de consequence if dem introduced taxation?” E get e answer from understanding of de meaning of action and de meaning of taxation as say na particular type of action. Why taxation dey na d subject matter of psychology, history or sociology. Economics, or rather praxeology, dey recognize say na ideas dey determine all actions, weda e correct or nor correct, weda e good or e bad. But e nor dey try explain wetin dis ideas be and how people come take hold or change dem. Rather, e dey assume say dem give dem and e aim na to explain de logical consequences wey dey flow wen dem act upon dem, wateva dem come be. History and Sociology go ask wetin dis ideas be, how people take dey reason am, and why dem dey act de way dem dey do.[^16] 

On a highly abstract level the answer to the question why there is steadily increasing taxation is this: The root cause for this is a slow but dramatic change in the idea of justice that has taken place in public opinion.
On a level wey high wella de abstract answer to de question why taxation dey increase steadilu na dis: De main cause of dis na slow but dramatic change for de idea of justice wey don take place for public opinion.

Let me explain. One can acquire property either through homesteading, production, and contracting, or else through the expropriation and exploitation of homesteaders, producers, or contractors. There are no other ways.[^17] Both methods are natural to mankind. Alongside production and contracting there has always been a process of nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions. Just as productive enterprises can develop into firms and corporations, so can the business of expropriating and exploiting occur on a larger scale and develop into governments and states.[^18] That taxation as such exists and that there is the drive toward increased taxation should hardly come as a surprise. For the idea of nonproductive or noncontractual appropriations is almost as old as the idea of productive ones, and everyone—the exploiter certainly no less than the producer—prefers a higher income to a lower one.
Make I explain am. Person fit get property either from homesteading, production, and contracting, or else from de expropriation and exploitation of homesteaders, producers, or contractors. No oda ways dey.[^17] Both methods dey natural to mankind. Wit production and contracting a process of nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisition always dey before. Just like de way productive enterprises fit develop into firms and corportations, so also de business of expropriation and exploitation go also fit happen for larger scale and fit develop into goverments and states.[^18] Say taxation like dat dey exists and also say dem dey increase taxation nor supposed come as a surprise. For de idea of nonproductive or noncontractual appropriations na almost as old as de idea of de productive ones, and everybody---de exploiter certainly nor even less than de producer---go prefers higher income to income wey low pass.
The decisive question is this: what controls and constrains the size and growth of such a business?
De main question na dis: wetin dey control and constrains de size and growth of dat kind business?

It should be clear that the constraints on the size of firms in the business of expropriating producers and contractors are of a categorically different nature than those limiting the size of firms engaged in productive exchanges. Contrary to the claim of the public choice school, government and private firms do not do essentially the same sort of business. They are engaged in categorically different types of operations.[^19]
E need to be clear say de constraints for de size of firms for de business of expropriating producers and contractors dey a very different nature dan dose wey dey limit de size of firms wey dey engaged in productive exchanges. Against de claim of de public choice school, government and private firms nor essentially dey same kind of business. Dem dey engaged in a ery different types of operations.[^19]

The size of a productive enterprise is constrained on the one hand by consumer demand (which imposes a definite limit on the total revenue attainable), and on the other hand by the competition of other producers, which continuously forces each firm to operate with the lowest possible costs if it wishes to stay in business. For such an enterprise to grow in size the most urgent consumer wants must be served in the most efficient ways. Nothing but voluntary consumer purchases support its size.
De size of a productive enterprise dey constrained for one hand by de consumer demand (wey dey force a definite limit on de total revenue dem fit get), and fo de oda hand by de competition of other producers, wich dey always forces each firm to dey operate wit de lowest possible costs if e want make e still stay for business. For dat kind enterprise to grow in size, de wants of de most urgent consumer need to be served in de most efficient ways. Nothing else except de consumers dey voluntary buy go support e size. 

The constraints on the other type of firm, of government or the state, are altogether different. For one thing, it is absurd to say that its size is determined by demand in the same sense as the size of a private firm is determined by demand. One cannot say, by any stretch of the imagination, that the homesteaders, the producers, and the contractors who must surrender part of their assets to a government have demanded such a service. Instead, they must be coerced into accepting it, and this is conclusive proof of the fact that the service is not actually in demand at all. Hence, demand cannot be considered as a limit on the size of government. Insofar as it grows, the state grows by acting in open *contradiction* to demand.
De constraints for de oda type of firm, of government or de state, dey altogeda different. For one thing, e dey absurd to say e size dey determined by demand for same sense like de size of a private firm dey determined by demand. Person nor go fit say, even if na for imagination, say de homesteaders, de producers and de contractors who go need surrender part of dia assets for government don demanded for dat kind service. Instead, dem go dey forced to accept am, and dis proof dey conclusive of de fact say  dem nor dey demand de service at all.And so, dem nor fit consider demand as a limit to de size of government. As far say e grows, de state dey grow by acting in clear *contradiction* to demand.

The state is also not in the same way constrained by competition as is a productive firm. Unlike such a firm, the state must not keep its cost of operation at a minimum but can operate at above-minimum costs because it is able to shift its higher costs onto competitors by taxing or regulating their behavior. Thus, the size of the state also cannot be considered as constrained by cost competition. Insofar as it grows, it does so in spite of the fact that it is *not* cost-efficient.
De state in same way nor also dey constrained by competition as a productive firm. Unlike dat kind firm, de state nor need keep its cost of operation for minimum but fit operate above-minimum costs bcos e dey able to shifts e higher costs for im  competitors by taxing or regulating how dem take dey behave.. So, de size of de state also dem nor fit consider am as say cost competition dey constrained am. As far as say e dey grow, e dey do dat in spite of de fact say e *nor* dey cost-efficient.

This, however, is not to say that the size of government is not constrained at all and that the historical fluctuations in the size of states are mere random walks. It only states that the constraints on the firm “government” must be fundamentally different.
Dis, nor be to say de size of government nor dey constrained at all and also say de historical fluctuations for de size of states na mere random works. E dey only say de constraints on de fim “government” must dey fundamentally different.

Instead of being constrained by cost and demand conditions, the growth of an exploitative firm is constrained by public opinion:[^20] It is not voluntarily supported, but by its very nature employs coercion. On the other side of the same coin, coercion implies creating victims, and victims are not supporters but active or passive resisters of a firm’s size. It is conceivable that this resistance can be lastingly broken by force in the case of one man, or one group of men, exploiting one or maybe two or three others, or another group of roughly the same size. It is inconceivable, however, to imagine that force alone can account for the breaking down of resistance in the actually familiar case of small minorities operating their business of expropriating and exploiting populations tens, hundreds, or thousands of times their size.[^21] For this to happen, such a firm must have public support in addition to its coercive force. A majority of the population must accept its operations as legitimate. This acceptance can range from active enthusiasm to passive resignation. But there must be acceptance in the sense that a majority must have given up the idea of actively or passively resisting any attempt to enforce nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions. Instead of displaying outrage over such actions, of showing contempt for everyone who engages in them, and of doing nothing to help make them successful (not to mention actively trying to obstruct them), a majority must actively or passively support them. Only in light of this can it be explained how the few can govern the many. State-supportive public opinion must counterbalance the resistance of victimized property owners to the extent that active resistance appears futile.
Instead of am to dey constrained by cost and demand conditions, de growth of an exploitative firm dey constrained by public opinion:[^20] E dey only dey supported voluntarily, but by e nature dey use force. For de oda side of same coin, force dey mean to create victims, and victims nor be supporters but na active or passive resisters of a firm’s size. E dey sure say dis resistance fit break last last if na case of one man, or one group of men, exploiting one maybe two or three odas, or anoda group wey get same size. Dem nor fit howeva reason or imagine say only force go fit account for de breakdown of resistance for de actually familiar case of dem small minorities wey dey operate dia business of expropriating and exploiting populations tens, hundreds or even thousands of times dia size.[^21] For dis to happen, dat kind firm must get public support even if e already dey use force. A majority of de population go need accept e operations say e legit. Dis acceptance fit range from active enthusiasm to active resignation. But acceptance need to dey in de sense say majority of dem don give up de idea of actively or passively resisting any attempt wey dem wan take enforce nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions. Instead of to dey show serious vexing for dat kind actions, or to dey show vex for everybody wey dey un am, and even to dey do nothing to help make dem successful (not even to mention actively trying to block dem), a majority need to actively o passively support dem. Na only when dis clear dem for fit explain how de small dey govern de many. State-supportive public opinion need to counterbalance de resistance of de property owners wey dem victimized to such extent say to resist na waste of time.


De state of public opinion dey also impose constraint on de size of de state in anoda respect. Every firm for de large scale business of property expropriation gats naturally aim to be monopolist for a definite territory, bcos person go only prosper for dat kind business so long as something dey wey fit dey expropriated. Howevea, if competition dey allowed for de business of expropriating, clearly  notin for dey left to take. Hence, in order to stay in business, person gats become a monopolist.

Even if no internal competition dey, competition between governments operating in *different* territories still dey, and na dis competition wey dey impose severe limits on de size of government. On one hand, e dey open up de possibility say people fit vote wit dia feet against a government and leave e territory if dey perceive say oda territories dey offer less exploitative living conditions. Naturally, each state gat to see dis as a crucial problem, for e dey literally lives off a population, and any population loss na as e be a loss of potential state-income. [^22] Again, de state of public opinion dey of utmost importance for maintaining exploitative rule. Only if de state succeed to generate de impression for de general public say  state’s own territory fit compares favorably, or at least tolerably well wit odas nai e go fit secure and expand e position.

Public opinion dey also play decisive role for de case of interstate aggression. While no be logical necessity, de nature of a state as an exploitative enterprise go still make am highly likely (nor be de least because of de  problem wey we just address of population movements) say e go become engage in aggression against a “foreign” territory, or say e gats defend eself against such aggression from oda states. [^23] Moreova, in order to emerge successfully from such interstate wars or warlike actions, a state gats dey in command of sufficient (in relative terms) economic resources wey alone go make e actions sustainable. Howeva, dese resources fit dey provided only by a productive population. So, to secure de means necessary to win wars and avoid being confronted wit slackening productive outputs while at war, public opinion again go turn out to be de decisive variable controlling de size of government. Only if popular support for de state war exists nai e go fit dey sustained and possibly won.

Finally, de state of public opinion dey limit de size of government in yet a third way. While de state dey maintain e position through de exploited population through coercion and de successful management of public opinion, to maintain e own internal order, wey dey regulate de relationship between de various branches of government and e employees, notin else dey at e disposal but public opinion, for clearly, nobody outside de state exists wey fit enforce e internal rules upon am. Instead, de enforcement gats dey accomplished exclusively by means of supportive public opinion among state employees demselves for de various branches of government.[^24]. Dat is, de president nor fit coerce de general to go to war—in fact, de greater physical strength go probably dey de general’s side; and de general in turn nor fit coerce e soldiers to do de fighting and killing—in fact, dey fit smash am anytime. President and general go only succeed bcos of favorable intrastate public opinion, and only insofar as de overwhelming majority of de state employees at least passively supports dia actions as legitimate. If, for devarious branches of government, a large majority of dem dey strictly opposed to de enforcement of presidential policy, e nor go fit dey put into action successfully. De general wey think mostly about e troops consider dewar illegitimate or wey think say de Congress, de IRS, de large majority of public educators and de so-called social services go regard such actions as outrageous and to be openly opposed, go face an impossible task even if he himself bin dey support de presidential command. [^25]

Wit public opinion instead of demand and cost conditions as e dey identified as de constraining force on de size of government,I don return to my original explanation of de phenomenon of ever-increasing taxation as “simply” a change for prevailing ideas.

If na public opinion dey ultimately limit de size of an exploitative firm, den an explanation of e growth in purely ideological terms dey justified. Truly, any oda explanation, wey nor dey in terms of ideological changes but of changes in “objective” conditions gat to dey considered wrong. De size of government nor go increase bcos any objective causes over which ideas nor get control and certainly nor be  bcos demand dey for am. E go grow bcos de ideas wey dey prevail for public opinion of wetin dey just and wetin dey wrong don change. Wetin once dey regarded by public opinion as an outrage, to be treated and dealt wit as such,don become increasingly accepted as legitimate.

Wetin don happen regarding de general public conception of justice? [^26]

[^16]:To make dis distinction between economics and history or sociology nor be to say, of course, economics nor get importance for  dese latter disciplines. In fact, economics dey indispensable for all oda social sciences. While de reverse nor be de case, economics fit dey  developed and advanced witout historical or sociological knowledge. De only consequence of doing so na say such economics go probably nor dey very interesting, as e go dey written witout consideration of real examples or instances of application (as if person be dey write on de economics of taxation even tho an actual example neva happen for all of history), for e go formulate wetin nor fit happen for de social world or wetin  go happen provided say certain conditions dey in fact fulfilled. So, any historical or sociological explanation dey logically constrained by de laws as espoused by economic theory, and any account by a historian or sociologist wey dey in violation of dese laws gats dey treated as ultimately confused. On de relationship between economic theory and history see also Ludwig von Mises, *Theory and History* (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1985); Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *Praxeology and Economic Science* (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988).

[^18]:On de theory of de state as e dey developed in de following see—in addition to de works cited in note 17—in particular Herbert Spencer, *Social Statics* (New York: Schalkenbach Foundation, 1970); Auberon Herbert, *The Right and Wrong of Compulsion by the State* (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1978); Albert J. Nock, *Our Enemy, the State* (Tampa, Fla: Hallberg Publishing, 1983); Murray N. Rothbard, *For a New Liberty* (New York: Macmillan, 1978); idem, *The Ethics of Liberty* (Atlantic Highlands, N.J.: Humanities Press, 1982); Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *Eigentum, Anarchie und Staat* (Opladen: Westdeutscher Verlag, 1987); Anthony de Jasay, *The State* (Oxford: Blackwell, 1985).

[^19]:Dis central idea of de public choice school don dey expressed by dem foremost representative as follows:

> Both de economic relation and de political relation represent cooperation on de part of two or more individuals. De market and de state na both devices thru which co-operation dey organized and made possible. Men co-operate thru exchange of goods and services in organized markets, and such co-operation dey imply mutual gain. De individual dey enter into an exchange relationship wey he dey move e own interest by providing some product or service wey dey  of direct benefit to de individual on de oda side of de transaction. At base, political or collective action under de individualistic view of de State dey much de same. Two or more individuals go find am mutually advantageous to join forces to accomplish certain common purposes. In a very real sense, dem go “exchange” and devote resources to de construction of de common good. (James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, *The Calculus of Consent* [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press], p. 192)

Surely, de most amazing tin about dat kind “new theory of politics” na say anybody take am seriously. Remarks wey Joseph A. Schumpeter make on such views:

> De theory wey construe tax on de analogy of club dues or de purchase of de service of, say, a doctor dey only prove how far removed dis part of de social sciences dey from scientific habits of mind. (*Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy* [New York: Harper, 1942],p. 198)

And H.L. Mencken get dis to say regarding one thesis such as Buchanan’s and Tullock’s:

> De average man, whateva e errors odawise, at least dey see clearly say government na sometin wey dey outside him and outside de generality of e fellow men—dat na separate, independent and often hostile power, only partly under e control, and capable of doing am great harm…. Na fact of no significance say robbing de government  everywhere dey regarded as a crime of less magnitude dan robbing one individual, or even a corporation? … Wen a private citizen dey robbed a worthy man dey deprived of de fruits of e industry and thrift; wen de government dey robbed de worst wey fit happen na  say certain rogues and loafers get less money to play wit dan dem get before. De notion say dem don earn dat money nor go ever dey entertained; to most sensible men e go seem ludicrous. Dem be simply rascals who, by accidents of law, get somewhat dubious right to a share for de earnings of dia fellow men. Wen dat share dey diminished by private enterprise de business dey, on de whole, far more laudable dan not. (*A Mencken Chrestomathy* [New York: Vintage Books, 1949] pp. 146–47)

[^20]:See on dis also Murray N. Rothbard, “The Anatomy of the State” in idem, *Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays* (Washington, D.C.: Libertarian Review Press, 1974), esp. pp. 37–42.

[^21]: Person fit tink say de government fit accomplish dat kind feat by merely improving e weaponry: by threatening wit atomic bombs instead of wit guns and rifles, so to speak. Howeva, since realistically person gats assume say de technological know-how of such improved weaponry go hardly dey secret, especially if e dey in fact applied, den wit de state’s improved instruments for instilling fear de victims’ ways amid means of resisting improve as well. Hence, such advances gats dey ruled out as an explanation of wetin need dey explained.

[^22]: Witness de all-too-numerous states, wey dey go so far as to shoot people down witout mercy, wey dem no commit any oda sin dan to try leave a territory and move elsewhere!

[^23]:On de intimate relationship between state and war see de important study by Ekkehart Krippendorff, *Staat und Krieg* (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1985); also Charles Tilly, “War Making and State Making as Organized Crime” in Peter Evans et al., eds., *Bringing the State Back In* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985).

[^24]:Dis insight (wey refute all de talk about de impossibility of anarchism to dey show dat intra-governmental relations be, in fact, one case of—political—anarchy) been don dey explained for one highly important article by Alfred G. Cuzán, “Do We Ever Really Get Out of Anarchy”, *Journal of Libertarian Studies* 3,no. 2 (1979).

> Wherever earthly governments dey establish or exist, anarchy dey dey officially prohibited for all members of society, usually referred to as subjects or citizens. Dem nor fit relate to each other again on dia own terms…. Rather, all members of society gat to accept an external “third party”—a government—into dia relationships, a third party wit de coercive powers to enforce e judgments and punish detractors…. Howeva, dat kind “third party” arrangement for society dey non-existent among dose wey dey exercise de power of government demselves. In oda words, no “third party” dey to make and enforce judgments among de individual members wey make up de third party itself. De rulers still dey in a state of anarchy *thru* each oda. Dem dey settle disputes *among demselves*, witout regard for a Government (an entity outside demselves). Anarchy still dey exist. Only whereas witout government na market or natural anarchy,  now na *political* anarchy, an anarchy inside power. (Cuzán, pp. 152–53)

[^25]:One of de classic expositors of dis idea na David Hume. For e essay, “Of The First Principles of Government”, he write:

> Notin dey appear more surprising to dose wey dey consider human affairs wit  philosophical eye, dan de easiness wit wich many dey governed by de few; and de implicit submission, wit which men dey resign dia own sentiments and passions for dia rulers own. Wen we enquire by which means dis wonder dey effected, we go find, say as FORCE always dey de side of de governed, de governors nor get anytin to support dem apart from  opinion. E as e be so,mean say na only on opinion nai government dey founded; and dis maxim don extends to de most despotic and most military governments, as well as to de most free and most popular. De soldan of EGYPT, or de emperor of ROME, fit drive e harmless subjects, like brute beasts, against dia sentiments and inclination: but e gat, at least, don lead e *mamalukes*, or *praetorian bands*, like men, by dia opinion.
