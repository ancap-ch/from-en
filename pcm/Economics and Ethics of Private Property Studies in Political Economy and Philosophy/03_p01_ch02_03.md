No doubt at all, say, taxes dey invariably reduce production and for dis de consumer’s standard of living. Wicheva ways dem put things, dem nor fit escape de conclusion say taxation na way wey dem take dey block de formation of wealth and e go come thereby dey create relative impoverishment.

Dis bring me come my second subject: de sociology of taxation. If taxation na instrument wey dem take dey destroy wealth-formation, den de question go quickly come dey pressing how dem fit take explain am say taxation dey; say more of am dey, say we don experienced am, in particular for de last hundred years, a steady increase for not only de absolute but also for de relative level of taxation; and also say de institutions wey dey lead dis process, de tax-states of de Western World, don get even more powerful positions for de arena of international politics and don dey dominate de rest of de world.

Wit dis questions person go leave de level of economic theory. Economic dey answer de question “wetin be de consequence if dem introduced taxation?” E get e answer from understanding of de meaning of action and de meaning of taxation as say na particular type of action. Why taxation dey na d subject matter of psychology, history or sociology. Economics, or rather praxeology, dey recognize say na ideas dey determine all actions, weda e correct or nor correct, weda e good or e bad. But e nor dey try explain wetin dis ideas be and how people come take hold or change dem. Rather, e dey assume say dem give dem and e aim na to explain de logical consequences wey dey flow wen dem act upon dem, wateva dem come be. History and Sociology go ask wetin dis ideas be, how people take dey reason am, and why dem dey act de way dem dey do.[^16] 

On a level wey high wella de abstract answer to de question why taxation dey increase steadilu na dis: De main cause of dis na slow but dramatic change for de idea of justice wey don take place for public opinion.

Make I explain am. Person fit get property either from homesteading, production, and contracting, or else from de expropriation and exploitation of homesteaders, producers, or contractors. No oda ways dey.[^17] Both methods dey natural to mankind. Wit production and contracting a process of nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisition always dey before. Just like de way productive enterprises fit develop into firms and corportations, so also de business of expropriation and exploitation go also fit happen for larger scale and fit develop into goverments and states.[^18] Say taxation like dat dey exists and also say dem dey increase taxation nor supposed come as a surprise. For de idea of nonproductive or noncontractual appropriations na almost as old as de idea of de productive ones, and everybody---de exploiter certainly nor even less than de producer---go prefers higher income to income wey low pass.

De main question na dis: wetin dey control and constrains de size and growth of dat kind business?

E need to be clear say de constraints for de size of firms for de business of expropriating producers and contractors dey a very different nature dan dose wey dey limit de size of firms wey dey engaged in productive exchanges. Against de claim of de public choice school, government and private firms nor essentially dey same kind of business. Dem dey engaged in a ery different types of operations.[^19]

De size of a productive enterprise dey constrained for one hand by de consumer demand (wey dey force a definite limit on de total revenue dem fit get), and fo de oda hand by de competition of other producers, wich dey always forces each firm to dey operate wit de lowest possible costs if e want make e still stay for business. For dat kind enterprise to grow in size, de wants of de most urgent consumer need to be served in de most efficient ways. Nothing else except de consumers dey voluntary buy go support e size. 

De constraints for de oda type of firm, of government or de state, dey altogeda different. For one thing, e dey absurd to say e size dey determined by demand for same sense like de size of a private firm dey determined by demand. Person nor go fit say, even if na for imagination, say de homesteaders, de producers and de contractors who go need surrender part of dia assets for government don demanded for dat kind service. Instead, dem go dey forced to accept am, and dis proof dey conclusive of de fact say  dem nor dey demand de service at all.And so, dem nor fit consider demand as a limit to de size of government. As far say e grows, de state dey grow by acting in clear *contradiction* to demand.

De state in same way nor also dey constrained by competition as a productive firm. Unlike dat kind firm, de state nor need keep its cost of operation for minimum but fit operate above-minimum costs bcos e dey able to shifts e higher costs for im  competitors by taxing or regulating how dem take dey behave.. So, de size of de state also dem nor fit consider am as say cost competition dey constrained am. As far as say e dey grow, e dey do dat in spite of de fact say e *nor* dey cost-efficient.

Dis, nor be to say de size of government nor dey constrained at all and also say de historical fluctuations for de size of states na mere random works. E dey only say de constraints on de fim “government” must dey fundamentally different.

Instead of am to dey constrained by cost and demand conditions, de growth of an exploitative firm dey constrained by public opinion:[^20] E dey only dey supported voluntarily, but by e nature dey use force. For de oda side of same coin, force dey mean to create victims, and victims nor be supporters but na active or passive resisters of a firm’s size. E dey sure say dis resistance fit break last last if na case of one man, or one group of men, exploiting one maybe two or three odas, or anoda group wey get same size. Dem nor fit howeva reason or imagine say only force go fit account for de breakdown of resistance for de actually familiar case of dem small minorities wey dey operate dia business of expropriating and exploiting populations tens, hundreds or even thousands of times dia size.[^21] For dis to happen, dat kind firm must get public support even if e already dey use force. A majority of de population go need accept e operations say e legit. Dis acceptance fit range from active enthusiasm to active resignation. But acceptance need to dey in de sense say majority of dem don give up de idea of actively or passively resisting any attempt wey dem wan take enforce nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions. Instead of to dey show serious vexing for dat kind actions, or to dey show vex for everybody wey dey un am, and even to dey do nothing to help make dem successful (not even to mention actively trying to block dem), a majority need to actively o passively support dem. Na only when dis clear dem for fit explain how de small dey govern de many. State-supportive public opinion need to counterbalance de resistance of de property owners wey dem victimized to such extent say to resist na waste of time.

De state of public opinion dey also impose constraint on de size of de state in anoda respect. Every firm for de large-scale business of property expropriation gats naturally aim to be monopolist for a definite territory, bcos person go only prosper for dat kind business so long as something dey wey fit dey expropriated. Howevea, if competition dey allowed for de business of expropriating, clearly  notin for dey left to take. Hence, in order to stay in business, one gats become a monopolist.

Even if no internal competition dey, competition between governments operating in *different* territories still dey, and na dis competition wey dey impose severe limits on de size of government. On one hand, e dey open up de possibility say people fit vote wit dia feet against a government and leave e territory if dey perceive say oda territories dey offer less exploitative living conditions. Naturally, each state gat to see dis as a crucial problem, for e dey literally lives off a population, and any population loss na as e be a loss of potential state-income.[^22] Again, de state of public opinion dey of utmost importance for maintaining exploitative rule. Only if de state succeed to generate de impression for de general public say  state’s own territory fit compares favorably, or at least tolerably well wit odas nai e go fit secure and expand e position.

Public opinion dey also play decisive role for de case of interstate aggression. While no be logical necessity, de nature of a state as an exploitative enterprise go still make am highly likely (nor be de least because of de  problem wey we just address of population movements) say e go become engage in aggression against a “foreign” territory, or say e gats defend eself against such aggression from oda states.[^23] Moreova, in order to emerge successfully from such interstate wars or warlike actions, a state gats dey in command of sufficient (in relative terms) economic resources wey alone go make e actions sustainable. Howeva, dese resources fit dey provided only by a productive population. So, to secure de means necessary to win wars and avoid being confronted wit slackening productive outputs while at war, public opinion again go turn out to be de decisive variable controlling de size of government. Only if popular support for de state’s war exists nai e go fit dey sustained and possibly won.

Finally, de state of public opinion dey limit de size of government in yet a third way. While de state dey maintain e position through de exploited population through coercion and de successful management of public opinion, to maintain e own internal order, wey dey regulate de relationships between de various branches of government and e employees, notin else dey at e disposal but public opinion, for clearly, nobody outside de state exists wey fit enforce e internal rules upon am. Instead, de enforcement gats dey accomplished exclusively by means of supportive public opinion among state employees demselves for de various branches of government.[^24]. Dat is, de president nor fit coerce de general to go to war—in fact, de greater physical strength go probably dey de general’s side; and de general in turn nor fit coerce e soldiers to do de fighting and killing—in fact, dey fit smash am anytime. President and general go only succeed bcos of favorable intrastate public opinion, and only insofar as de overwhelming majority of de state employees at least passively supports dia actions as legitimate. If, for devarious branches of government, a large majority of dem dey strictly opposed to de enforcement of presidential policy, e nor go fit dey put into action successfully. De general wey think mostly about e troops consider dewar illegitimate or wey think say de Congress, de IRS, de large majority of public educators and de so-called social services go regard such actions as outrageous and to be openly opposed, go face an impossible task even if he himself bin dey support de presidential command.[^25]

Wit public opinion instead of dan demand and cost conditions as e dey identified as de constraining force on de size of government, I don return to my original explanation of de phenomenon of ever-increasing taxation as “simply” a change for prevailing ideas.

If na public opinion dey ultimately limit de size of an exploitative firm, den an explanation of e growth in purely ideological terms dey justified. Truly, any oda explanation, wey nor dey in terms of ideological changes but of changes in “objective” conditions gat to dey  considered wrong. De size of government nor go increase bcos any objective causes over which ideas nor get control and certainly nor be  bcos demand dey for am. E go grow bcos de ideas wey dey prevail for public opinion of wetin dey just and wetin dey wrong don change. Wetin once dey regarded by public opinion as an outrage, to be treated and dealt wit as such, don become increasingly accepted as legitimate.

Wetin don happen regarding de general public’s conception of justice?[^26]

[^16]: To make dis distinction between economics and history or sociology nor be to say, of course, say economics nor get importance for  dese latter disciplines. In fact, economics dey indispensable for all oda social sciences. While de reverse nor be de case, economics fit dey  developed and advanced witout historical or sociological knowledge. De only consequence of doing so na say such economics go probably nor dey very interesting, as e go dey written witout consideration of real examples or instances of application (as if person be dey write on de economics of taxation even tho an actual example neva happen for all of history), for e go formulate wetin nor fit happen for de social world or wetin  go happen provided say certain conditions dey in fact fulfilled. So, any historical or sociological explanation dey logically constrained by de laws as espoused by economic theory, and any account by a historian or sociologist wey dey in violation of dese laws gats dey treated as ultimately confused.
