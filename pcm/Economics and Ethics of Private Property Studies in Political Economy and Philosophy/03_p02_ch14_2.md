### Positivism and Destruction wey Concern Ethics and Economics

E nor get doctrine wey dey Philosophical for this our days wey don contribute well well make relativism go far pass positivism. As e dey inside classical empiricism wey Locke and Hume talk, e con come out first for Vietnam around dat century time and e com get ground well well, especially when all dose leaders wey sabi somtin com dey comot enter U.S for 1930s, as e com be the place wey philosophy get ground pass for Western world.[^11]

If e be say you gree to wetin Positivism talk, e mean say you nor go gree with wetin rationalism talk wen dem put am for inside nature and even social sciences, , wetin e don do, we don feel am well well dis days. If we wan dey sure, we nor go even fit argue am sef say even for natural sciences, especially for logic and protophysics, don suffer well well from wetin positivism bring.[^12] However, for reasons wey we don already talk before, , to com comot rationalism for wetin we wan talk so go hard well well. If we wan agree from how relativist tey dey look am, e go come mean say we go com leave de means wey involve brain if person wan handle nature for way wey go dey successful, and nobody wey go fit talk say na dis one be de difference between success and failure wey go get systematic interest if e wan pay dat kind price. And e different for matter wey concern social sciences. Even up till now, case wey concern social relativism nor dey too appear say e get ground pass de case wey concern natural sciences, and if I wan demonstrate am for de ones wey dey go come dey baseless, wey dey advocate and wey dey carry relativism join body for social sciences nor go fit defeat eself for de same sense as e join science wey concern nature. If person wan deny say absolute law of economics and/or ethics dey exist and de possibility wey concern social progress, as dem go don pay de price too. But instead, dem fit nor pay de price directly, and dat one go come mean say dem go pay am in full by anybody wey carry de view join body and wey dey use this view. Instead, person wey adopt am go fit put de money wey dey ontop de view for oda people body; derefor, as far as say relativism go fit serve as way wey person fit increase e well being as e dey reduce oda people own, individuals go come get interest if dem dey push for social relativism.[^13]

Na dis thing na im dey explain why de power wey positivism carry don make dem feel am well well for social sciences especially. Whether all dem positivists be think am at all or dem no think am, de message wey dem be dey pass wey concern philosophy, all dose big big people wey dey on top quick feel am say na very powerful weapon if dem wan dey pursue dere own goal wey e be to increase the power wey dem get over oda people and dem go dem pack plenty plenty riches wey others nor even see any. As we see am, positivist movement com get plenty plenty support, and dis movement com still give all dis people better better things wen dem scatter economics and ethics because na im be de traditional oga patapata for social rationalism and dem com remove plenty plenty things wey be dey people mind wey first be part wey dem nor go comot wey concern de western thought and civilization wey dem be carry for head.[^14]

[^14]: Look Mises, *Human Action*, part 7; idem, *The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science* (Kansas City: Sheed Andrews and McMeel, 1978), esp. chaps. 5–8, which come end with dis kain statement:

::::> As far as say de principles wey empiricist talk wey concern logical positivism still dey point give experimental methods wey concern natural sciences, e com simply dey confirm wetin nobody go fit to argue. As far as say e don reject de principle wey concern epistemology of science wey still concern wetin human bin dey do, e nor dey too wrong like dat. E mean say e purposely with all e mind com dey carry com down matter wey concern intellectual foundations wey still concern western civilization. (p. 133)

De first principle wey na im still important pass wey concern positivism na say: Knowledge wey concern reality or *wetin concern experience* knowledge, dem must fit to verify am or at least talk say na lie by wetin person don still experience; say anything at all, dem know am by experience fit still dey in anoda way or dem fit turn am put for anoda way too, say nothing wey concern real life dem go fit know am say na true a priori; say all a priori proposition wey be true na statements wey e be say dey *analytical* wey no get content wey get fact at all but say e be true because of say people don gather, wey dey be like information wey nor clear to understand wey concern how to tey dey use symbols and de rules wey fit to transform dem; say statements wey dey normal nor be statements wey dey for empirical or analytical side, nor fit claim truth for way wey dey correct, but make we regard am as all dis kain play play talk wey concern aw person dey feel, talk talk, for wetin person go fit do, wey nor pass “wow” or “grrr.”[^15]

[^15]: No look anoda place except Alfred J. Ayer, *Language, Truth, and Logic* (New York: Dover, 1946).

De second principle wey concern positivism come form one kain extension or for anoda way, e com be part wey dey use de first one put for de problem wey scientific explanation dey bring. If we follow wetin positivism talk, if we wan use am tey explain one kain situation wey dey real na to form one kain statement wey be either de type “if ::A::, then ::B::” or, make de variables dey allow measurements wey concern quantity, “if wetin rise (or wetin fall) dey for ::A::, den if e rise (or if e fall) go still dey for ::B::”. As de talk wey dey point give wetin dey real (wey concern ::A:: and ::B:: say na situation wey dey real, na im be say), de validity wey e sopoz get, dem nor fit make am say e dey certain if dem look only de proposition or any other talk wey dem be bring where na from dere dem fit bring out one question with logic, but e go continue to be dem say dem say and e go come dey depend on wetin go come out for experiences wey dey front front wey dem nor fit know before dat time. If experience com later confirm de explanation wey be dem say dem say, that is if person com observe one kain situation wey e be say ::B:: com true true dey follow ::A:: as dem first predict am, dis one nor go come prove am say dat dem say dem say na true, since ::A:: and ::B:: na general, and language wey dem nor fit understand (“wey dey everywhere, wey different from wetin dey for proper names”) wey dey point give situation or event wey get (or, at least *might*, in principle be)and wey get plenty plenty examples and later, wetin people don experience nor fit prove am say na lie. And if say experience com fit show say one dem say dem say na lie, that is, if person com look well well com see say ::A:: wey ::B:: nor follow, dem nor go fit decide dis kain one to be e nor go still dey possible say situation wey still concern dem say dem say e true true dey connected and some kind circumstances or variable wey dem nor  fit control and wey dem don first comot before don come stop de relationship wey dem be don dey see for front front wey dem nor fit see am again. If we talk/show say na lie, e go only show say dat particular dem say dem say wey dem be dey investigate before nor be dey correct finish because as e be, dem need to do some kain refinement, some variables wey dem go add wey dey specific wey person go need to control if e wan fit see that relationship wey dey front front between ::A:: and ::B::. However, if we talk am say e nor correct no go fit ever prove am say de relationship wey go dey for some kain situation no even exist sef.[^16]

Hempel, *Aspects of Scientific Explanations* (New York: Free Press, 1970); Ernest Nagel, *The Structure of Science* (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1961).

Last last, positivism com dey claim say all dese two principle wey relate with each oda, dem apply for everywhere, even com touch all de areas wey concern knowledge (de thesis wey concern “the unity of science”): E nor go get a priori knowledge wey concern nature or even de social reality wey concern wetin human being dey do and knowledge dey even exist; and de structure wey concern explanations for science na de same thing even if we remove mind for de subject matter.[^17]

Assuming for the moment this doctrine to be correct, it is easy to recognize its relativistic implications. Ethics is not a cognitive discipline. Any normative statement is just as well-, or rather, ill-founded as any other one. But then, what is wrong with everyone trying to impose on others whatever one wishes? Surely nothing. Everything is allowed. Ethics is reduced to the question “what can I get away with?” What better message could there be for those in power: for the cannibal king, for the slave owner, or for the holders of government office! It is precisely what they want to hear: might is and makes right.

Similarly, they must be thrilled about the message of positivism as regards the positive sciences. In the natural sciences, the positivist doctrine is relatively harmless. Disciplines such as logic and protophysics, whose propositions are generally considered a priori true (nonfalsifiable by experience), are interpreted by positivists as containing no “real” knowledge at all, as empirically empty formalisms. This view has helped legitimize and further the degeneration of parts of logic and mathematics into meaningless symbolic games, of which the general public has remained largely ignorant due to the arcane nature of the subject.[^18] But it has not, nor could it have, changed the fact that at least some propositions of logic and mathematics are employed as the very foundation of the empirical natural sciences, and hence are actually treated as containing empirical information, though of a nonhypothetical kind.[^19] Nor is there much harm in the positivist view of the empirical natural sciences, such as physics. Its methodology, according to which one can never definitively establish whether a hypothesized relationship between two or more variables exists or not, offers the possibility that one might cling to one’s hypotheses regardless of all seemingly falsifying experiences, for one could always blame a previously neglected variable for one’s predictive failures. However, as explained above no one trying to produce some given physical event would systematically prefer finding excuses for not reaching this goal over actually reaching it because he alone would have to pay the price for such stubbornness.

[^18]: See Kambartel, *Erfahrung und Struktur*, esp. pp. 236–42\. The rationalist conception of logic and mathematics is summarized by Gottlob Frege’s dictum that “it follows from the truth of the axioms, that they do not contradict each other.” The positivist-formalist interpretation, on the other hand, is formulated by the young D. Hilbert: “If the arbitrarily assumed axioms do not lead to contradictory implications, then they are true, and the objects defined by the axioms exist” (quoted from Kambartel, p. 239).

::::The advance of formalism, then, explains Kambartel, has far-reaching consequences.

::::> The retreat of mathematics from all practical justification, and from the corresponding epistemological justification of formalism, is itself a practical decision of the utmost importance. It is the abandonment of practical justification and, since formal systems without a meaningful interpretation of their starting point cannot justify anything, ultimately of the justification of propositions altogether. (p. 241)

::::In consequence,

::::> many formal analyses become a high-bred game of an interested few, although without the public noticing it, because of its inability to attain the level of discussion that is required here to determine the borderline between theory and game. (p. 238)

In the realm of the social sciences, however, where the costs of one’s actions can be externalized onto others, this possibility of immunizing one’s hypotheses from falsification offers welcome opportunities to those in power.

Consider some typical economic propositions: Whenever an exchange is not voluntary but is coerced, such as highway robbery or taxation, one exchange party profits at the expense of the other. Or: Whenever minimum wage laws are enforced that require wage rates to be higher than existing market wages, involuntary unemployment will result. Or: Whenever the quantity of money is increased while the demand for money is unchanged, the purchasing power of money will fall. Or: Any supply of money is “optimal” such that no increase in the supply of money can raise the overall standard of living (while it can have redistributive effects). Or: Collective ownership of all factors of production makes cost-accounting impossible, and thus leads to a lower output in terms of consumer evaluations. Or: Taxation of income producers raises their effective time preference rate, and thus leads to a lower output of goods produced. Apparently, these propositions contain knowledge about reality, yet they do not seem to be falsifiable but are true by definition.[^20] However, according to positivism this cannot be so. Insofar as they claim to be empirically meaningful statements, they must be hypotheses subject to empirical confirmation or falsification. One can formulate the very opposite of the above propositions without thereby stating anything that could be recognized from the outset, a priori, as false (and nonsensical). Experience would have to decide the matter. Thus, in assuming the positivist doctrine, the highway robber, taxman, union official or the Federal Reserve Board would act legitimately, from a scientific point of view, in claiming that taxation benefits the taxed and increases productive output, minimum wage laws increase employment, and the creation of paper money generates all-around prosperity. As a good positivist, one would have to admit that these are merely hypotheses, too. With the predicted effects being benevolent, however, surely they should be put into effect and tried out. After all, one should not close one’s eyes to new experience, and one should always be willing to react flexibly and open-mindedly, depending on the outcome of such an experience. However, if the outcome is not as hypothesized, and the robbed or taxed do not appear to benefit, employment actually decreases, or economic cycles rather than all-around prosperity ensue, the possibility of immunizing one’s hypotheses becomes a real, almost irresistibly tempting option. For why would the robber, the taxman, or the Federal Reserve Board *not* want to continuously play down all apparently falsifying experiences as merely accidental, so long as he can personally profit from conducting their robbing-, taxing-, or money-creating experiment? Why would he *not* want to interpret all apparent falsifications as experiences that had been produced by some unfortunately neglected circumstance and that would disappear and turn into their very opposite, revealing the true relationship between taxes, minimum wage laws, the creation of money, and prosperity once these circumstances were controlled?

[^20]: See on this the two foremost economic treatises of our times: Mises’s *Human Action*, and Rothbard’s *Man, Economy, and State*.

In fact, whatever empirical evidence one presents against these hypotheses, as soon as one adopts positivism and rejects the idea of formulating a *principled* case either for or against them as ill-conceived, the robber’s or the taxman’s case is safe from decisive criticism because any failure can be ascribed to an as yet uncontrolled intervening variable. Not even the most perfectly controlled experiment could change this situation. For it would never be possible to control all variables that might conceivably have an influence on the variable to be explained or the result to be produced. In practice, this would involve controlling literally all of the universe, and in theory no one even knows what all the variables which make up this universe *are*. No matter what the charges brought against the robber, the taxman, or the Federal Reserve Board, within the boundaries of the positivist methodology they will always be able to preserve and rescue the “hard-core” of their “research program” as the neo-Popperian positivist Lakatos would have called it. Experience only tells us that a particular experiment did not reach its goal, but it can never tell us if a slightly different one will produce any different results, or if it is possible to reach the goal of generating all-around prosperity by means of *any* form of robbery, taxation, or paper money creation.

The attitude toward positive economics that positivism fuels and that has indeed become characteristic of most contemporary power elites and their subsidized intellectual bodyguards is that of a relativist social engineer whose motto is “nothing can be known with certainty to be impossible in the realm of social phenomena and there is nothing that one might not want to try out on one’s fellowmen, so long as one keeps an open mind.”[^21]

[^21]: See also Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism* (Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1989), chap. 6; idem, “The Intellectual Cover for Socialism,” *Free Market* (February 1988).

The fact that positivism supports the mentality of social relativism does not prove it wrong. However, suspicion regarding its validity seems appropriate. It certainly is not obvious that there should be no rational ethical standard at all and that literally “anything goes.” Nor is it intuitively plausible that economics should be either an empirically meaningless symbolic game (a system of analytic propositions), or a set of hypothetical, empirically falsifiable predictions concerning the outcome of human actions and interactions. In the former case it would be nothing but a waste of time, and in the latter economics would obviously be impotent and hence irrelevant (if anything, the baker in ancient Athens could have predicted the behavior of his fellowmen *better and with a higher degree of confidence* than his modern counterpart!). However, economic propositions such as those mentioned above are apparently neither meaningless nor irrelevant. Indeed, in light of the self-serving implications of positivism for those in power, it may well be suspected that positivism might come to be accepted even if it were false, and that it might continue even if its falsehoods were exposed—as they surely have been.

Each of the three interrelated premises of positivism is demonstrably false.[^22]

[^22]: See on the following Mises, *The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science*; Murray N. Rothbard, *Individualism and the Philosophy of the Social Sciences* (San Francisco: Cato, 1979); Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *Praxeology and Economic Science* (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988); idem, “On Praxeology and the Praxeological Foundations of Epistemology and Ethics”; also Martin Hollis and Edward Nell, *Rational Economic Man* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975), Introduction.

Regarding positivism’s supposedly exhaustive classification of analytic, empirical, and emotive propositions one must ask: What, then, is the status of this very axiom? It must be either an analytical or an empirical proposition, or it must be an expression of emotions. If it is taken to be analytical, then it is merely empty verbal quibble, saying nothing about anything real, but only defining one sound or symbol by another. Hence, one would simply have to shrug one’s shoulders and reply “so what?” The same response would be appropriate if the positivist argument were taken to be an empirical proposition. If this were the case, it would have to be admitted that the proposition might well be wrong and that one would be entitled to know the criterion on the basis of which one would have to decide whether or not it was. More decisively, as an empirical proposition it could merely state a historical fact and would thus be entirely irrelevant in determining whether or not it would be possible to ever produce propositions that were empirical and yet nonfalsifiable, or normative, yet nonemotive. Finally, if the positivist line of reasoning were assumed to be an emotive proposition, then according to its own doctrine it is cognitively meaningless and contains no claim to truth whatsoever, and one would not need to pay any more attention to it than to a barking dog.

Thus, one must conclude from the outset that positivism is an utter failure. It does not prove that there can be no rational ethic. Nor can it even be considered an epistemology, a justifiable theory of knowledge. For if it were, then positivism’s most basic premise would have to be a synthetic a priori statement (empirical, but unfalsifiable), whose existence positivism denies. Thus, one would have landed in the camp of social rationalism.

Similarly, positivism’s claim that all scientific explanations are hypothetical is self-defeating. (For what is the status of this explanation?)[^23] In order to see this, let it be assumed that an explanation relating two or more events has been found to fit one set of data, and that it is then applied to a second data set, presumably to undergo further empirical testing. Now one must ask: What is the presupposition which must be made in order to relate the second experience to the first one as either confirming or falsifying it? It might seem that if in the second instance of experience the observations of the first were repeated this would be a confirmation, and if not, a falsification. Clearly, the positivist methodology assumes this to be obvious. But this is not true. Experience only reveals that two or more observations regarding the temporal sequence of two or more types of events can be “neutrally” classified as “repetition” or “nonrepetition.” A neutral repetition only becomes a “positive” confirmation and a nonrepetition a “negative” falsification if independent of what can actually be discovered by experience, it is assumed that there are constant, time-invariantly operating causes. If, contrary to this, it is assumed that causes in the course of time might operate sometimes this way and sometimes that way, then these repetitive or nonrepetitive occurrences simply are and remain neutrally registered experiences, completely independent of one another. They are not in any way logically related to each other as confirming or falsifying one another. There is one experience and there is another, they are the same or they are different, but that is all there is to it; nothing else follows.

[^23]: See on the following also Hoppe, *Kritik der kausalwissenschaftlichen Sozialforschung*; see also supra chap. 7.

Thus, the presupposition of being able to say “falsify” or “confirm” is the constancy principle: the conviction that observable phenomena are in principle determined by causes that are constant and time-invariant in the way they operate. Only if the constancy principle is assumed to be valid does it follow from any failure to reproduce a result that there is something wrong with an original hypothesis; and only then can a successful reproduction indeed be interpreted as a confirmation. Obviously, this constancy principle is not itself based on or derived from experience. There is not only no observable link connecting events, but even if such a link existed, experience could not reveal whether or not it was time-invariant. The principle cannot be disproved by experience either, since any event which might appear to disprove it (such as a failure to duplicate some result) could be interpreted from the outset as if experience had shown here merely that one *particular* type of event was not the cause of another. However, to the extent that experience cannot exclude the possibility that *another* set of events might actually be found which would turn out to be time-invariant in its way of operating, the validity of the constancy principle cannot be disproved.

Nonetheless, although neither derived from nor disprovable by experience, the constancy principle is nothing less than the logically necessary presupposition for experiences which can be regarded as either confirming or falsifying each other (in contrast to isolated, logically unconnected experiences). Hence, since positivism assumes the existence of such logically related experiences, it must be concluded that it also assumes the existence of nonhypothetical knowledge about reality. It must assume that there are indeed time-invariantly operating causes, and it must assume this to be the case although experience could never possibly prove or disprove it. Once again, positivism turns out to be an inconsistent, contradictory philosophy. There exist nonhypothetical explanations of real things.

Finally (and by now not surprisingly), the positivist thesis of the unity of science turns out to be self-contradictory. Positivism claims that actions, just as any other phenomenon, can and must be explained by means of hypotheses which can be confirmed or refuted by experience. If this were the case, then—contrary to its own doctrine that there can be no a priori knowledge about reality—positivism would be forced to assume that with respect to actions time-invariantly operating causes exist. In order to proceed as positivism wants us to proceed—to relate different experiences regarding sequences of events as either confirming or falsifying each other—a constancy over time in the operation of causes must be presupposed (as has already been explained). However, if this were true and actions could indeed be conceived of as governed by time-invariantly operating causes, what about explaining the explainers, i.e., those who carry on the very process of hypothesis creation, of verification and falsification; all of us, that is, who act the way the positivists tell us to act? Evidently, to do all this—to assimilate confirming or falsifying experiences, to replace old hypotheses with new ones—one must assumedly be able to learn. However, if one can learn from experience, and the positivist is compelled to admit this, then one cannot know at any given time what one will know at later times and how one will act based on this knowledge. Rather, one can only reconstruct the causes of one’s actions after the event, since one can only explain one’s knowledge after one already possesses it. Thus, the positivist methodology applied to the field of knowledge and action, which contains knowledge as its necessary ingredient, is simply contradictory—a logical absurdity.

The constancy principle can and indeed must be assumed within the sphere of natural objects, i.e., for phenomena that are *not* constituted by one’s own knowledge or actions manifesting that knowledge (in this sphere the question of whether there are law-governed constants on the basis of which it becomes possible to make *exante* predictions is positively determined independent of experience, and empirical factors play a role only in determining which concrete variables are causally linked to which concrete effect variables, and which are not). With respect to knowledge and action, on the other hand, the constancy principle cannot be valid (in this sphere of phenomena, the question of whether or not there are constants is itself empirical in nature and can only be decided for a given variable on the basis of past experience, that is, *ex post*). And all this, which is definitely knowledge about something real, can be known apodictically. Hence, a methodological *dualism* rather than the positivist monism must be accepted and admitted as absolutely a priori true.
