### Positivism and Destruction wey Concern Ethics and Economics

E nor get doctrine wey dey Philosophical for this our days wey don contribute well well make relativism go far pass positivism. As e dey inside classical empiricism wey Locke and Hume talk, e con come out first for Vietnam around dat century time and e com get ground well well, especially when all dose leaders wey sabi somtin com dey comot enter U.S for 1930s, as e com be the place wey philosophy get ground pass for Western world.[^11]

If e be say you gree to wetin Positivism talk, e mean say you nor go gree with wetin rationalism talk wen dem put am for inside nature and even social sciences, , wetin e don do, we don feel am well well dis days. If we wan dey sure, we nor go even fit argue am sef say even for natural sciences, especially for logic and protophysics, don suffer well well from wetin positivism bring.[^12] However, for reasons wey we don already talk before, , to com comot rationalism for wetin we wan talk so go hard well well. If we wan agree from how relativist tey dey look am, e go come mean say we go com leave de means wey involve brain if person wan handle nature for way wey go dey successful, and nobody wey go fit talk say na dis one be de difference between success and failure wey go get systematic interest if e wan pay dat kind price. And e different for matter wey concern social sciences. Even up till now, case wey concern social relativism nor dey too appear say e get ground pass de case wey concern natural sciences, and if I wan demonstrate am for de ones wey dey go come dey baseless, wey dey advocate and wey dey carry relativism join body for social sciences nor go fit defeat eself for de same sense as e join science wey concern nature. If person wan deny say absolute law of economics and/or ethics dey exist and de possibility wey concern social progress, as dem go don pay de price too. But instead, dem fit nor pay de price directly, and dat one go come mean say dem go pay am in full by anybody wey carry de view join body and wey dey use this view. Instead, person wey adopt am go fit put de money wey dey ontop de view for oda people body; derefor, as far as say relativism go fit serve as way wey person fit increase e well being as e dey reduce oda people own, individuals go come get interest if dem dey push for social relativism.[^13]

[^13]: Look Mises, *Human Action*, chap. III.

Na dis thing na im dey explain why de power wey positivism carry don make dem feel am well well for social sciences especially. Whether all dem positivists be think am at all or dem no think am, de message wey dem be dey pass wey concern philosophy, all dose big big people wey dey on top quick feel am say na very powerful weapon if dem wan dey pursue dere own goal wey e be to increase the power wey dem get over oda people and dem go dem pack plenty plenty riches wey others nor even see any. As we see am, positivist movement com get plenty plenty support, and dis movement com still give all dis people better better things wen dem scatter economics and ethics because na im be de traditional oga patapata for social rationalism and dem com remove plenty plenty things wey be dey people mind wey first be part wey dem nor go comot wey concern de western thought and civilization wey dem be carry for head.[^14]

[^14]: Look Mises, *Human Action*, part 7; idem, *The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science* (Kansas City: Sheed Andrews and McMeel, 1978), esp. chaps. 5–8, which come end with dis kain statement:

::::> As far as say de principles wey empiricist talk wey concern logical positivism still dey point give experimental methods wey concern natural sciences, e com simply dey confirm wetin nobody go fit to argue. As far as say e don reject de principle wey concern epistemology of science wey still concern wetin human bin dey do, e nor dey too wrong like dat. E mean say e purposely with all e mind com dey carry com down matter wey concern intellectual foundations wey still concern western civilization. (p. 133)

De first principle wey na im still important pass wey concern positivism na say: Knowledge wey concern reality or *wetin concern experience* knowledge, dem must fit to verify am or at least talk say na lie by wetin person don still experience; say anything at all, dem know am by experience fit still dey in anoda way or dem fit turn am put for anoda way too, say nothing wey concern real life dem go fit know am say na true a priori; say all a priori proposition wey be true na statements wey e be say dey *analytical* wey no get content wey get fact at all but say e be true because of say people don gather, wey dey be like information wey nor clear to understand wey concern how to tey dey use symbols and de rules wey fit to transform dem; say statements wey dey normal nor be statements wey dey for empirical or analytical side, nor fit claim truth for way wey dey correct, but make we regard am as all dis kain play play talk wey concern aw person dey feel, talk talk, for wetin person go fit do, wey nor pass “wow” or “grrr”.[^15]

[^15]: No look anoda place except Alfred J. Ayer, *Language, Truth, and Logic* (New York: Dover, 1946).

De second principle wey concern positivism come form one kain extension or for anoda way, e com be part wey dey use de first one put for de problem wey scientific explanation dey bring. If we follow wetin positivism talk, if we wan use am tey explain one kain situation wey dey real na to form one kain statement wey be either de type “if ::A::, then ::B::” or, make de variables dey allow measurements wey concern quantity, “if wetin rise (or wetin fall) dey for ::A::, den if e rise (or if e fall) go still dey for ::B::”. As de talk wey dey point give wetin dey real (wey concern ::A:: and ::B:: say na situation wey dey real, na im be say), de validity wey e sopoz get, dem nor fit make am say e dey certain if dem look only de proposition or any other talk wey dem be bring where na from dere dem fit bring out one question with logic, but e go continue to be dem say dem say and e go come dey depend on wetin go come out for experiences wey dey front front wey dem nor fit know before dat time. If experience com later confirm de explanation wey be dem say dem say, that is if person com observe one kain situation wey e be say ::B:: com true true dey follow ::A:: as dem first predict am, dis one nor go come prove am say dat dem say dem say na true, since ::A:: and ::B:: na general, and language wey dem nor fit understand (“wey dey everywhere, wey different from wetin dey for proper names”) wey dey point give situation or event wey get (or, at least *might*, in principle be)and wey get plenty plenty examples and later, wetin people don experience nor fit prove am say na lie. And if say experience com fit show say one dem say dem say na lie, that is, if person com look well well com see say ::A:: wey ::B:: nor follow, dem nor go fit decide dis kain one to be e nor go still dey possible say situation wey still concern dem say dem say e true true dey connected and some kind circumstances or variable wey dem nor  fit control and wey dem don first comot before don come stop de relationship wey dem be don dey see for front front wey dem nor fit see am again. If we talk/show say na lie, e go only show say dat particular dem say dem say wey dem be dey investigate before nor be dey correct finish because as e be, dem need to do some kain refinement, some variables wey dem go add wey dey specific wey person go need to control if e wan fit see that relationship wey dey front front between ::A:: and ::B::. However, if we talk am say e nor correct no go fit ever prove am say de relationship wey go dey for some kain situation no even exist sef.[^16]

[^16]: Look Karl R. Popper, *The Logic of Scientific Discovery* (New York: Basic Books, 1959); idem, *Conjectures and Refutations* (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1969); Carl G. Hempel, *Aspects of Scientific Explanations* (New York: Free Press, 1970); Ernest Nagel, *The Structure of Science* (New York: Harcourt, Brace and World, 1961).

Last last, positivism com dey claim say all dese two principle wey relate with each oda, dem apply for everywhere, even com touch all de areas wey concern knowledge (de thesis wey concern “the unity of science”): E nor go get a priori knowledge wey concern nature or even de social reality wey concern wetin human being dey do and knowledge dey even exist; and de structure wey concern explanations for science na de same thing even if we remove mind for de subject matter.[^17]

[^17]: Look Paul Oppenheim and Hilary Putnam, “Unity of Science as a Working Hypothesis”, in H. Feigl, ed., *Minnesota Studies in the Philosophy of Science* (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1967), vol. 2.

Abysay dis tin wey we dey practice dey correct e go dey easy to tey recognize de implication wey dey relative. Ethics nor be discipline wey dem need to use brain put. Any kyn talk wey normal just be like, or e nor just get better foundation like dat oda one. But if we still look am, wetin dey wrong with everybody wey dey try to force put for anoda person body wetin im dey like? E nor get anything. Dem dey allow everything. Dem com reduce ethics to one question wey be “wetin I go fit escape?” which oda better message dem go fit tell all dose people wey dey up: for de king wey dey chop person, for person wey get slave, or for people wey dey inside government office! Na exactly wetin dem wan hear: e fit be and wetin go make am dey well.

For de same way, e go surprise dem say de message wey positivism dey carry wey concern sciences wey dey positive. For natural sciences, wetin positivist dem believe nor dey harm person. All those course wey concern logic and protophysics, wey wetin dem talk, everybody dey look am as say na a priori true (wey experience nor fit proof am say na lie), positivist com still explain am say e nor carry knowledge wey dey “real” at all, and e com be formalism wey dey empty empirically. Dis kind talk  com help spoil som kind part wey dey for maths and logic make e com be like games wey nor get meaning again, wey everybody wey dey outside nor go come know anything about de subject because e don already dey old.[^18] But e never change and e nor go fit change d fact say e get some kind talk wey dey for logic and maths  wey dem go fit use for natural sciences wey dey empirical, and so, dem com dey treat am like say e get some kain information wey dey empirical, but e nor go be like all dose hypothetical ones.[^19] Wahala no dey for too dey see the good things inside normal science, like physics. The ways, wey person no go fit differenciate truely if two or more things take dey, da one fit make person no mind wetin dey happen all around am but make him mind am business, although person fit dey blame bad things wey happen say na sake of say na because of something wey him no do before na him cause am. As e take be so, nobody dey wan do wetin him suppose do but go wan talk excuses wey make him for no do wetin him suppose do so that the blame no go dey for only him head.

[^18]: Look Kambartel, *Erfahrung und Struktur*, esp. pp. 236–42\. How rationalist tey dey look logic and mathematics, dem summarized am for Gottlob Frege’s dictum say “e dey follow wetin be de truth wey concern axioms, say dem nor dey contradict each other”. The positivist-formalist com interpret am for another way say, dem don formulate am by the young D. Hilbert: “If the axioms wey dem nor dey assume arbitrarily nor dey lead to implications wey dey contradictory, then na true, and the objects wey de axioms dey define really dey exist” (dem quote am from Kambartel, p. 239).

:::: The formalism wey deep well well com explains say Kambartel get consequences wey big well well.

::::> As maths take no dey be how person dey use make real excuse again, or wey person go reason wella, that one too dey very important now. As we take forget to dey reason good excuse and the normal way no too dey give better reason, na so e take better to dey take things as e take be. (p. 241)

:::: For wetin go com happen,

::::> Plenty solution wey dey ground already, na plaything give some people, but no be everybody sabi wetin dey ground, sake of dem no sabi where e be to talk say na here be plaything and na here be the real thing. (p. 238)

When we begin enter social science sha, na dere we say oda people actions dey reach oda people too, na sake of dis now person no go dey do anyhow, but go do wey suppose for dem oga on top.

Make we consider some kain talk wey dem talk concern economy: Anytime wey dem dey exchange somtin wey dem nor use free mind do, wey dem use force put, like all dose kind robbery wey dem dey do for highway or say dem dey collect tax for person hand, one person for wetin dem dey exchange go come gain am while de oda person nor go come gain anything. Or say: anytime wey dem wan enforce law wey concern minimum wage wey require say make wage rate big pass market wages wey din already dey exist, unemployment wey dem be nor plan for go come dey happen. Or say: anytime wey dem increase aw money tey plenty reach while dem nor come change aw people tey dey need money, the power wey money get to tey dey buy something go come fall. Or say: Any where wey money dey come from dey "come well well" wey as people tey dey live, changes nor go come dey wey better (and e go get effect wey dem go fit distribute). Or say: dem gather all de factors wey concern production, DAT one go come make am mey cost-accounting nor dey possible, and e go come lead to make the evaluations wey concern customers reduce well well. Or say: The tax wey dem dey give income producers com increase their effective time wey concern preference rate, and e go come lead to mey de goods wey dem dey produce come reduce well well. Na clear tin say, all dese talk wey dem dey talk get knowledge inside dem wey dey talk about wetin dey happen for real life, yet e noe be like say na wetin be lie but e com be say na true if we dey define am.[^20] However, if we dey look am for de side wey concern positivism, dis tin nor fit be like dat. For wetin we dey talk since, as dem dey claim am say na empirical statements wey get meaning, dem go be hypotheses wey dem go put under confirmation wey dey empirical or falsification. Person fit carry make wetin be de opposite of the kind talk wey we talk for up so and e nor go talk Anytin wey we go fit look say na dere dis thing for tey start, a priori, say na lie (and na nonsense). We go leave am for experience make e decide de matter. So if we wan assume all dose things wey positivist carry as doctrine Ehn, all dose people wey dey thief thief for road, dose ones wey dey collect tax, all dose people wey dey work follow union or dose Federal Reserve Board go dey do wetin correct if we dey look am from the science side, if we wan still claim say to dey collect tax dey benefit people wey dey pay de tax and e go still increase wetin dem dey produce, laws wey concern minimum wage go come increase employment, and to dey create all dis paper money go come dey being prosperity for every corner. As activist wey dey good, person go need agree say all dis one na just normal talk talk too. With de effect wey dem go fit predict if person dey good, however, dem sopoz put am into use and dey try am. After all, person nor sopoz to close e eye to som kain things wey new wey e never see before, and person go always dey willing to use mind wey nor strong and wey dey open to anything wey go come out from all dose kain experience. However, is wetin go happen nor go be like as dem say dem say, and people wey dem rob or people wey dem dey collect tax from dere hand nor dey show say dem dey benefit, employment go come reduce, or economic cycle instead of prosperity wey reach everybody hand go come dey happen, the possibility wey go dey if dem dey immunize wetin person be predict go come be real, almost action wey go dey tempt you well well wey dem nor go fit resist. Why e go come be say person wey dey thief thief, person wey dey collect tax abi na person wey dey Federal Reserve Board nor go wan dey play down every time all dose kain experience wey dey show say na lie as somtin wey just happen like dat, as far as say he go dey benefit on e own anytime wey e go rob-, go collect tax-, or any experience wey go fit bring in money? Why e nor go wan interpret all de things wey show say na lie and wey just dey clear say na na experience wey some kind circumstances wey dem neglect cause and wey go disappear and go com change to wetin dey opposite, wey go come reveal de true  friendship wey dey between taxes, minimum wage laws, to dey create money and prosperity once dem fit control all dis kain circumstances?

[^20]: Make you look dis two economic treaties wey dey front front wey concern dis our time: Mises’s *Human Action*, and Rothbard’s *Man, Economy, and State*.

In fact, any kain experience at all wey person bring tey fight all dis kind dem say dem say, as soon as person com accept positivism, com still reject de idea to tey form one kain case wey dey *principled* wey go support or wey nor go support am wey dem nor conceive with better mind, de person wey dey thief or de person wey dey collect tax, im case dey safe from criticism wey dey decisive because if de person fail at all, dem go talk say na variable wey just come wey dem nor fit control. Even de experiment wey de control dey perfect nor fit control dis kain situation. Because e nor go ever dey possible to tey control all de variables wey go fit change de variable wey we go explain or de result wey go come out. If we dey practice am, dis one go involve make make we dey control everything wey dey for de universe *wetin im be*. E nor get aw de charges wey dem bring wey arm robber commit wan be, even de person wey dey collect tax, or wey dey Federal Reserve Board, wey dey inside de positivist methodology, dem go always to fit dey preserve and to dey rescue de “main part” of de “research program” as Lakatos wey be neo-Popperian positivist go call am. Experience go only fit tell us say one kain experiment nor reach where e suppose to reach, but e nor go fit tell us if one wey just get small difference go fit produce result wey dey different, or if e dey possible to reach dat target wey concern prosperity wey go round by means of *any* kain thief thief, to dey collect tax or to dey make paper money.

De attitude wey people get wey concern positive economics say na positivism dey give power and na im com really be de characteristics wey all dis modern power elites and dere bodyguards wey nor too get brain na de same tin with social engineer wey be relativist wey e motto na “nothing wey dem go fit know wey get certainty say e nor go possible for de world wey concern social phenomenon and e nor get anything wey person nor go wan try out for e own fellow human being, as far as say e mind dey open”.[^21]

[^21]: Make you still look Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism* (Boston: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1989), chap. 6; idem, “The Intellectual Cover for Socialism”, *Free Market* (February 1988).

De fact say positivism dey support de mentality wey concern social relativism nor prove say e dey wrong. But all de suspect wey dem dey suspect wey concern weda e dey valid be like wetin dey appropriate. Na true thing be say e nor dey obvious say e nor suppose get ethical standard wey dey rational at all, and say for real “anything dey go”.  And nor be still somtin wey dey fast and valid say economics go either be symbolic game wey dey meaningless empirically (na system wey get propositions wy dem analyze), or na set of wetin be dem say dem say, and wetin dem predict wey dey empirically falsible wey concern wetin go come out from wetin humans dey do and de interactions wey dem dey get. For de case wey we first talk, na just waste of time, and for de economics wey we com later talk,  e go come dey obvious say na impotent something and e nor dey relevant (if na anything, de baker wey dey for old Athens for fit predict de behavior of e fellowman *e go do am well and e go do am with better confidence* pass de people wey dey do am nowadays!). However, all dose things wey dem talk wey concern economics like all dose ones wey dem mention for up na clear thing say e nor dey meaningless and e nor still dey irrelevant. Na true say if we dey look all de implications wey self-serving positivism for dose people wey dey power., dem fit suspect am well say dem go fit accept positivism even tho say nor be true, and e go fit still fit continue even tho say dem show say na lie – as e don dey like dat sef.

All de three talk wey concern positivism wey relate with each other na lie.[^22]

[^22]: Look all dese things, Mises, *The Ultimate Foundation of Economic Science*; Murray N. Rothbard, *Individualism and the Philosophy of the Social Sciences* (San Francisco: Cato, 1979); Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *Praxeology and Economic Science* (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988); idem, “On Praxeology and the Praxeological Foundations of Epistemology and Ethics”; also Martin Hollis and Edward Nell, *Rational Economic Man* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975), Introduction.

If e concern de way wey positivism tey classify well well de analytic, empirical, and emotive talk dem, person suppose ask: wetin go com be de state of dis axiom wey we dey talk? E go either be talk wey dey analytical or empirical, or e go be emotions wey dem dey show. If dem take am say e dey analytical, dem na talk wey be say dey empty, wey nor dey talk better thing of wetin dey real, but e just dey only define one kain sound or symbol with another one. Derefor, e go just raise e shoulder and talk say “ehen?” And dis kain answer go still dey nice if dem dey take de argument wey positivist dey talk say de talk still dey empirical. If na dat one be de case, dem go agree say dat kind talk fit still nor correct and say person go get right to tey know wetin really dey wey e go fit decide whether e dey or e nor dey. If we wan really talk am well,  as na talk wey dey empirical, e go fit just dey talk fact wey don dey history and so e nor go dey relevant if we wan determine whether e dey possible or e nor dey possible to tey bring out talk wey dey empirical and wey still be true, or normative and e nor go still carry emotions. Last last,if we dey  assume de way wey positivist tey dey reason say na propostion wey carry emotions, den according to dere own doctrine, common sense show say e nor get meaning and e nor get anything wey be true at all, and no need for person to pay attention to am like dog wey dey bark.

Derefor, person go need conclude from de beginning say positivism don fail patapata. E nor dey prove say ethics fit dey rational. And dem nor fit still consider am say na epistemology, or theory wey concern knowledge wey dey justifiable. Becox if e be like dat, den de main thing wey positivism dey talk go need to be talk wey be synthetic a priori (e go com be empirical and dem nor go fit talk say na lie), wey e existence, positivism nor gree. Derefor person go don see eself for rationalism wey dey social.

For wetin resemble, positivism dey talk say all explanations wey concern science na dem say dem say and e dey defeat e self. (wetin go com be de status of dis explanation?)[^23] Make we for tay see am, make we assume say explanation wey dey join two or more events dem don see am say e go fit for one set of data and dem go com apply am for de second data set, wey dem go assume say e go dey undergo empirical test wey go go far far. Now person suppose ask: Wetin go com be de presupposition wey dem go talk wey dem go fit tey relate de second experience with de one wey dem first talksay e dey confirm am or e dey talk say na lie? E go be like say for de second experience, wetin dem see for de first one com dey happen again and dis one go com be de confirmation and if nor be so, e go come be say na lie. E don clear say, de methodology wey positivist dem dey use, dey assume say dis kain thing dey obvious. But dis one nor com be true. Experience dey only show say two or more observations wey concern sequence wey nor long for two or more events , dem go fit classify am “neutrally” say e dey “repeat” or e “nor dey repeat”. Repetition wey dey neutral go only fit be “positive” confirmation and de one wey nor dey repeat go com bbe “negative” lie lie if e com show say e dey independent of wetin dem discover by experience, dem go com assume say e get constant, operating causes wey be time-invariant. If e nor com correspond with dis thing, dem go come assume say all dose things wey dey happen in de course of time go fit dey operate one kain way dis time and anoda kain way for anoda time, den all dis occurrences wey dey repeat eself and de one wey nor dey repeat eself go com be simple experience wey dem don register wey go still dey neutral, wey e go just dey on e own completely. E nor get any way wey dem tey relate with each other logically say na wetin go talk say na true or wetin go talk say na lie. E get one experience and another one still dey, dem be de same thing or dem nor be de same thing, but na everything wey concern am be dat; and anoda thing nor dey.

[^23]: Just look all dis ones too Hoppe, *Kritik der kausalwissenschaftlichen Sozialforschung*; still look supra chap. 7.

Derefor, de kain talk wey be say go fit talk say “na lie” or talk say “na true” na de constancy principle: de kind mind wey nor fit shake wey be say all dose phenomena wey dem dey observe say na principle wey causes wey dey constant dey determine and e nor concern time de way wey dem tey dey operate. Only if say dem assume say constancy principle dey valid na im e go com follow any failure wey dem nor go fit reproduce result wey go show say somtin dey wrong with de original hypothesis; and na only dat way dem fit tey interpret successful reproduction say na true. E don clear say, dis constancy principle nor carry experience and dem nor bring am come out too from experience. E nor just be only say e nor get link wey dey connect events, but even tho say all dose kain link dey exist, experience nor go fit show whether e nor depend on time or e depend on time. And experience too nor go fit talk say de theory na lie, since anything wey go wan show say e go fit show sayna lie (like if dem nor photocopy some kain results) dem go interpret am from de beginning say if experience don show before say na just one *particular* type of event nor be im cause another one. However, e com reach de extent say experience nor fit comot de possibility say *another* set of events, say dem go fit see am wey go come be like say e nor dey depend on time for de way wey e tey dey operate, so de one wey be say dem say constancy principle dey valid, another person/thing nor go come fit com talk say na lie.

Bad as bad, even tho say dem nor dey derive am from and experience nor fit still talk say na lie, de constancy principle nor be anything wey dey less than presupposition wey dey necessary logically wey concern experience wey dem go fit talk say e dey agree with each other or e nor dey agree with each other (wey nor gree with experiences wey dey isolated and wey nor connect with each other logically). Derefor, since positivism dey assume say all dose experiences wey dey logically related dey exist, we go must conclude am say e dey also assume say all dose knowledge wey be nonhypothetical wey concern reality still dey exist too. We go must still assume say e really get causes wey nor dey depend on time. And dem go still assume say na dis one be de case even tho say experience nor go fit talk weda na true or nor be true. If we wan still talk am again, positivism com show say e nor dey consistent and na philosophy wey dey contradict eself. E get explanations wey nor be hypothetical wey dey explain som kain things wey dey real.

Last last (by dis kain time, e nor go dey surprise us again), wetin positivist dem dey talk wey concern unity of science com be say e dey contradict eself. Positivism dey claim say  actions just like any other thing wey dey happen, dem go fit explain am by de means of dem say dem say wey dem go fit still fit talk say na true or talk say na lie by experience. If dis one com be de case, den e nor go com follow wetin be de doctrine wey talk say e nor go get a priori knowledge wey concern reality. Dem go com force positivism make e assume say operating causes wey nor depend on time with respect to wetin person go do dey exist. Make we for proceed as positivism want make we proceed – make we dey relate different experiences wey concern events wey just dey happen say either dem dey confirm each other or dem dey talk say na lie – wetin com dey constant for time wey long wey concern aw dem tey dey operate causes, we go com dey suppose say (as dem don first explain am before). However, if dis kain thing na true, and true true say dem fit conceive actions as dem tey talk am for operating causes wey nor depend on time, den what of to come dey explain de people wey dey explain, dat is dose people wey dey do de process wey concern how dem tey dey create hypothesis, or to talk say na true, or to talk say na lie; everybody that is dose people wey dey act de way wey positivist tey dey tell us make we act. As e clear so, make we for fit do everything, to tey assimilate experiences wey dey talk say na true or de one wey dey talk say na lie, dem go come dey replace all dose experiences wey don old with de one wey dey new – person must to dey ready to dey learn. However, if person fit dey learn from wetin don pass, and dem com dey force positivist make dem talk say this kain thing na true, den person nor go fit know for one particular time wetin e go for know later and how person go tey act base on wetin e don know. Instead, person go only fit construct again wetin dey cause how person go react afta somtin don happen, since person go only fit explain wetin im know after e don already dey possess am. Derefor, if we dey apply de method wey concern positivist for de area wey concern wetin person know and how person tey dey act, wey still contain knowledge as one kain ingredient wey dey very important, na say e just dey contradict eself – and na logic wey just dey one kain.

Dem go fit assume say de constancy principle wey concern natural objects dat is, for some kain situation wey *nor* dey constituted by wetin person know or how person tey dey act wey dey show dat kain knowledge (for dis kain situation, de question wey dey ask whether e get some kain constants wey na de law dey govern base on say e go dey possible to tey make prediction wey dey *exante* go com dey determined positively wey nor go dey dependent on experience, and empirical factors dey play one kain role wey dey only determine which variable dey concrete wey dey casually linked to variiables wey get concrete effects, and wey nor be so). With wetin concern wetin we know and how we tey dey act, for de other way, de constancy principle nor go dey valid (if we dey look am from de kain situation wey de question wey be whether constants dey or e nor dey, dey empirical for e own nature and dem go only fit decide am for variable wey dem don already give wey dey based on experience wey don pass, dat is, *before before post*). And all dis kain things, wey be wetin person know about wetin dey real, dem go fit know am apodictically. Derefor, one kain methodology *wey dey two* rather dan de positivist own wey be only one, dem go must accept am and agree say na a priori true.
