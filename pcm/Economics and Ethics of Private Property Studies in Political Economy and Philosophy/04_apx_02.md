###  Utilitarians and Randians vs. Reason 

[^0]: Reply to “Symposium on Hoppe’s Argumentation Ethic”, *Liberty* (November 1988).

E dey neither possible nor e dey worthwhile to dey address every points dem carry com up for de talk way dey ground for here. I go concentrate on dose critics way com out more vehemently against watin I dey argue – all of dem utilitarians of sort. I go den com talk small on de Randian type of reaction.

De thing dey surprisingly, Friedman, Yeager, Steel, Waters, VirKKala, and Jones com believe say I don overlooked de matter warin dey ground dat all warin dey exit for where people dey live com dey small pass plenty libertarian (dat slavery dey, de gulag, or dat married man get wives, etc.), and dat dis somehow invalidates warin I dey argue about. Obviously, I com hardly write dis articles if e come be my opinion dat libertarianism com get ready prevalent. Ehen, e come dey clear dat it was precisely dis nonlibertarian behavior of things way dey real which com jimjam me up to come show me something way dey quite different: why dis level of affair no go fit be *justified*. Citing matter way dey like people way be slave for counter-for example na roughly on top of par with refuting dey proof dat ::1+1=2:: by de pointing out dat somebody don come up with 3 as de answer – and about as ridiculous.

 To restate me make I cool down: whether or not something na true, lie, or undecidable; whether or not dey done justified am;  warin dey come dey required in other to come justify it; whether na me, my opponents, or none of us dey correct – all of dis one must come be decided inside de course of de arguementation. Dis proposition na true a priori, becos e no go fit be denied without affirming it inside de act of denying am. No one go if argue dat one no go fit argue, and no one go fit dispute am come know dat it means to come dey raise a validity claim without implicitly claiming at least de negative of dis proposition na true e be.     

Dis one be dey called “de a priori of argumentation”, and na becos of de axiomatic status of dis proposition, analogous to de “action axiom” of praxeology, dat I come invoked Mises inside my own artice. (Virkkala’s come outrage over disqualifies for himself becos I come explicitly talked say dat Mises though dat warin I dey try to do no go fit be impossible. Moreover, na warin e understand of Mises dat na amusing. While e come dey true dat praxeology come talk *about* marginalism, e come dey obviously not de case dat  praxeology which e be body of propositions e no day any way come affected by marginal choices. Praxeology come have universally true propositions, and weather or not we like or agree  to collect dem no go fit affect dis at all. E come dey beyond me why dat any different com go dey when e come to ethical propositions. Virkkala go fit just attack Mises for a “retreat from marginalism” becos e dey claim dat praxeology na *true*.)          

With de a priori of argumentation way dey ground as an axiomatic come starting point, e come follows dat anything dat way must be presupposed in de act of proposition-making no go fit be propositionally disputed again. E no go get meaning to come dey ask for a justification of presuppositions which come make de production come dey meaningful propositions possible inside de first place. Instead, dey go must regard dem as ultimately justified by all dose way dey make proposition maker. Any specific propositional content way come argue dere real validity dem go fit understand am as implying a performative contradiction (warin come explained by David Gordon), and from today go up, as dey ultimately falsified.

De law way dey for contradiction na one way be presupposition. One no go fit deny say dat dis law  without presupposing go dey validity in de act of come denying it. But e come get anoder such presupposition. Propositions nor be freefloating something. Dey come require dose people who dey make proposition maker who go produce any validity com dey claiming proposition in a way dat dey must come get exclusive control (property) over something way come get scare means come defined inside de objective terms and appropriated (come dey under control) at warin come get definite points in time through dem homesteading action. Ehen, any proposition way go come dispute de validity of de homesteading way get principle acquisition or dat way go assert de validity of a different  principle way no fit be de same principle go dey falsified by de act by dose proposition making way go come be de same with de proposition “de law of contradiction na lie” go come dey contradicted by de very fact of asserting it. As de praxeological presupposition of dose who be de proposition making, de validity of de homesteading principle no go fit be argumentatively come disputed as dey come dey run into a performative contradiction. Any other principle way property acquisition come get go fit com be understood – reflectively – by every one way dey make proposition as de ultimately incapable of de propositional justification. (Note, in particular, dat dis come includes all proposals which come claim it is justified to restrict de range of objects which may come be homesteaded. Dey come fail becos once de exclusive control over *some* homesteaded which com means to admitted as justified, e no come become possible to take justify any restriction inside de homesteading process – except warin dem take put by force inside one – without thereby no come run into a contradiction. For if de proponent of warin dey restriction were consistent, he for come justified control only over some of de physical means which dem for no allow am to employ for any extra homesteading. Obviously, he no fit interfere with anoder’s extended homesteading simply becos for him own lack of physical means way he take to do anything about it justifiably. But if him come do interfere, he for thereby inconsistently make his own ownership claims beyond *his* own justly homesteaded means. Moreover if him want justify dis extension he for come invoke a principle of property acquisition way no dey compatible with de homesteading principle whose validity he for just already come admitted.) 

Warin I dey argue for, and then, come be like say e no dey possible with proof. E no dey, as dey come mentioned critics seem to think, a proof dat come means to take show de impossibility of certain empirical warin dey happen so dat dey come refuted by empirical evidence. Instead, e come be proof dat e no come dey possible  to justify nonlibertarian property principles propositionally without com fall into contradictions. Whatever such thing come get value (and I go com to dis shortly), e go come dey clear dat empirical evidence has absolutely no come get bearing on it. So what if dem come get people way be slave, de gulag, taxation? De proof way come concerns de issue be dat come dey claim say such institutions go fit be justified go come involve a performative contradiction. Na purely intellectual e come be for nature, like logical, mathematical, or praxeological proofs. him validity, like dem own, go fit be established on him own of any contingent experiences. Nor e fit be validity in any way make e go fit affect, as plenty critics – most notoriously Waters – fit dey think, by whether or not people like am, favor, understand, or come for consensus regarding it, or whether or not dey come dey actually engaged  in argumentation. 

Since dem com get consideration way dey irrelevant in order to come judge de validity of a mathematical proof, for instance, so dem come dey beside de point here. In de same way as de validity of a mathematical proof e no dey restricted to de moment to come proof am, so dat na de validity of de libertarian property theory no come limited to instances of argumentation. If I correct, de argument come demonstrates its universal justification. (Of all de utilitarian critics only Steele takes up de challenges dat I come posed for them: dat de assignment way get property rights no go fit  be dependent on any later outcome becos for dis case no one forever know before de outcome how him be or how e no dey justify to do; and dat to dey  advocating a consequentialist position utilitarianism na [strictly speaking] no ethic at all if e come fails to answer de all decisive question “warin I fit justified to do now”? Steele go fit solves dis problem for de same way as he dey proceeds throughout his talk: by misunderstanding warin e be. He come misconceives my argument as subject to come do empirical testing and come misrepresents it  as him dey claim to show dat “I come dey do favor to libertarian ethic” follows from “I come dey claim such and such to be valid, i.e., na capable of propositional justification”. Him come talk back say consequentialist problem na yet anoder stroke of genius: No, says Steele, consequentialism no go involve a praxeologically absurd way dey wait for de outcome ethic. His example: Some rules come dey advocated first, then come implemented, and later adjusted warin depend on de outcomes. While dis na  indeed an example of consequentialism, I come fail to see how e go provide an answer to “warin we dey justified in doing now”? and so warin come escape de absurdities of a waiting go later come out for de ethic. De starting point na unjustified [Which rules? Not only de outcome come depend on dis!]; and de consequentialist procedure na unjustified, too. [Why not to follow de rules and come dey do dem regardless of warin go come out?] Steele’s answer to for de question “warin am I justified in doing”? na “dat depends on warin ever rules you come start up with, then for de outcome of warin ever dis lead go bring, and  finally on whether or not you come care about warin de outcome go be”. Warin ever dis be, no be ethic.)

De reaction way de for de other Randian side, come represented by Rasmussen, na different. Him get fewer difficulties recognizing de nature of my argument but then he come ask me in turn “So warin? Why should an a priori come dey proof of de libertarian property theory come make any different? Why you no come engage in aggression anyway”? Why indeed?! But then, why should de proof dat ::1+1=2:: e come make any different? One go fit certainly can still act on de belief dat ::1+1=3::. De obvious answer na “becos a propositional justification come dey exist for just one thing, but nor be for dey do anoder”. But warin go make us dey reasonable, na de next comeback. Again, de answer na obvious. For one, becos e go dey impossible to argue against it; and further, becos de proponent way de raise dis  question come already affirm de use of reason in his act of questioning it. Dis still go fit not suffice and everyone go know dat it would not, for even if de libertarian ethic and argumentative come dey reasoning must be regarded as ultimately justified, dis still no fit preclude dat people go still act on de basic of unjustified beliefs either becos dey no know, dey know care, or dey no agree to know. I come fail to see why dis come be surprise or make de proof somehow to defective. More than dis no go fit do by propositional argument.  

Rasmussen come dey think say if I come get am “ought” way I get am for somewhere (something dat Yeagerclaims I dey try to do though I explicitly come denied dis), then things go come improved. But dis na simply an illusory hope. For even if Rasmussen come dey prove dat de proposition dat one *ought* to come be reasonable and *ought* to come dey act according to de libertarian property ethic, dis go come just be anoder propositional argument. E no go fit say dat people go dey do warin dey ough to do than warin I  proof go fit quarantee dat dem go do warin dey justified. Where de different come dey, and warin na all de fuss about? Dere is and remains a different between come establishing a truth come claim and come dey instilling a desire to dey act upon de truth – with “ought” or without it. E go dey surely great if a proof go fit make dis thing happen. But even e no happen, dis can hardly dey against am. E also no go fit subtract anything from its merit if in some or even for many cases a small raw utilitarian assertions prove to dey more successful in persuading anyone of libertarianism than warin e go fit do. A proof na still a proof and social psychology na still social psychology.
