#### Ang Proseso sa Pagkakapitalista

Ganyan ang isang sentensiya ay nanatiliparin sa mga paghahanap ng maraming suporta kung ang teorya ni Keynes sa proseso ng kapitalista ay isinasaalang-alang. Na si Keynes ay walang kaibigan ng kapitalismo at kapitalista ay dapat na halata mula sa mga sipi sa itaas. Sa katunayan, sa pamamagitan ng pagtataguyod ng "isang pagsasapanlipunan ng pamumuhunan" lumabas siya nang hayagan bilang isang sosyalista.[^67] Para sa Keynes, ang kapitalismo ay nangangahulugang krisis.

[^67]: Ang sosyalismong Keynes, ganunpaman, ay hindi ang kapantay ng-prolitaryayn ng bilang bersyon ng pag-aasawa ng mga Bolsheviks. 
Para sa Keynes na ito ay walang anuman kundi paghamak. Ang kanyang sosyalismo ay sa iba't ibang pasista o Nazi. Sa paunang salita sa Aleman na edisyon ng kanyang Pangkalahatang Teorya (na lumitaw sa huling bahagi ng taong 1936) sumulat siya:

::::> Ang teorya ng kabuuang produksyon na ang layunin nsa sumusunod na aklat ay maaaring mas madaling maipapataw sa mga kondisyon ng 
isang pagiging estado kaysa sa teorya ng produksyon at pamamahagi ng isang ibinigay na output na nakabukas sa ilalim ng mga kondisyon ng 
malayang kumpetisyon at ng isang malaki antas ng laissez-faire. (sinipi mula sa Hazlitt, Ang Kabiguan ng "Bagong Ekonomika," p. 277)

Kinikilala niya ang mahahalaga na dalawang dahilan para dito, ang una, na kung saan ang katangian ni Keynes ay ang paiko-ikot na katangian sa prosesong kapitalista, ay naantig na. Sigurado, hangga't ang kurso ng ekonomiya ay higit na natutukoy ng mga kapitalista na, tulad ng aming narinig, "ay hindi gaanong nalalaman kung ano ang kanilang binibili," at nagsabwatan "upang mapanatili ang mga bagay na mahirap makuha," hindi ito maaaring maging isang makinis at kahit na isa. Depende sa karamihan sa mga taong nagbabatay sa kanilang mga desisyon sa kanilang "panunaw at lagay ng panahon," ang proseso ng kapitalista ay dapat na mali-mali. Inilipat ng "waksing at waning" ng optismong negosyo at pesimismo, na kung saan ay tinutukoy ng "hindi mapigilan at masuwayin na sikolohiya ng mundo ng negosyo," ang mga pintog sa mga dibdib ay hindi maiiwasan. Ang mga kurso ng pagnenegosyo-kaya ang sentral na mensahe ng kabanata 22 ng 
Pangkalahatang Teorya ni Keynes, ang "Mga Tala sa Siklo ng Palitan" -ang mga saykolohikal na determinadong kababalaghan. Ito ay tiyak na hindi tama. Ang sikolohikal na paliwanag ng siklo ng negosyo ay mahigpit na imposible, at ang pag-iisip na ito bilang isang paliwanag ay nagsasangkot ng pagkakamali ng kategorya: Ang mga kurso ng negosyo ay malinaw na tunay na mga pangyayari, nakaranas ng mga indibidwal, ngunit nakaranas ng mga ito na nangyayari sa labas ng mga ito sa mundo ng mga tunay na kalakal at tunay na kayamanan. Ang mga paniniwala, 	sentimyento,  pagmimithi, optimismo, at pesimismo sa kabilang panig ay mga sikolohikal na kababalaghan. Ang isa ay maaaring mag-isip ng isang sikolohikal na hindi pangkaraniwang bagay na nakakaapekto o nakakaimpluwensya sa isa pa, ngunit imposibleng maisip ang isang sikolohikal na kababalaghan na may anumang direktang epekto sa mga kinalabasan sa labas ng mundo ng mga tunay na bagay at mga kalakal. Sa pamamagitan lamang ng mga aksyon ay maaaring maimpluwensyahan ang kurso ng mga tunay na pangyayari; at anumang paliwanag tungkol sa ikot ng negosyo pagkatapos ay dapat na maging isang presilohikal (kumpara sa isang sikolohikal) isa. Ang sikolohiyang sikolohikal na ikot ng negosyo ni Keynes sa katunayan ay hindi maaaring ipaliwanag na ang anumang bagay ay tunay na nangyayari sa lahat. Ganunpaman, tulad ng mga tunay na bagay na ginawa upang mangyari ang mga tao ay dapat kumilos, at ilaan at muling ibalik ang mga mapagkukunan ng mga mapagkukunan upang mapahalagahan ang mga layunin. Ang isa ay hindi maaaring kumilos bilang arbitraryo, ganunpaman, tulad ng gagawin ni Keynes, sapagkat sa pagkilos ng isa ay palaging napipigilan ng tunay na kakulangan na hindi maaapektuhan ng ating sikolohiya. Hindi rin ipinaliliwanag ni Keynes sa kanyang teorya kung bakit ang pang-nenegosyo na kampay-na kalooban ay magreresulta sa anumang partikular na pamamaraan ng pagbabagu-bago ng negosyo-tulad ng siklo ng pagpintog ng-dibdib, na gusto niyang ipaliwanag-sa halip na anumang iba pang nalalapit na pamamaraan ng mga pagbabago-bago.

Ang ikalawang dahilan para sa kawalang-katatagan ng kapitalismo, at ang kagustohan ng isang sosyalistang solusyon, ayon kay Keynes, 
ay ang likas na pagkilos ng pagkapigil ng kapitalismo. Ang teorya ng kanyang pagwawalang-kilos ay nakatuon sa paligid ng paniwala na 
kinuha niya mula sa Hobson at Mummery, at itinataguyod, "na sa karaniwan na kalagayan ng mga modernong pang-industriya na komunidad, 
ang limitasyon ng produksyon ay hindi limitado sa produksyon at hindi pagkonsumo ng produksyon."[^68] Gamit ito bilang isa sa 
kanyang mga batlain lamang Ang mga bagay na walang kabuluhan ay maaaring sundin.

Hanson, *Fiscal Policy and Business Cycles* (New York: Norton, 1941); for a critique see George Terborgh, *The Bogey of Economic Maturity* (Chicago: Machinery and Allied Products Institute, 1945); also Murray N. Rothbard, “Breaking Out of the Walrasian Box: The Cases of Schumpeter and Hansen”, *Review of Austrian Economics* 1 (1987).

Stagnation is due to a lack of consumption. “Up to the point where full employment prevails”, he writes, “the growth of capital depends not at all on a low propensity to consume but is, on the contrary, held back by it”.[^69] Combined with this underconsumptionist thesis is a “fundamental psychological law, upon which we are entitled to depend with great confidence both a priori from our knowledge of human nature and from the detailed facts of experience, that men are disposed, as a rule and on the average, to increase their consumption as their income rises, but not by as much as the increase in their income”.[^70] “As a rule … a greater proportion of income [will be] saved as real income increases”.[^71]

[^69]: Keynes, *The General Theory*, pp. 372–73.

[^70]: Ibid., p. 96.

[^71]: Ibid., p. 97; also pp. 27f.

On its own, this second law, which is accepted as plausible here for the sake of argument (except for adding that consumption can, of course, never fall to zero), would not seem to indicate any trouble. So what? If savings overproportionally increase with increasing incomes, so much the better for the social product.[^72] But Keynes, in his characteristic logic-carefree way of thinking joins this law to the thesis that production is limited by consumption, and he has then no difficulty proving whatever he wishes.


[^72]: In fact, Keynes informs us that *savings is by definition identical to investment* (p. 63), “that the excess of income over consumption, which we call saving, cannot differ from the addition to capital equipment which we call investment” (p. 64). Then, however, a reduced proportion of consumption expenditures must by definition go hand in hand with accordingly increased investments, and this would lead to a higher future income, to still more absolute consumption and still more absolute and relative saving and investment. Where, indeed, is the problem here?

If consumption limits production, and if nonconsumption rises with rising incomes, then it indeed seems to follow that increasing incomes imply their own undoing by increasing nonconsumption, which in turn limits production, etc. And if this is so, it also seems to follow that wealthier societies, which non-consume more, should be plagued particularly hard by this “stagnitis”; and that in any given society it should be the rich, who nonconsume more, who contribute most to economic stagnation (except for the “minor” problem that one cannot explain, according to this theory, why individuals or societies could be wealthier than others in the first place!). In any case, Keynes accepts these conclusions as true.[^73] Accordingly, he presents his recommendations on how to get out of stagnation. In addition to a “comprehensive socialization of investment”, Keynes suggests measures to stimulate consumption, in particular an income redistribution from the rich (people with a low propensity to consume) to the poor (those with a high propensity to consume).

[^73]: Keynes writes,

::::> If in a potentially wealthy community the inducement to invest is weak, then, in spite of its potential wealth, the working of the principle of effective demand will compel it to reduce its actual output, until, in spite of its potential wealth, it has become so poor that its surplus over its consumption is sufficiently diminished to correspond to the weakness of the inducement to invest. (*The General Theory*, p. 31)

::::Or:

::::> The greater, moreover, the consumption for which we have provided in advance, the more difficult it is to find something further to provide for in advance, and the greater our dependence on present consumption as a source of demand. Yet the larger our incomes, the greater, unfortunately, is the margin between our incomes and our consumption. So, failing some novel expedient, there is, as we shall see, no answer to the riddle, except that there must be sufficient unemployment to keep us so poor that our consumption falls short of our income by no more than the equivalent of the physical provision for future consumption which it pays to produce to-day. (p. 105)


> Whilst aiming at a socially controlled rate of investment with a view to a progressive decline in the marginal efficiency of capital I should support at the same time all sorts of policies for increasing the propensity to consume. For it is unlikely that full employment can be maintained, whatever we may do about investment, with the existing propensity to consume. There is room, therefore, for both policies to operate together;—to promote investment and, at the same time, to promote consumption, not merely to the level which with the existing propensity to consume would correspond to the increased investment, but to a higher level still.[^74]


[^74]: Ibid., p. 325; or “the remedy would lie in various measures designed to increase the propensity to consume by the redistribution of incomes or otherwise” (p. 324).

How is such a thing as simultaneously promoting investment and consumption in order to increase income conceivably possible? In fact, Keynes gives us his own formal definitions of the terms involved: “income = consumption + investment; saving = income - consumption; therefore, saving = investment”.[^75] Under these definitions, a simultaneous increase in consumption and investment out of a given income is conceptually impossible!

[^75]: Ibid., p. 63\. It is typical of Keynes’s philosophy of abundance that he gets things upside down here as well. For the correct definitions are: product produced = income; income - consumption = saving; saving = investment. Where does Keynes’s income come from?

Keynes is not terribly disturbed over “details” such as these. In order to get what he wants, he simply shifts, completely unnoted, the meanings of his terms. He drops the just quoted formal definitions, which would render such a result impossible, and he adopts a new meaning for the term saving. Instead of unconsumed income, saving quietly comes to mean hoarding (i.e., the act of not-spending money on *either* consumer *or* capital goods).[^76] Thereby the results can be easily made to come out right. For then savings are no longer equal to investment; and saving, being defined as the act of *not*-spending, automatically acquires a negative connotation, while investment and consumption take on a positive one. Moreover, now one must almost naturally be worried about savings exceeding investment, or so it seems, for this would seem to imply that something is leaking out of the economy, and that income (defined as investment + consumption) must be somehow reduced. Keynes certainly worries about this possibility. He calls it “a chronic tendency throughout human history for the propensity to save to be stronger than the inducement to invest”.[^77] And this chronic tendency must surely be particularly pronounced if incomes are high, for then, as we have been told, savings reach a particularly high proportion of income. But do not despair. Where something can leak out, something also can leak in. If savings is unspent money, then savings can be brought into existence, simple enough, by means of governmental money creation, so as to compensate for the outward leakage which tends to increase with increasing incomes. There is the danger, of course, that these compensatory “community savings” immediately leak out again by being added to the private sector’s cash hoardings (because, according to Keynes, the newly created savings would lower the interest rate, and this in turn would increase the capitalists’ liquidity preference so as to counteract such a tendency and to artificially “keep capital scarce”). But this can be taken care of by the “socialization of investment” as we know, and by some Gesellian stamped money schemes (“The idea behind stamped money is sound”).[^78] And once saving and investing is done publicly—through the agency of the State, as Keynes would say—and all money is spent, and no keep-things-scarce motive is in the way any longer, there is indeed no longer any problem with increasing consumption and investment simultaneously. Since savings is unspent money, and newly created money and credit is just as genuine as any other because it is not “forced” on anyone, savings can be created by the stroke of a pen.[^79] And since the State, contrary to the scarcity-exploiting capitalists, can make sure that these additional genuine savings are indeed being spent (instead of wandering into hoards), any increase in the supply of money and credit through governmental counterfeiting increases consumption and investment at the same time and so promotes income twice. Permanent inflation is Keynes’s cure-all. It helps overcome stagnation; and more of it overcomes the more severe stagnation crises of the more advanced societies. And once stagnation is defeated, still more inflation will abolish scarcity within one generation.[^80]

[^80]: On his program of permanent inflation see also this remark on the trade cycle: “The right remedy for the trade cycle is not to be found in abolishing booms and keeping us permanently in a semi-slump; but in abolishing slumps and thus keeping us permanently in a quasi-boom” (p. 322). The answer to credit expansion, that is, is still more credit expansion.

Yet the wonders do not cease. What is this leakage, this surplus of savings over investment, that constitutes all such dangers? Something must leak from somewhere to someplace else, and it must play some role here and some there. Keynes tries to disperse such thoughts by asking us once again not to apply logic to economics. “Contemporary thought”, he writes, “is still deeply steeped in the notion that if people do not spend their money in one way they will spend it in another”.[^81] It would seem hard to imagine how this contemporary thought could possibly be wrong, but Keynes believes it false. For him there exists a third alternative. Something, an economic good one would think, simply drops out of existence, and this means trouble.


[^81]: Ibid., p. 20.

> An act of individual saving means—so to speak—a decision not to have dinner to-day. But it does *not* necessitate a decision to have dinner or buy a pair of boots a week hence or a year hence or to consume any specified thing at any specified date. Thus it depresses the business of preparing to-day’s dinner without stimulating the business of making ready for some future act of consumption. It is not a substitution of future consumption-demand for present consumption-demand—it is a net *diminution* of such demand.[^82]

[^82]: Ibid., p. 210; second emphasis added.

Still, the strictures of a two-valued logic do not quite crumble yet. How can there be any net diminution of something? What is not spent on consumer goods or capital goods must still be spent on something else—namely on cash. *This exhausts all possibilities*. Income and wealth can be and must be allocated to consumption, investment, or cash. Keynes’s diminution, the leakage, the excess of savings over investment, is income spent on, or added to, cash hoardings. But such an increase in the demand for cash has no effect on income, consumption, and investment whatever, as has already been explained. With the social money stock being given, a general increase in the demand for cash can only be brought about by bidding down the money prices of nonmoney goods. But so what?[^83] Nominal income (i.e., income in terms of money) will fall; but real income and the real consumption-investment proportion will be entirely unchanged. And people along the way get what they want: an increase in the real value of their cash balances, and of the purchasing power of the money unit. There is nothing stagnating here, or draining, or leaking, and Keynes has offered *no theory of stagnation at all* (and with this, of course, also no theory of how to get out of stagnation). He merely has given a perfectly normal phenomenon such as falling prices (caused by an increased demand for money, or by an expanding productive economy) a bad name in calling it stagnation, or depression, or the result of a lacking effective demand, so as to find just another excuse for his own inflationary schemes.[^84]

[^83]: Contrary to Keynes’s fanciful fears, the demand for money can never be infinite, because everyone must obviously consume sometimes (and cannot delay consumption further); and at such points liquidity preference is definitely finite.

[^84]: The second element of Keynes’s stagnation theory is equally false. It may be that that saving in the definition of equaling investment increases overproportionally with increasing incomes—while it can never reach 100 percent. Yet this situation certainly should give no one concern regarding the social income produced. It is, however, *not* true that savings in the sense of hoarding increases with increasing incomes, and that the greatest leakage then occurs among the rich and in wealthy societies. The opposite is true. If real income increases because the economy, supported by additional savings, is expanding, the purchasing power of money increases (the money stock being given). But at a higher purchasing power of the money unit, the amount of cash demanded actually falls (the demand for money schedule being given). Thus, if anything, the leakstagnation nonproblem should actually diminish rather than increase with increasing wealth.

Here we have Keynes in his entire greatness: the twentieth century’s most famous “economist”. Out of false theories of employment, money, and interest, he has distilled a fantastically wrong theory of capitalism and of a socialist paradise erected out of paper money.
