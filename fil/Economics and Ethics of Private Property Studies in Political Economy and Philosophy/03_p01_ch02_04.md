Pagkatapos ng pagbagsak ng imperyong Romano, ang kanluraning Europa ay unti-unting nahulog sa mataas na sistema ng anarkiya ng mga teritoryong sinasakupan at pinamumunuan ng maliit na sukat ng mga pyudal na pamahalaan. Ito ay pinapangunahan ng internasyonal na anarkiya na siyang nagpapahina ng panloob na kapangyarihan sa bawat indibidwal na pamahalaan at nagpapagaan sa kilusan ng populasyon, [^27] at napapalago gamit ang ideolohiya ng likas na batas at karapatan, na syang lumitaw bilang pagtaas o paglakas ng teorya sa loob ng Simbahang Katoliko ng mga piling intelektwal na tao, walang duda na ang natural na pag-iisip ng tao tungkol sa pribadong ari-arian na dapat ay tugma sa likas na pagiging makatuwiran ng tao bilang epekto nito.[^28] Ang mga pinaunlad na malilit na sentro kung saan ang kapangyarihan ng pamahalaan ay tinaggal palayo sa antas ng mga unang hindi kilala: Ang mga lungsod sa Hilagang Italya, ang Venice na pinaka-kapansin-pansin sa lahat, ang mga "Hanseatic League" tulad ng Lübeck at Hamburg, at sa mga Flanders at mga bansa sa baba, partikular na sa Antwerp at Amsterdam. Doon, ang mga pyudal na ideya ng pagkaalipin, ng pagsisilbi, at ng hirarkiya na humahati sa lipunan ng hindi mababaling hiwa-hiwalay na klase na pinalitan ng opinyon ng publiko na sa halip ay suportahan ang kalayaan, pagkakapantay-pantay, karapatan sa pag-aari, at mga ugnayan ng pangongontrata. Ang opinyon ng publikong ito na matatag na nakakuha ng pwersa kasama ang patuloy na paglaki ng bagong populasyon, hango sa parehong ideya at nahikayat gamit ang pagtatanggal karapatan sa kasaganaan na ang kalayaan ay kayang patunayan na may kakayahan itong magawa sa kanyang sarili. [^29]

[^27]: Ang kahalagahan ng internasyonal na anarkiya para sa pagbagsak ng pyudalismo at ang pagbangon ng kapitalismo ay makatuwirang binigyan-diin ni Jean Baechler, sa kanyang akda na *The Origins of Capitalism* (New York: St. Martin’s Press, 1976), esp. chap. 7\. Kanyang isinulat: "Ang patuloy na paglawak ng merkado, ay parehong pinalaki at pinalakas, ay resulta ng kawalan ng batas ng pulitika na pinalaganap sa buong bahagi ng Kanlurang Europa (p. 73). "Ang paglawak ng kapitalismo ay utang nito sa kanyang sariling pinagmulan at *raison d’etre* sa pulitikal na anarkiya….Ang kolektibismo at estado ng pamamahala ay nagtagumpay lamang sa pampaaralang libro.

    > Ang lahat ng kapangyarihan na nakalaan para bigyang kaganapan. Kung ito'y 'di mangyayari, ito ay dahil sa ilang uri ng mga limitasyon na pinapatupad…. sa mga may posisyon sa kapangyarihan sa gitna ng walang humpay na pagsubok na pagbagsakin ang mga limitasyon na ito. Kailanman, sila ay 'di magtatagumpay, at para sa dahilan na ani mo'y nakatali na sa internasyonal na sistema: ang hangganan ng lakas para sa panlabas na pagkilos at ang patuloy na banta sa pandayuhang pag-atake (ang dalawang katangian ay sistema ng "multi-polar") na nagpapahiwatig na ang lakas ay limitado rin para sa panloob na pagkilos at dapat na nakadepende sa sariling sentro ng paggawa ng desisyon at kaya naman maaaring nilang gamitinng paunti-unti. (p. 78)

[^28]: Ang sentral na katangian ng modernong tradisyon na likas na batas (bilang kumakatawan kina St. Thomas Aquinas, Luis de Molina, Francisco Suarez, at ang panahon ng Espanyol Eskolastiko noong ika-labing-anim na siglo, at ang Protestanteng si Hugo Grotius) ay batay sa rasyonalismo: sa pangkabuuan, ang ideyang ito ay katanggap-tanggap, tunay, at mga prinsipyo na 'di mababali ng ugali ng tao na kailanman ay hindi matatawaran nang kahit anong teolohiyang paniniwala-na natuklasan at natagpuan at naging dahilan. Ang "Man" na akda ni Frederick C. Copleston, [*Aquinas* (London: Penguin Books, 1955), pp. 213–14] ay hindi kayang basahin na tulad ng kung ano ang nasa isip ng Panginoon … (ngunit) kaya niyang makilala ang mga pangunahin na maaaring maganap at kanyang mga likas na kailangan, at sa tulong ng pagsasalamin sa kanila na maaaring humantong sa kaalaman ng likas na moral na batas…. Na hinahangad ng bawat tao … ang malinaw na dahilan kung saan siya sumasalamin … ipahayag sa kanyang sarili ang likas na batas, na sa kabuuan ng pangkalahatang paniniwala na batay sa tamang dahilan na may kinalaman sa kabutihan na siyang dapat gawin at ang kasamaan na dapat layuan.

Gayun pa man, ang mga ideya ng pagkamakatuwiran ng tao, kalayaan, at pribadong pag-aari ay hindi pa rin naipapakalat ng maayos. Nagmula lamang sa ilang magkakahiwalay na lugar, ang humigit-kumulang na kapangyarihan ng pyudal na likas na kinilala tulad ng mga pagpapaunlad bilang banta sa kanilang sariling katatagan na muling binuo bilang kanilang lakas. Gamit ang pagsasama-sama ng mga teritoryo sa mahabang proseso ng pakikibaka at pakikidigma ng "interfeudal" sa malaking sukat ng mga estado at sa gayon ang pagtutuon ng pansin at pagsasama-sama ng kanilang mga lakas, kaya nilang matagumpay na pagbagsakin ang kumpetisyon ng ideya na ang kalayaan ay pamumukadkarin sa ilang mga lugar at muling pagpataw ng kanilang mapagsamantalang batas tulad sa mga lugar na may dagdag na lakas. Ang itatagal ng absolutismo ay nakaayos na, kasabay nito ang malakas na pwersa ng pyudal, ang monarkiya, ang samahan ng modernong bansa ng estado. Gamit ang paghawak sa absolutismo, ang mga nangungunang teritoryo ng malayang mga lungsod ay muling mapipilitan ang pagbagsak at walang pagsulong na ekonomiya, na sa ilang pagkakataon ay tumatagal ng siglo.

Yet this victory did not defeat the ideas of freedom and private property. On the contrary, these ideas found ever more powerful expression and increasingly inspired public opinion. Influenced by the continuously advanced natural rights tradition, another secularized intellectual tradition emerged and captivated minds: The tradition of what later became known as classical liberalism and was even more decisively centered around the notion of individual freedom and property and devoted to its intellectual justification.[^31] In addition, stimulated by the recent experiences of unrivaled prosperity achieved under conditions of freedom and contractualism, the development of economic thinking took great strides. The then orthodox statist doctrines of mercantilism, cameralism, and *Polizeiwissenschaft* became intellectually demolished by a swelling number of new political economists who systematically explained, with great thoroughness and comprehensiveness, the indispensable role of private property and contractualism for the process of production and wealth formation and who accordingly hailed a policy of radical laissez-faire.[^32]

[^31]: As the outstanding champion of this tradition see John Locke, *Two Treatises of Government*, ed. Peter Laslett (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1960).

    > [E]very man has a property in his own person. This nobody has any right to but himself. The labour of his body and the work of his hands, we may say, are properly his. Whatsoever then he removes out of the state that nature hath provided, and left in it, he hath mixed his labour with, and joined to it something that is his own, and thereby makes it his property. It being by him removed from the common state nature placed it in, it hath by his labour something annexed to it that excludes the common right of other men. For this labour being the unquestionable property of the labourer, no man but he can have a right to what that is once joined to. (p. 305)

From about 1700 onward, public opinion was captivated by these ideas to such an extent that revolutionary conditions emerged within the absolutist monarchies in Western Europe. England had already gone through a number of revolutions during the seventeenth century that severely shattered the powers of the absolutist state. The eighteenth century ended with the cataclysmic events of the American and French revolutions. Then until about the mid-nineteenth century a constant series of upheavals gradually stripped away governmental exploitation to an all-time low all over Western Europe.

The idea that had conquered public opinion and that had made this reduction of governmental power possible was that individual freedom and private property are just, self-evident, natural, inviolable and holy, and that any invader of such rights, a governmental agent no less (or even more so) than a private offender, should be regarded and treated as a contemptuous outcast.

With each successful step towards liberation, the movement grew stronger. In addition, the so-called Industrial Revolution that had been ushered in by these ideological changes and that had brought about unheard of economic growth rates, sustaining for the first time a steadily increasing population and gradually but continuously raising the general standard of living, created an almost unbounded optimism.[^33] To be sure, in Western Europe there was still plenty of feudal and absolutist despotism left even during the first half of the nineteenth century when the ideology of freedom and private property and of anti-statist vigilance reached its highest level of popularity, but progress toward an ever farther-reaching erosion of the exploitative powers of government and toward freedom and economic prosperity seemed almost unstoppable.[^34] In addition, there now existed an independent America, free of a feudal past and with hardly any government at all, that assumed a role similar to that of the free cities of the middle ages: of serving as a source of ideological inspiration and a center of attraction but on a much larger scale.[^35]

[^33]: On the Industrial Revolution and its misinterpretation by the orthodox (school-book) historiography see F.A. Hayek, ed., *Capitalism and the Historians* (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1963).

[^34]: In fact, though the decline of liberalism began around the mid-nineteenth century, the optimism that it had created survived until the early twentieth century. Thus, John Maynard Keynes could write [*The Economic Consequences of the Peace* (London: Macmillan, 1919)]:

    > What an extraordinary episode in the economic progress of man that age was which came to an end in August 1914! The greater part of the population, it is true, worked hard and lived at a low standard of comfort, yet were, to all appearances, reasonably contented with this lot. But escape was possible, for any man of capacity or character at all exceeding the average, into the middle and upper classes, for whom life offered, at a low cost and with the least trouble, convenience, comforts, and amenities beyond the compass of the richest and most powerful monarchs of other ages…. But, most important of all, he [man] regarded this state of affairs as normal, certain, and permanent, except in the direction of further improvement, and any deviation from it as aberrant, scandalous, and avoidable. The projects and politics of militarism and imperialism, of racial and cultural rivalries, of monopolies, restrictions, and exclusion, which were to play the serpent to this paradise, were little more than the amusements of his daily newspaper, and appeared to exercise almost no influence at all on the ordinary course of social and economic life, the internationalization of which was nearly complete in practice. (pp. 6–7)

    For a similar account see also J.P. Taylor, *English History 1914–15* (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1965), p. 1.

[^35]: Characterizing nineteenth-century America Robert Higgs (*Crisis and Leviathan* [New York: Oxford University Press, 1987]) writes:

    > There was a time, long ago, when the average American could go about his daily business hardly aware of the government—especially the federal government. As a farmer, merchant, or manufacturer, he could decide what, how, when, and where to produce and sell his goods, constrained by little more than market forces. Just think: no farm subsidies, price supports, or acreage controls; no Federal Trade Commission; no antitrust laws; no Interstate Commerce Commission. As an employer, employee, consumer, investor, lender, borrower, student, or teacher, he could proceed largely according to his own lights. Just think: no National Labor Relations Board; no federal consumer “protection” laws; no Securities and Exchange Commission; no Equal Employment Opportunity Commission; no Department of Health and Human Services. Lacking a central bank to issue national paper currency, people commonly used gold coins to make purchases. There were no general sales taxes, no Social Security taxes, no income taxes. Though governmental officials were as corrupt then as now—maybe more so—they had vastly less to be corrupt with. Private citizens spent about fifteen times more than all governments combined. (p. IX)

Today, little is left of this ethic of private property and its anti-government vigilance. Although they now take place on a much grander scale, governmental appropriations of private property owners are overwhelmingly regarded as legitimate. There is no longer a general public opinion that regards government as an antisocial institution based on coercion and unjust property acquisitions, to be opposed and ridiculed everywhere and at all times on principled grounds. No longer is it generally regarded as morally despicable to propagate or, even worse, to actively participate in the enforcement of acts of expropriation, and no longer is it the general opinion that one would not have any private dealings whatsoever with people who engaged in such activities.

On the contrary, instead of being laughed off the stage or met with open hostility or passive indignation, such people are respected as decent and honest men. The politician who actively supports a continuation of the ongoing system of non-contractual property taxation and regulation or who even demands its expansion is treated everywhere with respect, rather than contempt. The intellectual who justifies taxation and regulation receives recognition as a deep and profound thinker in the public eye, instead of being exposed as an intellectual fraud. The IRS agent is regarded as a man doing a job just as legitimate as yours and mine, and not as an outcast that no one wishes to have as a relative, friend, or neighbor.

How could government accomplish such a feat and bring about a change in public opinion that removed the former constraint on its size and instead allowed (and still allows) it to grow in absolute as well as relative terms?[^36]

[^36]: On the following see in particular A.V. Dicey, *Lectures on the Relation Between Law and Public Opinion in England* (New Brunswick, N.J.: Transaction Books, 1981); Elie Halevy, *A History of the English People in the 19th Century*, 2 vols. (London: Benn, 1961); W.H. Greenleaf, *The British Political Tradition*, 3 vols. (London: Methuen, 1983–87); Arthur E. Ekirch, *The Decline of American Liberalism* (New York: Atheneum, 1976); Higgs, *Crisis and Leviathan*.

There can be no doubt that the key element in this turn-around of public opinion that started to take hold in Western Europe around the mid-nineteenth century, around the turn of this century in the U.S., and then at a steadily accelerating pace everywhere after World War I[^37] has been the emergence of attractive new—implicitly or explicitly—statist ideologies.

[^37]: On the worldwide excesses of statism since World War I see Paul Johnson, *Modern Times: The World from the Twenties to the Eighties* (New York: Harper and Row, 1983).

In fact, states have always been aware of the decisive importance of state-supportive ideologies for stabilizing and increasing their exploitative grip on a population, and in this knowledge they have always made attempts to exert their control, above all, over the institutions of education. Even at their weakest, it should appear natural to see them give particular attention to “correct” ideological instruction and to concentrate whatever is left of their power on the destruction of all independent institutions of learning and their take-over into the states’ monopolistic hands. Accordingly, in order to regain the upper hand in the permanent struggle of ideas, since the mid-nineteenth century a steady process of nationalizing or socializing schools and universities (with one of the most recent examples being the unsuccessful attempt by the Mitterand government to crush France’s Catholic schools) and lengthening the period of compulsory schooling has taken place.[^38]

[^38]: On the relation between state and education see Murray N. Rothbard, *Education, Free and Compulsory: The Individual’s Education* (Wichita, Kans.: Center for Independent Education, 1972).

Yet pointing out this and the related facts of an increasingly close alliance between state and intellectuals[^39] and the latter’s rewriting history in line with statist ideologies merely puts the problem into focus. Indeed, when one hears about the state’s take-over of the system of education, must one not immediately ask how it could succeed in doing so if public opinion were really committed to a private property ethic?! Such a take-over presupposes a change in public opinion. How, then, was this accomplished, especially in view of the fact that such a change implies the acceptance of manifestly wrong ideas and thus can hardly be explained as an endogenously motivated process of intellectual advancement?

[^39]: On the relation between state and intellectuals see Julien Benda, *The Treason of the Intellectuals* (New York: Norton, 1969).

It would seem that such a change toward falsehood requires the systematic introduction of exogenous forces: A true ideology is capable of supporting itself merely by virtue of being true. A false one needs reinforcement by outside influences with a clear-cut, tangible impact on people in order to be capable of generating and supporting a climate of intellectual corruption.

It is to these tangible, ideology-supporting and reinforcing factors that one must turn to understand the decline of the private property ethic and the corresponding rise of statism during the last 100 to 150 years.[^40]

[^40]: On the following see in particular Hoppe, *Eigentum, Anarchie, und Staat*, chaps. 1, 5; idem, *A Theory of Socialism and Capitalism*, chap. 8.

I will discuss four such factors and explain their corruptive function for public opinion. All are changes in the organizational structure of the state. The first one is the state’s structural adjustment from a military or police state toward a redistributive one. (The prototype of such an organizational change is the often copied Prussia under Bismarck.) Instead of a governmental structure that is characterized by a small ruling class that uses its exploitatively appropriated resources almost exclusively for pure governmental consumption or for the maintenance of its military and police forces, states now increasingly engage in a policy of actively buying support among the people outside of the governmental apparatus itself. Through a system of transfer payments, grants of privilege to special clients, and governmental production and provision of certain “civilian” goods and services (as for instance education), the population is made increasingly dependent on the continuation of state rule. People outside the governmental apparatus increasingly have a tangible financial stake in its existence and would be harmed, at least in the short run and in parts of their existence, if the government were to lose power. Quite naturally, this dependency tends to reduce resistance and increase support. Exploitation may still seem reprehensible, but it is less so if one also happens to be someone who at least on some fronts is a legal benefactor of such actions.
