Mayroong isang tanging importanting elemento na hanggang ngayon sa nawawala mula sa isang kompletong rekonstrusyon ng kasalukuyang internasyonal order: pera. Sa natural na interes ng estado na palawakin ang teritoryo nito sa militar; at samakatuwid, dapat isa asahan ang isang ugali patungo sa isang kamag-anak na konsentrasyon ng mga estado. Nasa interes din ng estado na makibahagi sa “perang imperyalismo” (ibig sabihin, upang palawigin ang kapangyarihan ng pag-iwas sa mga mas malaking teritoryo); sa gayon, ang isang pagkahilig patungo sa isang isang-daigdig na pera sa papel ay dapat na inaasahan. Ang mga interes at ang mga tendensya ay parehong umakma sa isa't isa. Sa isang banda, ang anumang hakbang sa direksyon ng isang internasyonal na maghuwad ng kartel ay tiyak na mabibigo kung hindi ito kinumpleto sa pamamagitan ng pagtatatag ng militar na pangingibabaw at herarkiya. Ang panlabas at panloob na pang-ekonomiyang mga presyon ay may posibilidad na sumabog sa kartel. Sa militar na higit na kataasan, gayunpaman, posible ang isang kartel sa pagpintog. Sa kabilang banda, sa sandaling ang pangingibabaw ng militar ay naging posible ng isang kartel, ang tunay na estado ay maaaring palawakin ang kanyang mapagsamantalang kapangyarihan sa ibang mga teritoryo na walang karagdagang digmaan at panunupil. Sa katunayan, ang internasyonal na kartelisasyon ng palsipikado ay nagbibigay-daan sa nangingibabaw na estado na ipagpatuloy ang mas sopistikadong (ibig sabihin, hindi gaanong nakikita) ay nangangahulugang hindi maaaring makamit ang digmaan at pagsakop.

Sa unang hakbang ay ang nangingibabaw na estado (isang estado, iyon ay, na maaaring magwasak ng isa pang militar at itinuturing na may kakayahang gawin ito, lalo na ng dominadong gubyerno) ay gagamit ng kayang higit na kapangyarihan nito upang ipatupad ang isang patakaran ng internasyona sal koordinadong implasyon. Ang sarili nitong bangko ng sentral ay nagtatakda ng mabilis na proseso ng pag-iwas, at ang mga bangko ng sentral ng mga pinangungunahan na estado ay iniutos na pahintulutan kasama ang nangingibabaw sa estado. Sa mga termino na praktikal, ipinapataw ang pera sa dominado na estado bilang isang reserbang pera sa mga banyagang sentral na bangko, at napipilitang gamitin ito bilang batayan para sa kanilang sariling mga aksyon sa implasyon.

Hindi napipigilan ang aktwal na demand pero sa pamamagitan lamang ng pampublikong opinyon, ito ay medyo madali para sa isang nangingibabaw na estado upang magawa ang layuning ito. Direktang pagsakop sa teritoryo at ang direktang pagpapatupad ng sarili nitong pera sa mga banyagang teritoryo ay maaaring humahadlang sa estado ng pambansa o dayuhang opinyon ng publiko. Subalit sa kapangyarihan na sirain ang anumang tiyak na dayuhang pamahalaan-kahit na naisip na nito ay hindi sapat na malakas para sa isang kumpletong pag-aalala at kinakailangan upang ang nangingibabaw na estado ay magtagumpay sa *monetaryong* imperyalismo.

Sa loob, malamang na hindi makatagpo ng anumang pagtutol. Ang gobyerno mismo ay nasiyahan sa solusyon na ito. Sa isang banda ang sariling pera ay nagtatrabaho bilang isang reserbang pera ng mga bangko sa ibang bansa kung saan pagkatapos ay tumaas ang kanilang iba't ibang mga pambansang papel na pera, pagkatapos ay magiging posible ito upang makagawa ng halos walang gastos na ekspropriasyon ng mga dayuhang may-ari ng ari-arian at mga tagagawa ng kita nang hindi kinakailangang takutin ang mga kahihinatnan. Kahalintulad nito, ang sarili nitong bangko at negosyo sa piling tao ay handa na tanggapin ang ganitong kaayusan, dahil maaari rin silang ligtas na lumahok sa dayuhang pagsasamantala. Ang mga bangko sa partikular ay masigasig. At ang publiko ay higit na walang nalalaman kung ano ang nangyayari, o isinasaalang-alang ang pagsasamantala ng mga dayuhan maliban sa mga problemang panloob.

Sa labas, ang mga usapin ay bahagyang mas kumplikado. Ang dominadong estado ay mawawalan at mangingibabaw sa mga mapagkukunan sa dominasyon bilang resulta ng salapi na rehimen. Subalit may posibilidad na maharap at mawalan ang panloob na kontrol nito, natural na mas gusto nito ang pagtanggap sa isang pamamaraan na hindi lamang magpapagusto nito na manatiling may kapangyarihan at upang aktwal na magpatuloy sa sarili nitong mapanlinlang na mga ekspropriasyon ng sarili nitong populasyon sa pamamagitan ng pagpapalago ng pera nito sa pinakamataas at sa alinsunod sa paglikha ng pera sa dominasyong estado. Ang dahilan ng isang bangko para sa mga elite ng negosyo, bilang unang tagatanggap ng pekeng pera ng kani-kanilang estado, ay handa na tanggapin ang solusyon na ito. At ang pangkalahatang publiko sa mga teritoryo na denomado, na sa pamamagitan ng pag-aayos ay napapailalim sa isang dobleng patong ng pagsasamantala sa mga elite ng mga dayuhang estado sa ibabaw ng isang pambansang estado at piling tao, ay higit sa lahat hindi alam ng lahat ng ito at nabigo na kilalanin ito bilang isang mahalagang dahilan ng sarili nitong matagal na pang-ekonomiyang magtitiwala at pagwawalang-kilos ng kasamahan sa buong dominanteng bansa.

Ang unang hakbang na ito, gayunpaman ay hindi nagbibigay ng perpektong solusyon. Sa sistema ngainternasyonal n pera ay nailalarawan sa pamamagitan ng isang nangingibabaw na pera ng papel, at ng mga maraming mga pambansang mga perang papel na pyramiding sa ibabaw nito, at malayang nagbabago ang mga halaga ng palitan sa pagitan ng mga pera.

Sa isang dako, ito ay mas mababa kaysa sa nakasisiya para sa nangingibabaw na estado, kasi sa ilalim ng mga pangyayaring ito ang sapat na silid ay naiwan para sa posibilidad ng sarili niyang pera na bumababa sa iba, at ang ganitong pag-unlad ay magbubunga ng sarili nitong papel bilang dominanteng kapangyarihan. Para sa mga palitan ng kabayaran ay hindi eksklusibong natutukoy ng mga patakaran ng implasyon sa iba't ibang proseso ng mga sentral na bangko. Sa huli at *ceteris paribus*, natutukoy ang mga ito sa pamamagitan ng pagbili ng pariti ng kapangyarihan [^30] At dahil ang isang dominadong sentral na bangko ay kusang lumalaki kasama ang dominanteng sentral na bangko, iba pang mga rason dito (tulad ng mas mababang antas ng pagbubuwis at regulasyon, halimbawa) maaari pa ring mapahalagahan ang pera nito laban sa na dominanteng estado.

On the other hand, the existence of a multitude of currencies freely fluctuating against each other is, as explained earlier, dysfunctional of the very purpose of money. It is a system of partial barter. It creates informational chaos, makes rational economic calculation impossible, accordingly leads to inefficiencies within the very system of production which the dominant state parasitically rests.

Thus, in order to assure its dominant position and maximize exploitatively appropriated income, in a second step a dominant state will invariably try to institute an international—and ultimately universal—currency monopolistically controlled and issued either directly by its own central bank or indirectly by an international or world bank dominated by its central bank.

There are some obstacles on the way to this goal. However, once the first step has been completed successfully, none of them would seem insurmountable. Naturally, the dominated state would lose some discretionary power under this arrangement. But this would be compensated for by the fact that its own economy would function more efficiently, too, if calculational chaos in international trade were reduced. Further, the banking and business elite in both countries would be adamantly in favor of such a monetary regime and would use their close ties to their respective state and international connections to promote its adoption. For, after all, banks and industrial firms are also in the business of making money through production and exchanges. Freely fluctuating exchange rates are an artificial impediment in their pursuit of this economic interest. And they will be perceived as dysfunctional more intensively by larger businesses, because it is big business, in particular, for which foreign trade plays a more important role.

In fact, the most severe resistance to the adoption of an international currency is to be expected not from the states and the economic elites, but from the general public. Insofar as an international currency implies giving up an accustomed one, it runs against the very nationalism that all states eagerly bred for so long. This would be a problem especially if the public in the dominated countries were asked to adopt the dominant state’s currency directly—name and all—because the underlying imperialist nature of such a monetary system would then become dangerously apparent. Yet with some degree of diplomacy and patient propaganda, this problem seems solvable, too. A new currency with a new name must be created and defined in terms of existing national monies in order not to arouse nationalistic or anti-imperialist sentiments. This new currency must only be somewhat overvalued against the various national monies (which in turn are defined in terms of the new currency) in order to drive all national monies out of circulation (in accordance with Gresham’s law).[^31] This must be accompanied by the states’ and the economic elites’ constant appeal to the general public’s sound economic intuition that—regardless of all nationalistic feelings—freely fluctuating national monies are an anachronistic institution which cripples rational economic calculation, and that it is in everyone’s best interest to have an internationally (and if possible universally) used money such as the international banking system under the leadership of the dominant state’s central bank is willing to provide. Barring any drastic change in public opinion in the direction of a strengthened private property and sound money orientation and a correspondingly increased antistate vigilance, nothing will prevent the dominant state from achieving this complete international counterfeiting autonomy. And with a world money and world bank in place, and controlled by the dominant state’s central bank, a decisive step is taken toward reaching its ultimate goal of establishing itself as a full-scale world government, with world-wide control not only over counterfeiting, but also over taxation and legal regulation.

In light of this explanation of monetary imperialism and its function as a “natural” (from a statist viewpoint, that is) complement of military expansionism, the remaining pieces from the history of international politics fall into place. Hand in hand with the rise of Great Britain to the rank of the foremost imperialist nation state went a sterling imperialism. Not entirely free at the time of all internal obstacles in the way of counterfeiting, British-dominated countries were compelled to keep their reserves in the form of sterling balances in London, where the Bank of England would redeem them in gold. This way, these countries would pyramid their national currencies on top of the pound, and Britain could inflate sterling notes on top of gold without having to fear an outflow of gold. With Britain’s decline and the concurrent rise of the U.S. government to the position of the world’s leading military power, sterling imperialism has gradually been replaced by a dollar imperialism. At the end of World War II, with U.S. domination extended over most of the globe, and essentially ratified in the Bretton Woods agreement, the dollar became the world reserve currency on top of which all other states have inflated their various national paper monies.[^32] For a while, the U.S. officially still maintained the pretense of redeeming foreign central banks’ dollars in gold, and this somewhat limited its own inflationary potential. However, it did not prevent steady dollar counterfeiting on top of gold from occurring. The position of the U.S. as a militarily dominant international power (in the meantime formalized through a number of military pacts, most notably the NATO) allowed it to compel foreign governments to exercise their right to ask for redemption only sparingly if at all, so that its own dollar inflation could take place without setting off contractive consequences. And when its counterfeiting policy had incited foreign governments to become all too daring in their attempts to obtain gold at bargain prices, it was the U.S. government’s superior military might that finally allowed it to give up all pretense and declare its notes irredeemable. Since then the Federal Reserve System has acquired the position of an autonomous counterfeiter of last resort to the entire international banking system.[^33]

The imperialist nature of this dollar standard takes effect in particular through such instruments as the International Monetary Fund (IMF), the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD), and the Bank for International Settlement (BIS).[^34] Money and credit, created by the strike of a pen, is passed from these U.S.-dominated institutions first to foreign governments which inflate their national currencies on top of it and in turn pass this money on to their own cartelized banking system which, adding a further dose of counterfeiting, then hand it on to the various states’ favorite business establishments whence it ripples to the economic periphery. Parallel to this flow of money goes a reversed process of income and wealth redistribution from the periphery onto national business and banking elites and the various nation states as well as from the dominated territories to the U.S. government and the U.S. banking and business establishment as the ultimate center of world finance.

From a sociological point of view, the consequences are particularly interesting if these two integrated processes are superimposed on pre-modern, feudal societies. Such countries, primarily in Africa, Asia, Central and South America, are typically characterized by a class of feudal landlords, or feudal landlords-turned-financial-orindustrial-magnates controlling the state apparatus and mostly residing in the capital-city-and-seat-of-government; and by a class of largely landless, dependent peasants dispersed over the countryside and sustaining the state, the feudal elite, and the capital city through the payment of land rents.[^35] Dollar imperialism here means upholding feudal rule, supporting and participating in the exploitation of an impoverished peasantry and the countryside by a parasitic feudal caste and the capital city, and contributing in the latter’s suppression of any liberationist land reform movement. In fact, the typical Third World cycle of ruthless government oppression, revolutionary movements, civil war, renewed suppression, and prolonged economic dependency and mass poverty is to a significant extent caused and maintained by the U.S.-dominated international monetary system.

Since 1971, in particular, increased efforts have been undertaken in the direction of the second step in the process of monetary expansionism. Not all of the roughly 160 freely fluctuating currencies actually pose a problem, because most of them are in no danger for internal reasons of appreciating against the dollar and thereby strengthening the respective states’ power vis-à-vis that of the U.S. government, or they play such a minor role in international trade that the calculational chaos which is introduced by their existence is largely insignificant. However, because of the relative strength of their currencies and their important role in international trade, the major West European states as well as Japan are a problem. Hence it is to these states and currencies in particular that U.S-led attempts to create a world currency that helps rationalize economic calculation and at the same time safeguard U.S. domination and further increase its own inflationary powers have been directed. The creation of Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), defined initially in terms of sixteen and later five leading export nations, and issued by the IMF, was a move toward a one-world currency and a one-world bank under U.S. domination.[^36] Another important push toward this goal was provided through the activities of the Trilateral Commission (TC), founded in 1973 as an offshoot of David Rockefeller’s Council on Foreign Relations. Composed of some 300 highly influential politicians, bankers, businessmen, as well as intellectuals and journalists from North America, Western Europe and Japan, the TC has made the establishment of a world paper currency and a world central bank its primary concern.[^37] Fervently supported by the TC as an intermediate step toward this ultimate goal as well as by several other politicianbanker-industrialist associations with a substantial overlap of membership with the TC and devoted to the same ends, such as the Action Committee for Europe, the Association for the Monetary Union of Europe, the Banking Federation of the European Community, the ECU Banking Association, the Basel Committee and the Wilton Park Group, great advances have been made in aligning the European monetary front. In 1979, the newly created European Currency Unit (ECU), issued under the aegis of the European Economic Community, first appeared. Defined as a weighted average of ten European currencies, and assisted by organizations such as the European Monetary System, the European Investment Bank, the Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications, and the European Monetary Cooperation Fund, the ECU has assumed a more and more important rule. Since as an average it is less volatile than the various national currencies, multinational banks and corporations in particular have found it increasingly attractive to use the ECU as a unit of account and a medium of settlement: economic calculation is less haphazard with only three currencies—the ECU, the yen, and the dollar—than with a dozen. In 1998, according to official intergovernmental agreements, the European Central Bank was established and the ECU became the all-European currency supplanting all national monies.[^38]

With the European calculational chaos solved, then, and in particular with the European hard currency countries neutralized and weakened within a cartel that by its very nature favors more against less inflationary countries so as to protect and prolong U.S. hegemony over Europe, little indeed would remain to be done. With essentially only three central banks and currencies and U.S. dominance over Europe and Japan, the most likely candidates to be chosen as a U.S-dominated World Central Bank are the IMP or the BIS: and under its aegis then, initially defined as a basket of the dollar, the ECU, and the yen, the “phoenix” (or whatever else its name may be) will rise as a one-world paper currency—unless, that is, public opinion as the only constraint on government growth undergoes a substantial change and the public begins to understand the lesson explained in this book: that economic rationality as well as justice and morality demand a worldwide gold standard and free, 100-percentreserve banking as well as free markets worldwide; and that world government, a world central bank and a world paper currency—contrary to the deceptive impression of representing universal values—actually means the universalization and intensification of exploitation, counterfeiting-fraud and economic destruction.[^39]
