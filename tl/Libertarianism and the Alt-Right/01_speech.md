Alam natin ang tadhana ng terminong liberal at liberalismo. Ito ay naidikit na nang sa ganun maraming magkakaibang mga tao at mga magkakaibang posisyon na nawalan ng buo nitong kahulugan at naging isang bakante, isang label na hindi mai-larawan. Parehong landas ang patuloy na tumataas ang siyang bumabanta sa terminong libertaryano at libertaryanismo na naimbento para bawiin ang iilan sa mga nawalang presisyon na konseptwal sa pag-lugmok ng nakaraang mga label.

Subalit, ang kasaysayan ng modernong libertaryanismo ay masyadong maaga pa. Ito ay nagsimula sa sala ni Murray Rothbard at namulat ang unang kwasi-kanonikal na ekspresyon sa kanyang *Para Sa Bagong Libertad. Isang Manifesto ng Libertaryano*, nai-publish taong 1973. At ako ay umaasa at hindi pa handang sumuko sa libertaryanismo na naka-defayn at naipalawanag ni Rothbard na walang katulad na konseptwal sa klaridad at presisyon, gayunpaman, samantalang hindi mabilang na pagtatangka ng mga kung-tawagin na mga libertaryano na gawing maputik ang tubig at ang di ka-angkop-angkop sa magandang pangalan ng libertaryanismo para sa anumang bagay na ibang-iba sa kabuuan.

Ang teoryatikal, irreputableng core ng doktrinang libertaryano ay simple at direkta sa punto at naipaliwanag ko na ito makailang beses sa lugar na ito. Kung walang kakulangan dito sa mundo, imposible sana ang mga girian ng mga tao o mas eksaktong sagupaang pangpisikal. Ang mga giriang interpersonal ay kadalasan mga girian na kung saan ito ay patungkol sa mga bagay na kinukulang. Gusto kong gawin ang A kasama ang isang bagay na binigay at gusto mong ring gawin ang B sa kaparehang bagay. Dahil sa mga giriang iyon - at dahil tayo ay may kakayahang makapag-komunika at makipagtalo sa bawat isa - tayo ay humahanap sa mga pag-uugaling nakaugalian sa layuning makapag-iwas sa mga giriang ito. Ang layunin ng mga kaugaling ito ay para sa pag-iwas-ng-girian. Kung hindi natin gusto iwasan ang mga girian, ang paghahanap para sa mga kaugalian ng pag-kondukt ay walang puwang. Tayo ay simpleng maglalaban at magsasagupa.

Ang kawalan ng isang harmoniyang perpekto sa lahat ng mga interes, mga girian ayon sa kakulangan ng mga pagkukunang yaman ay maaari lamang maiwasan kung ang lahat ng mga pinagkukunang yaman na kulang ay italaga bilang isang pribado, ekslusibong pag-aari sa iilang mga indibidwal na naka-espesipiko o pangkat ng mga indibidwal. Doon lamang tayo maaaring makakapag-akto ng malaya, sa *aking* sariling mga bagay. mula sa'yo, sa *'yong* sariling mga bagay, na walang ikaw at ako na nag-gigirian.

Ngunit sino ang nagmamay-ari ng kung anong pinagkukunang yaman na kulang bilang kanyang sariling pribadong propyedad at sino ang hindi? Una: Bawat tao ay nagmamay-ari ng kani-kanilang katawang pisikal na siya lamang at walang iba pa ang kumokontrol nang *direktahan*. At pangalawa, para sa mga pinagkukunang yaman na kinulang na maaring makontrol *lamang*nang hindi direktahan[^1]: Ang pagkokontrol ng eklusibo [^2] ay makukuha sa pamamagitan ng at pag-talaga sa taong iyon, na siyang nag-angkop sa pinagkukunang yaman ng kwestiyon *una* o kung sinong nakapag-kuha nito sa paraaang boluntaryo[^3] pakikipagpalitan mula sa *nakaraang* may-ari nito. Para lamang sa *pinaka-unang* tagapagpapa-angkop sa pinagkukunang yaman[^4] ay posible na maaaring makapag-kuha at makapagtubo ng kontrol nito na walang girian, hal. nang mapayapa. O kung hindi ay, kung ang ekslusibong pagkontrol ay naitalaga sa halip na para sa *mga latecomer*, ang girian ay hindi naiiwasan ngunit kontraryo sa layunin ng mga kaugalian na naisagawang hindi maiiwasan at permanente.

Sa harap ng madlang ito Ako ay hindi na nangangailangang pumunta pa sa malaking detalye maliban sa pagdagdag nito: Kung gusto mong mamuhay ng payapa kasama ang ibang mga tao at makapag-iwas ng lahat ng mga giriang pisikal at, kung ang kagayang mga giriang ito ay nangyayari, humanap ng paraan para resolbahin ito nang mapayapa, tsaka ikaw ay dapat maging isang anarkista o mas eksakto bilang isang anarkista sa pribadong propyedad, isang anarko-kapitalista o isang tagayaguyod ng isang pribadong sosyedad ng batas.

At sa pamamagitan ng implikasyon, pagkatapos, at sa muli na walang karagdagang ado: isang tao, sinuman, ay *hindi*isang libertaryano o isang hamak na *pekeng* libertaryano na nag-apirma at nag-a-adhika ng isa o higit pa para sa mga sumusunod: ang necesidad ng isang Estado, anumang Estado, ng 'publikong' (Estado) propyedad at ng mga buwis nang sa ganun ay makapamuhay ng payapa; o ang eksistensya at hustifiyabilidad ng anumang na kung-tawagin "mga karapatang pantao" o "mga karapatang pansibil" maliban sa mga karapatan sa pribadong mga propyedad, kagaya ng "mga karapatan ng mga kababaihan," "mga karapatan ng mga bayot," "mga karapatan ng minorya", ang "karapatang" hindi mai-diskrimina laban sa, ang "karapatan" sa libreng at hindi istriktong imigrasyon, ang "karapatan" sa naka-garantong minimong sahod o sa libreng health care, o sa "karapatan" na pagiging libre ng di kanais-nais pakinggan na talumpati at napag-isipan. Ang mga may-akda ng anumang mga bagay na ito ay maaari nilang tawagin ang sarili nila kung ano ang ginugusto nila, at bilang mga libertaryano tayo ay magtutulungan sa kanila, sa gayon kagaya ng kooperasyong iyan ay nag-aalok ng pangako na tayo ay dalhin ng malapitan sa ating pinakapangunahing layunin, ngunit sila ay hindi *mga libertaryano* o sila lamang ay *di tunay* na mga libertaryano.

Sa ngayon, "isang bagay na katawa-tawa ay nangyari papunta sa forum". Habang si Rothbard at ako, na sumusunod sa kanyang mga yapak, ay hinding-hindi naligaw ang landas mula sa mga pangunahing paniniwala na nai-derive nang napakateroretikal, hindi lamang sa mga hindi libertaryano ngunit sa mga partikular na mga hindi tunay na mga libertaryano, hal. mga taong nagsasabing (walang katotohanan) na sila *ay* mga libertaryano, at kahit na posibleng may maraming matatapat ngunit mababaw lang ang pag-iisip na mga libertaryano na nakapili at naka-vilify sa atin bilang kanilang paboritong *maiitim na mga halimaw* at nag-i-inkarna ng kalagiman. Si Rothbard, ang *tagagabay sa espiritu* ng modernong libertaryanismo, na tinaguriang na kung-tawagin ay mga "kontra-pasista" na mga mararaming mga tao bilang reaksyonaryo, isang rasista, ang sexist, isang awtoritaryano, isang elitista, isang xenophobe, isang pasista at, higit sa lahat, isang Hudyong Nazi na may galit sa sarili. At ako ay nakapag-inherit sa lahat ng mga titulong pang-honoraryo, dagdagan pa ng iilan sa mga marami (maliban sa ekserpt na pang Hudyo). Kung kaya'y anong bagay na katawa-tawa ang nangyari rito?

Ang pagsusumikap sa pagdedebelop ng sagot sa katanungang ito ay humihila sa akin papunta sa paksa ng talumpating ito: ang pagkakaugnayan sa pagitan ng libertaryanismo at ang makakanang alternatibo o "Alt-Right," na kung saan ito ay nakapaghakot ng notoryadad mapa-nasyonal at mapa-internasyonal pagkatapos ni Hillary Clinton, ang naganap na nakaraang kampanya sa halalang pagkapangulo, inadentifika ito bilang isa sa mga pinagkukunan ng inspirasyon sa likod ng "basket ng mga deplorable" na pumipili para kay Trump [^5].

Ang kilusang Alt-Right ay ang esensyal na tagapagsunod sa kilusang paleo-konserbatibo na naging prominente sa unang bahagi ng 1990’s, kasama ang kolumnista at pinaka-naititindang awtor na si Patrick Buchanan bilang isang kinikilalang representatibo nito. Ito ay biglang nanahimik sa pagtapos ng 1990s, at sa kasalukuyan, dahil sa paglaki ng napakasteady sa mga sirang nagawa sa Amerika at sa reputasyon nito sa mga nagsunod sunod na mga administrasyon nina Bush I, Clinton, Bush II at Obama, sumulong muli ang napaka-bigor kumpara nung dati sa ilalim ng bagong tatak na Alt-Right. Marami sa mga nangungunang mga ilaw na nakapagkaugnayan sa Alt-Right ay nagpakita rito sa aming mga pagpupulong sa mga nagdaang mga taon. Si Paul Gottfried, siyang unang gumamit sa terminong yaon, sina Peter Brimelow, Richard Lynn, Jared Taylor, John Derbyshire, Steve Sailer at Richard Spencer. Kabilang na, ang pangalang Sean Gabb at ako ay regular na naiisabi sa koneksyon kasama ang Alt-Right, at ang aking akda ay naipag-ugnay sa mga kilusang neo-reaksyonaryong magkakalapit-lapit na inspirado ni Curtis Yarvin[^6] at kanyang blog na *Mga Reserbasyong Hindi Kwalipikado* hindi na umiiral. Sa kabuuan, ang mga relasyon at mga asosasyong pangpersonal ay nagbigay sa akin ng maraming mga honorableng pagtawag sa pinakasikat na smear-at-defamasyon na liga ng Amerika, ang SPLC[^7].

Ngayon: Paano na ang tungkol sa ugnayang namamagitan sa libertaryanismo at ang Alt-Right at ang aking mga rason para sa pag-iimbita sa mga nangungunang representatibo ng Alt-Right sa mga pagpupulong kasama ang mga libertaryano? Ang mga libertaryano ay nagkakaisa sa pangunahing mga paniniwalang teoretikal na hinding-hindi masasagutan na naimensyon sa awtset. Sila ay klaro tungkol sa kanilang tinatamasa na gustong-gusto nilang matamo. Ngunit ang doktrinang libertaryano ay hindi nag-i-implay ng anumang bagay na umuukol sa kwestyong *ito*:

1. Paano naipapanatili ang order bilang libertaryano kung ito ay naitamo na;
2. Paano matatamasa ang order ng pagkakalibertaryano mula sa pansimulang punto ng isang hindi libertaryano, na kung saan ito ay nangangailangang: 
    1. Ang isang iyan ay dapat maiwasto para mai-deskrayb sa panimulang puntong;
    2. I-identipika ng wasto ang mga obstakel na nag-aanyo sa pamamaraang ang isang libertaryano ay nagtatapos sa pinakapansimulang puntong ito.

Para makapagsago sa mga kwestiyon na ito, sa pagkakadagdag sa teorya, ikaw ay nangangailangan ng iilan sa mga aralin ng saykolohiya at sosyolohiya ng tao o higit pa sa kaunting sentidong common. Sa ngayon maraming mga libertaryano at mga pekeng libertaryano ay isang ignorante lamang sa saykolohiya at sosyolohiya ng tao o kahit na yung kinuhaan ng anumang sentido komon. Parang bulag nilang tinatanggap, kasalungat sa lahat ng ebidensyang empirikal, isang egalitaryani, slate-na-blangko na pananaw ng sa katauhang natura, ng lahat ng mga tao at lahat ng mga sosyedad at mga kulturang napakaesensyal sa pagkakapantay-pantay at pagpapalit.

Habang karamihan sa kontemporaryong libertaranismo ay maaaring mai-karakterisa, pagkatapos, bilang isang teorya at mga teorista na walang saykolohiya at sosyolohiya, higit pa o ang lahat ng Alt-Right ay maaaring mai-deskrayb na may kaibahan, ang saykolohiya at sosyolohiyang walang teorya. Ang mga Alt-Right ay hindi nagkakaisa sa pangkalimitang teoryang pinaghahawakan, at walang umiiral na anumang bagay kahit na ang mga magkakahawig na bahagyang isang tekstong kanonikal na dumedefayn sa kahulugan nito. Sa halip, ang Alt-Right ay napakamahalagang nagkakaisa sa kanilang kahulugan sa mundong kontemporaryong ito, at partikular na ang US at ang kung-tawagin ang Mundo ng mga Kanluranin, at sa identipikasyon at dayagnosis sa mga patholohiyang sosyal na ito. Sa katunayan, ito ay napuna na nang napakawasto na ang Alt-Right ay mas higit na nagkakaisa kumpara sa kung ano ang kani-kanilang pinagkakasalungatan. Kung ito ay salungat, at talaga nga ito ay may galit na may pasyon, ang mga elitistang na siyang kumokontrol sa Estado, sa MSM at sa akademya. Bakit? Dahil silang lahat ay sumusulong para sa sosyal na degenerasiya at patholohiya. Kung gayun, sila ay nagsusulong, at ang Alt-Right ay pwersahang sumasalungat, egalitaryanismo, aksyong afirmatibo [^8], multikulturalismo, ang “libreng” maramihang imigrasyon bilang pamamaraan sa pagdadala ukol sa multikuluralismo. At tsaka, ang Alt-right ay kinamumuhian nila ang saanmang na nagsa-smak sa Marxismo o Gramsciisimo na pangkultural at ang lahat ng “kawastohang politikal” at, sa wais na istratehiya, sila ay kumikibit, na walang anumang panghihingi ng kapatawaran nang kung anuman, sa lahat ng mga akusasyong bilang rasista, seksita, elitista, supremasista, homophobe, tsenophobe, atbp., atbp. At ang Alt-Right ay tumatawa lang sa walang pag-asang walang puwang na mottong progmatiko ng kung-tawagin na mga libertaryano kagaya ng ang _Mga Estudyante para sa Libertad_[^9] ng “Kapayapaan, Pag-Ibig at Libertad,” na winastong sinalin sa Aleman ni Lichtschlag bilang “Fride, Freude, Wierkuchen.” Sa istarkong paghahambing nito, ang mga maka-Alt-Right ay gumigiit na ang buhay ay tungkol rin sa sigalitan, poor, pagsasalpukan at away, hindi lamang sa pagitan ng mga indibidwal pero pati na rin sa mga mararaming grupo ng mga tao na umaakto sa konsyerto. “- _Kasawian ng mga Milenyal”_[^10] ay sa gayun nag-susumaruo na ang Alt-Right ay:

> Ang pagkakapantay-pantay ay nakaka-bwesit. Napakahalaga ang herarkiya. Magkakaiba ang mga lahi. Magkakaiba ang mga seks. Napakahalaga ng moralidad at tunay na tunay ang pag-dehenerasiya. Lahat ng mga kultura ay hindi pantay-pantay at kami ay hindi obligadong isipin na sila ay. Ang tao ay isang nilalang na nahulog at mayroon pang mas higit sa buhay na ito kumpara sa materyalismong paugong. Sa pagtatapos, ang lahing puti ay napakahalaga, at ang sibilisasyon ay katangi-tangi. Ito ay ang Alt-Right.

Maliban sa anumang teorya nakakapag-unipika, subalit, may mas maliit pang kasunduan ng mga Alt-Right tungkol sa gol na gustong-gusto nilang matamasa na pinakapangunahin. Marami sa mga pangunahing ilaw nito ay may katangi-tanging pagkakahilig na libertaryano, pinaka matanyag yung nakapagpunta rito [^11], kahit na kung hindi sila mga 100%-e at hinding-hindi nag-a-a-identipika sa kanilang mga sarili sa ganoon. Lahat ng mga maka-Alt-Right ay lumitaw lang rito, para sa instansyang, na naging pamilyar kay Rothbard at sa kanyang ginawa, sa lahat ng panahon ang pinaka-kamakailang kandidato sa pagkapresidente sa Partido ng Libertaryano ay hinding-hindi nakapagdinig sa pangalan ni Rothbard, at silang lahat, sa kahusayan ng kanilang mga natutunan, ay mga prangkang mga taga suporta ni Ron Paul sa panahon ng kanyang kampanyang pamprimarya sa nominasyon sa Partido ng Republikano bilang kandidato sa pagka-presidente, sa lahat ng pagkakataon maraming pansariling-pagproklamang mga libertaryano ang umatake at sumubok na sirain si Ron Paul para sa kanyang pinapalagay na - sa ngayon ikaw ay may alam na sa kung ano ang paparatingan - ang mga pananaw ng mga "rasista".

Subalit, marami sa mga lider ng mga maka-Alt-Right at marami sa kanilang mga ranggo at payl na mga tagapagsunod ay nakapag-endorso ng mga pananaw na hindi talaga bumabagay sa libertaryanismo. Kay Buchanan na mas nauna pa at kay Trump ngayon, sila ay may matibay na pang-pakomplemyento ng isang restriktibong polisiya, napaka-selektibong at nakapadiskriminadong immigrasyo [^12] na may matinding polisiya sa kalakalang restriktado, proteksyonismo pangekonomiko at mga taripang protektibo[^13].[^14]

May mga ibang tao ang naligaw kahit na sa kaulaunan, kagaya ni Richard Spencer, na siyang unang nakapagpasikat sa terminong Makakanang-Alt. Sa pansamatalang, may utang na loob sa iilang mga kamakailang mga istunt pampublisidad, na kung saan nakapaglikom sa kaniya ng iilang mga degree sa pagkakanotoriyedad sa US, si Spencer ay nakapaglatag sa kanyang pahayag sa mga ranggo ng mga lider na maksimo ng isang pinaniniwalaang napakamalakas na kilusang nagkakaisa[^15]. Noong si Spencer ay nagpakita dito, mga ilang mga taon na ang nakaraan, ipinalabas pa rin niya ang kanyang matibay na pagkakahilig sa libertaryano. Sa kasamaang palad, ganun pa man, ito ay nagbago at sa ngayon binabatikos na ito ni Spencer, nang walang anumang kwalipikasyong kahit anu paman, lahat ng mga libertaryano at lahat ng mga bagay na pang-libertaryano at sa ngayon ito ay nailalagay kasama ang sosyalismo, hangga't ito parin ay sosyalismo ng at para lamang sa mga puting mga tao. What horrifying disappointment!

Given the lack of any theoretical foundation, this split of the Alt-Right movement into rival factions can hardly be considered a surprise. Yet this fact should not mislead one to dismiss it, because the Alt-Right has brought out many insights that are of central importance in approaching an answer to the two previously mentioned questions unanswered by libertarian theory: of how to maintain a libertarian social order and how to get to such an order from the current, decidedly un-libertarian status quo. The Alt-Right did not discover these insights. They had been established long before and indeed, in large parts they are no more than common sense. But in recent times such insights have been buried under mountains of egalitarian, leftist propaganda and the Alt-Right must be credited for having brought them back to light.

To illustrate the importance of such insights, let me take the first unanswered question first.

Many libertarians hold the view that all that is needed to maintain a libertarian social order is the strict enforcement of the non-aggression principle (NAP). Otherwise, as long as one abstains from aggression, according to their view, the principle of “live and let live” should hold. Yet surely, while this “live and let live” sounds appealing to adolescents in rebellion against parental authority and all social convention and control[^16], and while the principle does indeed hold and apply for people living far apart and dealing with each other only indirectly and from afar, it does *not* hold and apply, or rather it is *insufficient*, when it comes to people living in close proximity to each other, as neighbors and cohabitants of the same community.

A simple example suffices to make the point. Assume a new next-door neighbor. This neighbor does not aggress against you or your property in any way, but he is a “bad” neighbor. He is littering on his own neighboring property, turning it into a garbage heap; in the open, for you to see, he engages in ritual animal slaughter, he turns his house into a “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with clients coming and going all day and all night long; he never offers a helping hand and never keeps any promise that he has made; or he cannot or else he refuses to speak to you in your own language. Etc., etc.. Your life is turned into a nightmare. Yet you may not use violence against him, because he has not aggressed against you. What can you do? You can shun and ostracize him. But your neighbor does not care, and in any case you alone thus ‘punishing’ him makes little if any difference to him. You have to have the communal respect and authority, or you must turn to someone who does, to persuade and convince everyone or at least most of the members of your community to do likewise and make the bad neighbor a social outcast, so as to exert enough pressure on him to sell his property and leave.

The lesson? The peaceful cohabitation of neighbors and of people in regular direct contact with each other on some territory – a tranquil, convivial social order – requires also a commonality of culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. There can be peaceful co-existence of different cultures on distant, physically separated territories, but multi-culturalism, cultural heterogeneity, cannot exist in one and the same place and territory without leading to diminishing social trust, increased tension, and ultimately the call for a “strong man” and the destruction of anything resembling a libertarian social order.

And moreover: Just as a libertarian order must always be on guard against “bad” (even if non-aggressive) neighbors by means of social ostracism, i.e., by a common “you are *not* welcome here” culture, so, and indeed even more vigilantly so, must it be guarded against neighbors who openly advocate communism, socialism, syndicalism or democracy in any shape or form. They, in thereby posing an open threat to all private property and property owners, must not only be shunned, but they must, to use a by now somewhat famous Hoppe-meme, be “physically removed,” if need be by violence, and forced to leave for other pastures. Not to do so inevitably leads to – well, communism, socialism, syndicalism or democracy and hence, the very opposite of a libertarian social order.

With these “rightist” or as I would say, plain commonsensical insights in mind I turn now to the more challenging question of how to move from here, the *status quo*, to there. And for this it might be instructive to first briefly consider the answer given by the liberallala, the peace-love-and-liberty, the Friede-Freude-Eierkuchen or the capitalism-is-love libertarians. It reveals the same fundamental egalitarianism, if in a slightly different form, as that exhibited also by the live-and-let-live libertarians. These, as I have just tried to show, define what we may call the “bad neighbor problem” – and what is merely a short-hand for the general problem posed by the co-existence of distinctly different, alien, mutually disturbing, annoying, strange or hostile cultures – simply out of existence. And indeed, if you assume, against all empirical evidence, that all people, everywhere, are essentially the same, then, by definition, no such thing as a “bad neighbor problem” exists.

The same egalitarian, or as the liberallala-libertarians themselves prefer call it, “humanitarian” spirit also comes to bear in their answer to the question of a libertarian *strategy*. In a nutshell, their advice is this: be nice and talk to everyone – and then, in the long run, the better libertarian arguments will win out. To illustrate, take my former-friend-turned-foe Jeffrey Tucker’s five “Don’ts When Talking Liberty.” They are:

1. don’t be belligerent;
2. don’t presume hatred of liberty; 
3. don’t presume different goals;
4. don’t presume ignorance;
5. don’t regard anyone as an enemy.”

Now, quite apart from the fact that Tucker does not seem to follow his own advice in his belligerent condemnation of the entire Alt-Right as liberty-hating fascists, I find his exhortations truly astounding. They may be good advice vis-à-vis people just sprung up from nowhere, without any traceable history whatsoever, but vis-à-vis real people with a recorded history they strike me as hopelessly naïve, unrealistic, and outright counterproductive in the pursuit of libertarian ends. For I (and I assume everyone else here) know of and have met many people in my life who *are* ignorant, who *do* have different, un-libertarian goals, and who *do* hate liberty as understood by libertarians – and why in the world should I *not* regard such people as fools or enemies? And why should I *not* hate and *not* be belligerent vis-a-vis my enemies?

As a libertarian strategy, then, Tucker’s advice must be considered simply a bad joke. But surely it is good advice if one seeks entry into the State as some sort of “libertarian” advisor, and this may well explain the enthusiasm with which Tucker’s “humanitarian” libertarianism has been embraced by the entire liberallala-libertarian crowd.

Outside egalitarian phantasy lands, however, in the real world, libertarians must above all be *realistic* and recognize from the outset, as the Alt-Right does, the inequality not just of individuals but also of different cultures as an ineradicable *datum* of the human existence. We must further recognize that there exist plenty of enemies of liberty as defined by libertarianism and that they, not we, are in charge of worldly affairs; that in many parts of the contemporary world their control of the populace is so complete that the ideas of liberty and of a libertarian social order are practically unheard of or considered unthinkable[^18]; and that it is essentially only in the West, in the countries of Western and Central Europe and the lands settled by its people, that the idea of liberty is so deeply rooted that these enemies still can be openly challenged. And confining our strategic considerations here only to the West, then, we can identify, pretty much as the Alt-Right has effectively done, these actors and agencies as our principal enemies.

They are:

1. The ruling elites in control of the State apparatus and in particular the “Deep State” or the so-called “Cathedral” of the military, the secret services, the central banks and the supreme courts. As well, they include: 
    1. The leaders of the military-industrial complex, i.e., of nominally private firms that owe their very existence to the State as the exclusive or dominant buyer of their products;
    2. The leaders of the big commercial banks, which owe their privilege of creating money and credit out of thin air to the existence of the central bank and its role as a “lender of last resort”. They together, then, State, Big-Business and Big-Banking, form an extremely powerful even if tiny “mutual admiration society,” jointly ripping off the huge mass of tax-payers and living it up big time at their expense.
2. ([A] much larger group of enemies is made up of) the intellectuals, educators and “educrats,” from the highest levels of academia down to the level of elementary schools and kindergartens. Funded almost exclusively, whether directly or indirectly, by the State, they, in their overwhelming majority, have become the soft tools and willing executioners in the hands of the ruling elite and its designs for absolute power and total control.
3. The journalists of the MSM, as the docile products of the system of “public education,” and the craven recipients and popularizers of government “information.”

Equally important in the development of a libertarian strategy then is the immediately following next question: who are the *victims*? The standard libertarian answer to this is: the tax-*payers* as opposed to the tax-*consumers*. Yet while this is essentially correct, it is at best only part of the answer, and libertarians could learn something in this respect from the Alt-Right: because apart from the narrowly economic aspect there is also a wider cultural aspect that must be taken into account in identifying the victims.

In order to expand and increase its power, the ruling elites have been conducting for many decades what Pat Buchanan has identified as a systematic “culture war,” aimed at a trans-valuation of all values and the destruction of all natural, or if you will “organic” social bonds and institutions such as families, communities, ethnic groups and genealogically related nations, so as to create an increasingly atomized populace, whose only shared characteristic and unifying bond is its common existential dependency on the State. The first step in this direction, taken already half a century or even longer ago, was the introduction of “public welfare” and “social security.” Thereby, the underclass and the elderly were turned into State-dependents and the value and importance of family and community was correspondingly diminished and weakened. More recently, further-reaching steps in this direction have proliferated. A new “victimology” has been proclaimed and promoted. Women, and in particular single mothers, Blacks, Browns, Latinos, homosexuals, lesbians, bi- and transsexuals have been awarded “victim” status and accorded legal privileges through non-discrimination or affirmative action decrees. As well, most recently such privileges have been expanded also to foreign-national immigrants, whether legal or illegal, insofar as they fall into one of the just mentioned categories or are members of non-Christian religions such as Islam, for instance. The result? Not only has the earlier mentioned “bad neighbor problem” not been avoided or solved, but systematically promoted and intensified instead. Cultural homogeneity has been destroyed, and the freedom of association, and the voluntary physical segregation and separation of different people, communities, cultures and traditions has been replaced by an all-pervasive system of forced social integration. Moreover, each mentioned “victim” group has thus been pitted against every other, and all of them have been pitted against white, heterosexual, Christian males and in particular those married and with children as the only remaining, legally un-protected group of alleged “victimizers.” Hence, as the result of the trans-valuation of all values promoted by the ruling elites, the world has been turned upside down. The institution of a family household with father, mother and their children that has formed the basis of Western civilization, as the freest, most industrious, ingenious and all-around accomplished civilization known to mankind, i.e., the very institution and people that has done most good in human history, has been officially stigmatized and vilified as the source of all social ills and made the most heavily disadvantaged, even persecuted group by the enemy elites’ relentless policy of *divide et impera*.

Accordingly, given the present constellation of affairs, then, any promising libertarian strategy must, very much as the Alt-Right has recognized:

1. Be tailored and addressed to this group of the most severely victimized people. White married Christian couples with children, in particular if they belong also to the class of tax-*payers* (rather than tax-consumers), and everyone most closely resembling or aspiring to this standard form of social order and organization can be realistically expected to be the most receptive audience of the libertarian message[^19]. Given this constellation of perpetrator-enemies vs. victims in the contemporary West, then, I can now come to the final task of trying to outline a realistic libertarian strategy for change. The specifics of which will have to be prefaced by two general considerations. For one, given that the class of intellectuals from the tops of *academia* to the opinion-molding journalists in the MSM are funded by and firmly tied into the ruling system, i.e., that they are a part of the *problem*, they also should not be expected to play a major if any role in the problem’s *solution*. Accordingly, the so-called Hayekian strategy for social change, that envisions the spread of correct libertarian ideas starting at the top, with the leading philosophers, and then trickling down from there to journalists and finally to the great unwashed masses, must be considered fundamentally unrealistic. Instead, any realistic libertarian strategy for change must be a *populist* strategy. That is, libertarians must short-circuit the dominant intellectual elites and address the masses directly to arouse their indignation and contempt for the ruling elites.
2. All the while the main addressees of a populist libertarian message must be indeed the just mentioned groups of dispossessed and disenfranchised native whites, I believe it to be a serious strategic error to make “whiteness” the exclusive criterion on which to base one’s strategic decisions, as some strands of the Alt-Right have suggested to do. After all, it is above all white men that make up the ruling elite and that have foisted the current mess upon us. True enough, the various protected “minorities” mentioned before take full advantage of the legal privileges they have been accorded and they have become increasingly emboldened to ask for ever more “protection,” but none of them and all of them together did not and do not possess the intellectual prowess that would have made this outcome possible, if it were not for the instrumental help that they received and are receiving from white men.

Now, taking our cues from the Buchanan-, the Paul- and the Trump-movement, on to the specifics of a populist strategy for libertarian change, in no specific order except for the very first one, which has currently assumed the greatest urgency in the public mind.

#### Stop mass immigration

The waves of immigrants currently flooding the Western world have burdened it with hordes of welfare parasites, brought in terrorists, increased crime, led to the proliferation of no-go areas and resulted in countless “bad neighbors” who, based on their alien upbringing, culture and traditions, lack any understanding and appreciation of liberty and are bound to become mindless future supporters of welfare-Statism.

No one is against immigration and immigrants *per se*. But immigration must be by invitation only. All immigrants must be productive people and hence, be barred from all domestic welfare payments. To ensure this, they or their inviting party must place a bond with the community in which they are to settle, and which is to be forfeited and lead to the immigrant’s deportation should he ever become a public burden. As well, every immigrant, inviting party or employer should not only pay for the immigrant’s upkeep or salary, but must also pay the residential community for the additional wear and tear of its public facilities associated with the immigrant’s presence, so as to avoid the socialization of any and all costs incurred with his settlement. Moreover, even before his admission, every potential immigrant invitee must be carefully screened and tested not only for his productivity but also for cultural affinity (or “good neighborliness”) – with the empirically predictable result of mostly, but by no means exclusively, western-white immigrant-candidates. And any known communist or socialist, of any color, denomination or country of origin, must be barred from permanent settlement – unless, that is, the community where the potential immigrant wants to settle officially sanctions the looting of its residents’ property by new, foreign arrivals, which is not very likely to say the least (even within already existing ‘commie’ communes).[^20]

#### Stop attacking, killing and bombing people in foreign countries

A main cause, even if by no means the only one, for the current invasion of Western countries by hordes of alien immigrants, are the wars initiated and conducted in the Middle East and elsewhere by the US’ ruling elites and their subordinate Western puppet-elites. As well, the by now seemingly ‘normal’ and ubiquitous terrorist attacks in the name of Islam across the Western world are in large measure the “blow-back” of these wars and the ensuing chaos throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa. There should be no hesitation to call these Western rulers what they are: murderers or accessories to mass murder. We must demand, and cry out loud instead for a foreign policy of strict non-interventionism. Withdraw from all international and supranational organizations such as the UN, NATO and the EU that intricate one country into the domestic affairs of another. Stop all government-to-government aid and prohibit all weapon sales to foreign States. Let it be *America First!, England First!, Germany First!, Italy First!*, and so on, i.e., each country trading with one another and no one interfering in anyone else’s domestic affairs.

#### Defund the ruling elites and its intellectual bodyguards

Expose and widely publicize the lavish salaries, perks, pensions, side-deals, bribes and hush monies received by the ruling elites: by the higher-ups in government and governmental bureaucracies, of supreme courts, central banks, secret services and spy agencies, by politicians, parliamentarians, party leaders, political advisors and consultants, by crony-capitalists, “public educrats,” university presidents, provosts and academic “stars.” Drive home the point that all their shining glory and luxury is funded by money extorted from tax-payers, and consequently urge that any and all taxes be slashed: income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, inheritance taxes, etc., etc..

#### End the FED and all central banks

The second source of funding for the ruling elites, besides the money extorted from the public in the form of taxes, comes from the central banks. Central banks are allowed to create paper money out of thin air. This reduces the purchasing power of money and destroys the savings of average people. It does not and cannot make society as a whole richer, but it redistributes income and wealth within society. The earliest receivers of the newly created money, i.e., the ruling elites, are thereby made richer and the later and latest receivers, i.e., the average citizen, are made poorer. The central bank’s manipulation of interest rates is the cause of boom-bust cycles. The central bank permits the accumulation of ever greater “public debt” that is shifted as a burden onto unknown future taxpayers or is simply inflated away. And as the facilitator of public debt, the central banks are also the facilitators of wars. This monstrosity must end and be replaced by a system of free, competitive banking built on the foundation of a genuine commodity money such as gold or silver.

#### Abolish all ‘affirmative action’ and ‘non-discrimination’ laws and regulations

All such edicts are blatant violations of the principle of the equality before the law that, at least in the West, is intuitively sensed and recognized as a fundamental principle of justice. As private property owners, people must be free to associate or disassociate with others: to include or exclude, to integrate or segregate, to join or separate, to unify and incorporate or to disunite, exit and secede. Close all university departments for Black-, Latino-, Women-, Gender-, Queer-Studies, etc., etc., as incompatible with science and dismiss its faculties as intellectual imposters or scoundrels. As well, demand that all affirmative action commissars, diversity and human resources officers, from universities on down to schools and kindergartens, be thrown out onto the street and be forced to learn some useful trade.

#### Crush the “Anti-Fascist” Mob

The trans-valuation of all values throughout the West: the invention of ever more “victim groups,” the spread of “affirmative action” programs and the relentless promotion of “political correctness,” has led to the rise of an “anti-fascist” mob. Tacitly supported and indirectly funded by the ruling elites, this self-described mob of “social justice warriors” has taken upon itself the task of escalating the fight against “white privilege” through deliberate acts of terror directed against anyone and anything deemed “racist,” “right-wing,” “fascist,” “reactionary,” “incorrigible” or “unreconstructed.” Such “enemies of progress” are physically assaulted by the “anti-fascist” mob, their cars are burnt down, their properties vandalized, and their employers threatened to dismiss them and ruin their careers – all the while the police are ordered by the powers that be to “stand down” and not to investigate the crimes committed or prosecute and punish the criminals. In view of this outrage, public anger must be aroused and there must be clamoring, far and wide, for the police to be unleashed and this mob be beaten into submission.[^21]

#### Crush the street criminals and gangs

In dispensing with the principle of the equality before the law and awarding all sorts of group privileges (except to the one group of married white Christian men and their families) the ruling elites have also dispensed with the principle of equal punishment for equal crime. Some State-favored groups are handed more lenient punishment for the same crime than others, and some especially favored groups are simply let run wild and go practically unpunished at all, thus actually and effectively promoting crime. As well, no-go areas have been permitted to develop where any effort at law-enforcement has essentially ceased to exist and where violent thugs and street gangs have taken over. In view of this, public furor must be provoked and it be unmistakably demanded that the police crack-down quick and hard on any robber, mugger, rapist and murderer, and ruthlessly clear all current no-go areas of violent gang-rule. Needless to say that this policy should be colorblind, but if it happens to be, as it in fact does, that most street criminals or gang members are young Black or Latino males or, in Europe, young immigrant males from Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans or Eastern Europe, then so be it and such human specimen then should be the ones that most prominently get their noses bloodied. And needless to say also that in order to defend against crime, whether ordinary street crime or acts of terrorism, all prohibitions against the ownership of guns by upstanding citizen should be abolished.

#### Get rid of all welfare parasites and bums

To cement their own position, the ruling class has put the underclass on the dole and thus made it a most reliable source of public support. Allegedly to help people rise and move up from the underclass to become self-supporting actors, the real – and actually intended – effect of the State’s so-called “social policy” is the exact opposite. It has rendered a person’s underclass status more permanent and made the underclass steadily grow (and with this also the number of tax-funded social workers and therapists assigned to “help and assist” it). For, in accordance with inexorable economic law, every subsidy awarded on account of some alleged need or deficiency produces more, not less, of the problem that it is supposed to alleviate or eliminate. Thus, the root cause of a person’s underclass status: his low impulse control and high time preference, i.e., his uncontrolled desire for immediate gratification, and the various attendant manifestations of this cause, such as unemployment, poverty, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, divorce, female headed households, out-of-wedlock births, rotating shack-up male companions, child abuse, negligence and petty crime, is and are not alleviated or eliminated but systematically strengthened and promoted. Instead of continuing and expanding this increasingly unsightly social disaster, then, it should be abolished and be loudly demanded that one take heed of the biblical exhortation that he who can, but will not work, also shall not eat, and that he who truly cannot work, due to severe mental or physical deficiencies, be taken care of by family, community and voluntary charity.

#### Get the State out of education

Most, if not all, social pathologies plaguing the contemporary West have their common root in the institution of “public education.” When the first steps were taken, more than two centuries ago, in Prussia, to supplement and ultimately replace a formerly completely private system of education with a universal system of compulsory “public education,” the time spent in State-run schools did in most cases not exceed four years. Today, throughout the entire Western world, the time spent in institutions of “public education” is, at a minimum, around ten years, and in many cases, and increasingly so, twenty or even thirty years. That is, a large or even the largest part of time during the most formative period in a person’s life is spent in State-funded and State-supervised institutions, whose primary purpose from the very beginning it was *not* to raise an enlightened public, but to train “good soldiers” and “good public servants:” not independent and mature or “mündige Bürger,” but subordinate and servile “Staats-Bürger.” The result? The indoctrination has worked: the longer the time a person has spent within the system of public education, the more he is committed to leftist-egalitarian ideas and has swallowed and wholeheartedly internalized the official doctrine and agenda of “political correctness.” Indeed, in particular among social science teachers and professors, people *not* counting themselves as part of the Left have practically ceased to exist. Consequently, it must be demanded that the control of schools and universities be wrest away from the central State and, in a first step, be returned to regional or better still local and locally funded authorities, and ultimately be completely privatized, so as to replace a system of compulsory uniformity and conformity with a system of decentralized education that reflects the natural variation, multiplicity and diversity of human talents and interests.

#### Don’t put your trust in politics or political parties

Just as *academia* and the academic world cannot be expected to play any significant role in a libertarian strategy for social change, so with politics and political parties – after all, it is the ultimate goal of libertarianism to put an end to all politics, and to subject all interpersonal relations and conflicts to private law and civil law procedures. To be sure, under present, all-pervasively politicized conditions an involvement in politics and party politics cannot be entirely avoided. However, in any such involvement one must be keenly aware of and guard against the corrupting influence of power and the lure of money and perks that comes with it. And to minimize this risk and temptation, it is advisable to concentrate one’s efforts on the level of regional and local rather than national politics, and there to promote a radical agenda of decentralization: of nullification and peaceful separation, segregation and secession. Most importantly, however, we must take heed of Ludwig von Mises’ life-motto: Do not give in to evil, but proceed ever more boldly against it. That is, we must speak out whenever and wherever, whether in formal or informal gatherings, against anyone affronting us with by now only all-too-familiar “politically correct” drivel and left-egalitarian balderdash and unmistakably say: “No. Hell no. You must be kidding.” In the meantime, given the almost complete mind-control exercised by the ruling elites, *academia* and the MSM, it already requires a good portion of courage to do so. But if we are not brave enough to do so now and thus set an example for others to follow, matters will become increasingly worse and more dangerous in the future, and we, Western civilization and the Western ideas of freedom and liberty will be wiped out and vanish.

[^20]: Brief message to all open-border and liberallala libertarians, who will surely label this, you guessed it, “fascist”: In a fully privatized libertarian order there exists no such thing as a right to free immigration. Private property implies borders and the owner’s right to exclude at will. And “public property” has borders as well. It is not unowned. It is the property of domestic tax-payers and most definitely not the property of foreigners. And while it is true that the State is a criminal organization and that to entrust it with the task of border control will inevitably result in numerous injustices to both domestic residents and foreigners, it is also true that the State *does something* also when it decides *not* to do anything about border control and that, under the present circumstances, doing nothing at all in this regard will lead to even more and much graver injustices, in particular to the domestic citizenry.

[^21]: Query for liberallala-libertarians and the Stupids for Liberty, who are sure to object to this demand on the ground that the police asked to crush the “anti-fascist” mob are *State-_police: Do you also object, on the same grounds, that the police arrest murderers or rapists? Aren’t these legitimate tasks performed also in any libertarian order by _private* police? And if the police are not to do anything about this mob, isn’t it o.k. then that the target of its attacks, the “racist Right,” should take the task upon itself of giving the “social justice warriors” a bloody nose?
