 Ang Iba't ibang Mas Pinagmulan na Pag-uugali
 
Bilang resulta ng mga argumento sa itaas, makikita natin na imposible na pumasok sa anumang debate nang hindi tinatanggap ang saligan na ang ilang mga pag-uugali ay *mas maganda sa buong mundo*.

Ginagamit ko ang salitang "pag-uugali" rito sa halip na "pag-iisip" sapagkat mahalaga ang pagkakaiba sa pagitan ng panloob at hindi maitutuwid na mga estado tulad ng "pag-iisip" mula sa mga layunin at napapatunayan na mga estado tulad ng "kumikilos," "pagsulat" at "pagsasalita."

Ito ay imposible upang patunayan na pinangarap ko ang isang elepante kagabi. Posible upang patunayan na isinulat ko ang salitang "elepante," kaya nga ginagamit ko ang salitang "pag-uugali" sa halip na "pag-iisip."

Ang pagkilala sa superior logic sa isang argumento ay isang *pagkilos*. Kung, sa tuwing nakikiusap ako sa iyo ng isang punto sa iyo, wala akong sinabi, ngunit sa halip ay tinitigan mo na lamang, masusumpungan mo ito sa halip na magagalit sa pagtatalo sa akin. Upang makamit ang isang punto, dapat kong gawin ang pagkilos ng pandiwang pagtanggap.

Sa gayon ay makikita na, ang likas na pagkilos sa pag-aresto ay isang bilang ng mga naka-embed na lugar na hindi maaaring maiiwasang maibalik.

Kung hihilingin ko sa iyo na makilala ako sa tennis court, at magpakita ng isang rifle ng pangangaso, maaari tayong mag-play ng isang uri ng sport, ngunit tiyak na hindi ito magiging tennis. Kapag hiniling ko sa iyo na makilala ako sa tennis court para sa isang laro, ang pahayag sa kahilingan na iyon ay isang pagtanggap sa mga panuntunan ng tennis.

Sa kasaysayan, ang mga nakikipag-debate sa etika ay madalas na nabigo upang mapanatili ang batayang katotohanang ito

Hindi ako maaaring magsumite ng isang pang-agham na papel na isinulat sa sarili kong sariling wika, na nag-aangkin na ito ay sinisi ng aking saykiko na goldpis, at inaasahan na maging seryoso. Sa katulad na paraan, hindi ako makapagsimula ng isang pilosopiko na debate sa etika sa pagtukoy sa aking sariling mga personal na halaga, at sinasabing ang lahat ng aking mga argumento ay napatunayan ni Trixie ang marunong at alam na leprechaun, at inaasahan na maging seryoso.

Ang tunay na pagkilos ng debating ay nangangailangan ng pagtanggap ng pag-uugali ng universally preferable (UPB). Walang paraan upang makatugon sa isang makatwirang argumento *nang walang* exhibiting UPB.

Ipaalam sa amin ngayon sa isang serye ng mga positibong patunay para sa UPB.

UPB at Bisa

Ang isa sa mga sentral na hamon na nahaharap sa mga modernong pilosopo ay ang pangangailangan na patunayan na ang mga alituntunin sa moral ay parehong posible at unibersal. Hanggang sa ang mga patakaran ng moral ay maaring mapasailalim sa parehong hirap at lohika tulad ng anumang iba pang mga proposisyon, magpakailanman ay maiiwasan tayo ng subjectivism, pampulitikang pagkiling at ang praktiko "argumento mula sa epekto."

Ang pinakamalapit na pagkakatulad sa kasaysayan sa ating kasalukuyang sitwasyon ay nangyari sa ikalabinlimang at labing-anim na siglo, sa panahon ng pagtaas ng pang-agham na pamamaraan. Ang mga naunang pioneer na nagtataguyod ng isang makatuwiran at praktikal na diskarte sa kaalaman ay nakaharap sa parehong mga prejudices na kinakaharap natin ngayon - lahat ng parehong mga irrationalities, entrenched kapangyarihan ng simbahan at estado, mistiko sa pansarili "ganap" at unang bahagi ng mga hadlang sa edukasyon. Yaong mga nagtaguyod ng kahalagahan ng pagkamakatwiran at pagmamasid sa obserbasyon sa pundamentalismo ng Krismas at sa mga sekular na tyrannies ay nahaharap sa determinadong pagsalungat sa mga naghawak ng parehong krus at tabak. Marami ang pinahirapan sa kamatayan dahil sa kanilang intelektwal na katapatan - mas nakakaapekto tayo sa panganib, at dapat maging mas matapang sa pagtataguyod kung ano ang totoo sa kung ano ang pinaniniwalaan.

Upang ma-atake ang mga maling moralidad, kailangan naming magsimula sa simula, tulad ng ginawa ng mga unang siyentipiko. Hindi sinalungat ni Francis Bacon na ang pang-agham na pamamaraan ay mas "mabisa" kaysa sa panalangin, mga teksto ng Bibliya o mga pangitain na hinimok ng gutom. Sinabi lamang niya na kung nais nating maunawaan ang kalikasan, dapat nating obserbahan ang kalikasan at lohikal na makatotohanang - at walang ibang ruta na malaman.

Dapat nating gawin ang parehong diskarte sa pagtukoy at pakikipag-usap *moralidad*. Dapat nating umpisahan ang paggamit ng kapangyarihan at pagiging lehitimo ng pang-agham na pamamaraan upang patunayan ang pagiging wasto at pangkalahatan ng mga batas sa moralidad. Dapat tayong magsimula mula sa umpisa, lohikal na itayo at tanggihan ang *anumang* hindi makatwiran o di-empirikal na mga pamalit para sa katotohanan.

Ano ang hitsura nito sa pagsasanay? Ang kailangan lang nating gawin ay itatag ang sumusunod na mga axiom:

- Ang moralidad ay isang wastong konsepto.
- Ang mga patakaran ng moral ay dapat na maging pare-pareho para sa lahat ng sangkatauhan.
- Ang bisa ng isang moral na teorya ay hinuhusgahan ng pagkakapare-pareho nito.

Upang simulan mula pa sa simula ... ang mga tuntunin ng moralidad - o higit na napapakinabangan ng mga pag-uugali ng tao - wasto sa lahat?

Mayroong dalawang mga posibilidad lamang pagdating sa mga patakaran ng moral, tulad ng sa anumang lohikal na agham. Ang alinman sa mga alituntunin sa moral na unibersal ay may bisa, o hindi. [^ 6]

Ang isang panuntunan ay maaaring balido kung may *empirically*, tulad ng gravity, o dahil ito ay *tama*, tulad ng ekwasyon na dalawa dagdagan ng dalawa na ang katumbas ng apat.

Dapat nating itanong muna: ang umiiral ba na moral na mga tuntunin?

Tiyak na hindi sa materyal na katotohanan, na hindi naglalaman o sumunod sa isang moral na tuntunin. Iba't ibang mga panuntunan sa moral ang mga tuntunin ng pisika, tulad ng kaibahan ng agham kaysa sa gravity. Ang mahalaga ay sumusunod sa gravity o ang ikalawang batas ng termodinamika, ngunit "hindi ka dapat pagpatay" ay wala pang nakasulat sa likas na katangian ng mga bagay. Ang mga pisikal na batas *ay naglalarawan* ng pag-uugali ng bagay, ngunit hindi naglalaman ng isang *reseta*. Sinasabi ng Science na ang bagay *ay* kumikilos sa isang tiyak na paraan - hindi na ito *dapat* kumilos sa isang tiyak na paraan. Ang teorya ng gravity ay nagpapatunay na kung itulak mo ang isang tao mula sa isang talampas, siya ay mahuhulog. Hindi ito sasabihin sa iyo kung dapat mong itulak siya o hindi.

Kaya hindi maaaring sabihin na ang moral na mga tuntunin ay umiiral sa materyal na katotohanan, at hindi rin sila awtomatikong sinusunod tulad ng mga batas ng pisika - na hindi *nangangahulugan na ang mga batas sa moral ay hindi totoo, subjective o hindi nauugnay. Ang pang-agham na pamamaraan mismo ay hindi umiiral sa katotohanan alinman - at din opsyonal - ngunit ito ay hindi sa lahat ng mga maling, pansarili o walang katuturan.

Kung maaari naming patunayan na moral teorya ay maaaring maging layunin, makatuwiran at napapatunayan, ito ay magbibigay ng parehong mga benepisyo sa etika na paksa *pisikal* teoryang sa pang-agham na paraan ginawa.

Bago ang pagtaas ng pang-agham na pamamaraan, naniniwala ang mga tao na ang bagay ay sumunod sa mga subjective whims ng mga diyos at mga demonyo - at ang mga tao ay naniniwala sa parehong ng moralidad ngayon. Ang mga bulkan ay lumabas dahil ang galit ng bundok ay galit; Ang mga mabuting ani ay nagresulta mula sa mga sakripisyo ng tao o hayop. Walang sinuman ang naniniwala na ang ganap na pisikal na mga batas ay maaaring limitahan ang kalooban ng mga diyos - at sa gayon ang agham ay hindi maaaring bumuo. Ang mga historically profited mula sa pagtukoy sa pisikal na katotohanan bilang pansarili - karamihan sa mga pari at aristocrats - labanan ang pagsupil ng mga pisikal na teoryang sa pang-agham na paraan, tulad ng mga kasalukuyang kumikita mula sa pagtukoy sa moralidad bilang subjective - karamihan sa mga pari at mga pulitiko - kasalukuyang labanan ang pagsupil ng *moral* teorya sa layunin at unibersal na mga prinsipyo.

As mentioned above, the scientific method is essentially a methodology for separating accurate from inaccurate theories by subjecting them to two central tests: logical consistency and empirical observation – and by always subjugating logical consistency to empirical observation. If I propose a perfectly consistent and logical theory that says that a rock will float *up* when thrown off a cliff, any empirical test proves my theory incorrect, since observation always trumps hypothesis.

A further aspect of the scientific method is the belief that, since matter is composed of combinations of atoms with common, stable and predictable properties, the behaviour of matter must also be common, stable and predictable. Thus experiments must be *reproducible* in different locations and times. I cannot say that my “rock floating” theory is correct for just one particular rock, or on the day I first tested it, or at a single location. My theories must describe the behaviour of *matter*, which is universal, common, stable and predictable.

Finally, there is a generally accepted rule – sometimes called Occam’s Razor – which states that, of any two theories that have the same predictive power, the simpler of the two is preferable. Prior to the Copernican revolution, when Earth was considered the centre of the universe, the retrograde motion of Mars when Earth passed it in orbit around the sun caused enormous problems to the Ptolemaic system of astronomical calculations. “Circles within circles” multiplied enormously, which were all cleared away by simply placing the sun at the centre of the solar system and accepting the elliptical nature of planetary orbits.

Thus any valid scientific theory must be (a) universal (b) logical (c) empirically verifiable (d) reproducible and (e) as simple as possible.

The methodology for judging and proving a *moral* theory is exactly the same as the methodology for judging and proving any other theory.

#### Moral Rules: A Definition

The first question regarding moral rules is: *what* are they?

Simply put, *morals* are a set of rules claiming to accurately and consistently identify universally preferable human behaviours, just as *physics* is a set of rules claiming to accurately and consistently identify the universal behaviour of matter.

The second question to be asked is: is there any such thing as “universally preferable behaviour” at all? If there is, we can begin to explore what such behaviour might be. If not, then our examination must stop here – just as the examination of Ptolemaic astronomy ceased after it became commonly accepted that the Sun was in fact the centre of the solar system.

### UPB: Five Proofs

As we discussed above, the proposition that *there is no such thing as preferable behaviour* contains an insurmountable number of logical and empirical problems. “Universally preferable behaviour” *must* be a valid concept, for five main reasons.

The first is logical: if I argue *against* the proposition that universally preferable behaviour is valid, I have already shown my preference for truth over falsehood – as well as a preference for correcting those who speak falsely. Saying that there is no such thing as universally preferable behaviour is like shouting in someone’s ear that sound does not exist – it is innately self-contradictory. In other words, if there is *no such thing* as universally preferable behaviour, then one *should* oppose anyone who claims that there is such a thing as universally preferable behaviour. However, if one “should” do something, then one has just created universally preferable behaviour. Thus universally preferable behaviour – or moral rules – must be valid.

Syllogistically, this is:

1. The proposition is: the concept “universally preferable behaviour” must be valid.
2. Arguing against the validity of universally preferable behaviour demonstrates universally preferable behaviour.
3. Therefore no argument against the validity of universally preferable behaviour can be valid.

We all know that there are subjective preferences, such as liking ice cream or jazz, which are not considered binding upon other people. On the other hand, there are other preferences, such as rape and murder, which clearly *are* inflicted on others. There are also preferences for logic, truth and evidence, which are also binding upon others (although they are not usually violently inflicted) insofar as we all accept that an illogical proposition must be false or invalid.

Those preferences which can be considered binding upon others can be termed “universal preferences,” or “moral rules.”

How else can we know that the concept of “moral rules” is valid?

We can examine the question biologically as well as syllogistically.

For instance, all matter is subject to physical rules – and everything that lives is in addition subject to certain requirements, and thus, if it is alive, must have followed universally preferred behaviours. Life, for instance, requires fuel and oxygen. Any living mind, of course, is an organic part of the physical world, and so is subject to physical laws and must have followed universally preferred behaviours – to argue otherwise would require proof that consciousness is not composed of matter, and is not organic – an impossibility, since it has mass, energy, and life. Arguing that consciousness is subject to neither physical rules nor universally preferred behaviours would be like arguing that human beings are immune to gravity, and can flourish without eating.

Thus it is impossible that anyone can logically argue against universally preferable behaviour, since if he is alive to argue, he must have followed universally preferred behaviours such as breathing, eating and drinking.

Syllogistically, this is:

1. All organisms require universally preferred behaviour to live.
2. Man is a living organism.
3. Therefore all living men are alive due to the practice of universally preferred behaviour.
4. Therefore any argument against universally preferable behaviour requires an acceptance and practice of universally preferred behaviour.
5. Therefore no argument against the existence of universally preferable behaviour can be valid.

Since the scientific method requires empirical corroboration, we must also look to reality to confirm our hypothesis – and here the validity of universally preferable behaviour is fully supported.

Every sane human being believes in moral rules of some kind. There is some disagreement about what *constitutes* moral rules, but everyone is certain that moral rules are valid – just as many scientists disagree, but all scientists accept the validity of the scientific method itself. One can argue that the Earth is round and not flat – which is analogous to changing the definition of morality – but one cannot argue that the Earth does not exist at all – which is like arguing that there is no such thing as universally preferable behaviour.

Or:

1. For a scientific theory to be valid, it must be supported by empirical observation.
2. If the concept of “universally preferable behaviour” is valid, then mankind should believe in universally preferable behaviour.
3. All men believe in universally preferable behaviour.
4. Therefore empirical evidence exists to support the validity of universally preferable behaviour – and the existence of such evidence *opposes* the proposition that universally preferable behaviour is not valid.

The fourth argument for the validity of universally preferable behaviour is also empirical. Since human beings have an almost-infinite number of choices to make in life, to say that there are no principles of universally preferable behaviour would be to say that all choices are equal (i.e. subjective). However, all choices are *not* equal, either logically or through empirical observation.

For instance, if food is available, almost all human beings prefer to eat every day. When cold, almost all human beings seek warmth. Almost all parents choose to feed, shelter and educate their children. There are many examples of common choices among humankind, which indicate that universally preferable behaviour abounds and is part of human nature.

As mentioned above, no valid theory of physics can repudiate the simple fact that children can catch fly-balls – in the same way, no valid theory of ethics can reject the endless evidence for the acceptance of UPB.

Or:

1. Choices are almost infinite.
2. Most human beings make very similar choices.
3. Therefore not all choices can be equal.
4. Therefore universally preferable choices must be valid.

The fifth argument for the validity of universally preferable behaviour is evolutionary.

Since all organic life requires preferential behaviour to survive, we can assume that those organisms which make the most successful choices are the ones most often selected for survival.

Since man is the most successful species, and man’s most distinctive organ is his mind, it must be man’s *mind* that has aided him the most in making successful choices. The mind itself, then, has been selected as successful by its very ability to make successful choices. Since the human mind only exists as a *result* of choosing universally preferable behaviour, universally preferable behaviour must be a valid concept.

Or:

1. Organisms succeed by acting upon universally preferable behaviour.
2. Man is the most successful organism.
3. Therefore man must have acted most successfully on the basis of universally preferable behaviour.
4. Man’s mind is his most distinctive organ.
5. Therefore man’s mind must have acted most successfully on the basis of universally preferable behaviour.
6. Therefore universally preferable behaviour must be valid.

We could bring many more arguments to support the existence and validity of UPB, but we shall rest our case with the above, and move to an examination of the nature of UPB.

#### UPB: Optional And Objective

Since we have proven the validity of universally preferable behaviour, the question of morality now shifts. Since morality *is* valid, what theories can quantify, classify, explain and predict it?

First of all, we must remember that morality is clearly optional. Every man is subject to gravity and requires food to live, but no man has to act morally. If I rape, steal or kill, no thunderbolt strikes me down. Moral rules, like the scientific method or biological classifications, are merely ways of rationally organising facts and principles relative to objective reality.

The fact that compliance with moral rules is *optional*, however, has confused many thinkers into believing that morality itself is *subjective*. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Living organisms are part of material reality, and material reality is rational and objective. Applying moral theories is optional, but that does not mean that all moral theories are subjective. The scientific method is also optional, but it is not subjective. Applying biological classifications is optional, but biology is not subjective. Choices are optional; consequences are not. I can choose not to eat, but I cannot choose to live without eating. I can choose to behead someone, but I cannot choose whether or not they can live without a head. Morality is thus optional, but the *effects* of moral choices are measurable and objective.

Now, since morality is a valid concept, the next question is: to what degree or extent is morality valid?

As mentioned above, the first test of any scientific theory is *universality*. Just as a theory of physics must apply to *all* matter, a moral theory that claims to describe the preferable actions of mankind *must apply to **all** mankind*. No moral theory can be valid if it argues that a certain action is *right* in Syria, but *wrong* in San Francisco. It cannot say that Person A *must* do X, but Person B must *never* do X. It cannot say that what was *wrong* yesterday is *right* today – or vice versa. If it does, it is false and must be refined or discarded.

To be valid, any moral theory must also pass the criterion of *logical consistency*. Since the behaviour of matter is logical, consistent and predictable, all theories involving matter – either organic or inorganic – must also be logical, consistent and predictable. The theory of relativity cannot argue that the speed of light is both constant and not constant at the same time, or that it is one hundred eighty-six thousand kilometres per second, five kilometres in depth, and also green in colour.

However, since moral theories apply to mankind, and mankind is organic, the degree of *empirical* consistency required for moral theories is less than that required for *inorganic* theories. All rocks, for instance, must fall down, but not all horses have to be born with only one head. Biology includes three forms of “randomness,” which are environment, genetic mutation and free will. For example, poodles are generally friendly, but if beaten for years, will likely become aggressive. Horses are defined as having only one head, but occasionally, a two-headed mutant is born. Similarly, human beings generally prefer eating to starving – except anorexics. These exceptions do not bring down the entire science of biology. Thus, since moral theories describe mankind, they cannot be subjected to exactly the same requirements for consistency as theories describing inorganic matter.

The final test that any moral theory must pass is the criterion of empirical observation. For instance, a moral theory must explain the universal prevalence of moral beliefs among mankind, as well as the divergent results of human moral “experiments” such as fascism, communism, socialism or capitalism. It must also explain some basic facts about human society, such as the fact that state power always increases, or that propaganda tends to increase as state power increases. If it fails to explain the past, understand the present and predict the future, then it must be rejected as invalid.

#### UPB: The Practice

How does all this look in practice? Let’s look at how the requirement for *universality* affects moral theories. We shall touch here on proofs and disproofs for specific moral propositions, which we shall examine in more detail in Part Two.

If I say that gravity affects matter, it must affect *all* matter. If even one pebble proves immune to gravity, my theory is in trouble. If I propose a moral theory that argues that people should not murder, it must be applicable to *all* people. If certain people (such as soldiers) are exempt from that rule, then I have to either prove that soldiers are *not* people, or accept that my moral theory is false. There is no other possibility. On the other hand, if I propose a moral theory that argues that all people *should* murder, then I have saved certain soldiers, but condemned to evil all those *not* currently murdering someone (including those being murdered!) – which is surely incorrect.

If, to save the virtue of soldiers, I alter my theory to argue that it is moral for people to murder if someone else tells them to (a political leader, say), then I must deal with the problem of universality. If Politician A can order a soldier to murder an Iraqi, then the Iraqi must also be able to order the soldier to murder Politician A, and the soldier can also order Politician A to murder the Iraqi. The application of this theory results in a general and amoral paralysis, and thus is proven invalid.

I also cannot logically argue that is wrong for *some* people to murder, but right for *other* people to murder. Since all human beings share common physical properties and requirements, proposing one rule for one person and the *opposite* rule for another is invalid – it is like proposing a physics theory that says that some rocks fall down, while others fall up. Not only is it illogical, it contradicts an observable fact of reality, which is that human beings as a species share common characteristics, and so cannot be subjected to opposing rules. Biologists have no problems classifying certain organisms as “human” because they share common and easily identifiable characteristics – it is only moralists who seem to find this level of consistency impossible.

Furthermore, if my moral theory “proves” that the same man should not murder one day, but *should* murder the next day (say, when he steps out into the Iraqi desert), then my position is even more ludicrous. That would be equivalent to arguing that *one day a rock falls downward, and the next day it falls upward!* To call this any kind of consistent theory is to make madness sanity.

Since valid theories require *logical consistency*, a moral theory cannot be valid if it is both true and false at the same time. A moral theory that approves of stealing, for instance, faces an insurmountable logical problem. No moral theory should, if it is universally applied, directly eliminate behaviour it defines as moral while simultaneously creating behaviour it defines as *immoral*. If everyone *should* steal, then no one *will* steal – which means that the moral theory can never be practised. And *why* will no one steal? Well, because a man will only steal if he can *keep* the property he is stealing. He’s not going to bother stealing a wallet if someone else is going to immediately steal that wallet from him. Any moral theory proposing that “stealing is good” is also automatically invalid because it posits that property rights are both valid and invalid *at the same time*, and so fails the test of logical consistency. If I steal from you, I am saying that *your* property rights are invalid. However, I want to *keep* what I am stealing – and therefore I am saying that *my* property rights are valid. However, property rights cannot be both valid and invalid at the same time, and so this proposition itself must be invalid.

Similarly, any moral theory that advocates rape faces a similar contradiction. Rape can *never* be moral, since any principle that approves it automatically contradicts itself. If rape is justified on the principle that “taking pleasure is always good,” then such a principle immediately fails the test of logical consistency, since the rapist may be “taking pleasure,” but his victim certainly is *not*.[^7]

Thus subjecting moral theories to the scientific method produces results that conform to rationality, empirical observations and plain common sense. Murder, theft, arson, rape and assault are all proven immoral.[^8]

To aid in swallowing this rather large conceptual pill, below is a table that helps equate theories of physics and biology with scientific theories of universally preferable (or moral) behaviour:

Table: Theories of physics and biology and of UPB

In conclusion, it is safe to say that (a) moral rules are valid, and (b) moral theories must be subjected to the rigours of logic and evidence, just as theories of physics and biology are. Any moral theory based on non-universal or self-contradictory principles is demonstrably false.

#### UPB: The Framework

UPB can thus be seen as a framework for validating ethical theories or propositions – just as the scientific method is a framework that is used to validate scientific theories or propositions.

An example of a moral proposition is: “the initiation of the use of force is wrong.” UPB is the methodology that tests that proposition against both internal consistency and empirical observation. UPB thus first asks: *is the proposition logical and consistent?* UPB then asks: *what evidence exists for the truth of the proposition?*

To keep this book at a reasonable length, we will in general deal mostly with the first criterion of logical consistency. For the second criterion, we shall rely for evidence on the universal prohibitions across all cultures against certain actions such as rape, theft, assault and murder. Much more could be written on the historical evidence that helps support or reject various moral propositions, but we shall leave that for another time. If we establish the validity of UPB, we have achieved an enormous amount. If we do not, evidence will scarcely help us.

Let us now turn to the question of whether the UPB framework deals with matters of *ethics*, or *aesthetics*, or both.

[^6]: In physics, the question is: either universal physical rules are valid, or they are not.

[^7]: The same goes, of course, for murder and assault. We will be returning to these proofs – as well as a further examination of property rights – in more detail in Part Two of this book.

[^8]: Universal and positive moral rules can also be proven – i.e. the universal validity of property rights and non-violence – but we shall discuss that in Part Two.
