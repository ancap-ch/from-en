## Ang mga senaryo sa Lifeboat

Ang katotohanan na ang UPB ay nagpapatunay lamang ng lohikal na hindi nag-iibang mga teoryang moral ay hindi nangangahulugan na wala ng likhang isip na sirkumstansya kung saan pipiliin natin na kumilos *laban* sa simulain ng gayung teorya.

Halimbawa, kung tatanggapin natin ang unibersal na katuparan ng mga karapatan sa pag-aari, ang pagbasag ng tao sa bintana at paglukso sa isang kuwarto nang walang pahintulot ay isang paglabag sa kanyang mga karapatan sa pag-aari. Gayunpaman, kung nakabitin kami sa isang tagdan ng bandila sa labas ng bintana ng kuwarto, at tungkol sa mahulog sa aming kamatayan, ilan sa amin ay tanggihan upang sipain sa bintana at tumalon sa kaligtasan para sa pagsunod sa isang mahirap unawaing prinsipyo.

A totoong daigdig, kakailanganin ng taong tumitigas ang isang taong magpaparatang ng kaso laban sa isang taong nagwasak ng isang bintana upang mailigtas ang kanyang buhay - tulad ng kakailanganin ng isang di-mapagkakatiwalaang tao na tumangging bayaran ang pagbabayad ng paninda para sa nasabing bintana. Ang alituntunin ng "maiiwasan" ay gitnang dito - ang taong nakabitin sa isang tagdan ng bandila ay may maliit na pagpipilian tungkol sa pagsipa sa isang bintana. Ang isang tao na sumisira sa iyong bahay upang magnakaw ng mga bagay ay malinaw na may kakayahang maiwasan ang panghihimasok sa iyong ari-arian - hindi siya nababahala, ngunit sa halip ay ang *tagasimula* ng pagsalakay. Ito ay katulad ng pagkakaiba sa pagitan ng babae na may taong may manluko sa kanya, kumpara sa babae na ang lalaki ay nakakandado sa kanya sa silong.

Hindi ito dapat sabihin na ang pagsira sa bintana upang iligtas ang iyong buhay ay hindi mali. Ito ay, dahil ito ay isang mali na halos lahat sa atin ay pipili na mangako kaysa sa mamatay. Kung ako ay nasa gilid ng kamatayan dahil sa gutom, nais kong magnakaw ng isang mansanas. Ito ay hindi nangangahulugan na ito ay* tama* para sa akin ang nakawin ang mansanas -ito ay nangangahulugan lamang ginawa ko ito - at kailangang tangapin na makatarungan ang mga kahihinatnan ng aking pagnanakaw.[^10]

### Ang Lugar na Kulay Abo

Katunayan ang ilang mga " lugar na kulay abo" na umiiral sa larangan ng etika ay kadalasang ginagamit bilang isang pagbibigay-katwiran para sa ranggo relatibismo. Since on occasion some things remain unclear (e.g. who initiated the use of violence), and since it is impossible to define objective and exact rules for every conceivable situation, the conclusion is often drawn that nothing can *ever* be known for certain, and that no objective rules exist for *any* situation.

This is false.

All reasonable people recognise that biology is a valid science, despite the fact that some animals are born with “one-off” mutations. The fact that a dog can be born with five legs does not mean that “canine” becomes a completely subjective category. The fact that certain species of insects are challenging to differentiate does not mean that there is no difference between a beetle and a whale.

For some perverse reason, intellectuals in particular take great joy in the wanton destruction of ethical, normative and rational standards. This could be because intellectuals have so often been paid by corrupt classes of individuals such as politicians, priests and kings – or it could be that a man often becomes an intellectual in order to create justifications for his own immoral behaviour. Whatever the reason, most modern thinkers have become a species of “anti-thinker,” which is very odd. It would be equivalent to there being an enormous class of “biologists” who spent their entire lives arguing that the science of biology was impossible. If the science of biology is impossible, it scarcely makes sense to become a biologist, any more than an atheist should fight tooth and nail to become a priest.

### Shades Of Grey

In the realm of “grey areas,” there are really only three possibilities.

1. There are no such things as grey areas.
2. Certain grey areas do exist.
3. All knowledge is a grey area.

Clearly, option one can be easily discarded. Option three is also fairly easy to discard. The statement “all knowledge is a grey area” is a self-detonating proposition, as we have seen above, in the same way that “all statements are lies” also self-detonates.

Thus we must go with option two, which is that certain grey areas do exist, and we know that they are grey relative to the areas that are not grey Oxygen exists in space, and also underwater, but not in a form or quantity that human beings can consume. The *degree* of oxygenation is a grey area, i.e. “less versus more”; the question of whether or not human beings can breathe water is surely black and white.

A scientist captured by cannibals may pretend to be a witch-doctor in order to escape – this does not mean that we must dismiss the scientific method as entirely invalid.

Similarly, there can be extreme situations wherein we may choose to commit immoral actions, but such situations do not invalidate the science of morality, any more than occasional mutations invalidate the science of biology. In fact, the science of biology is greatly advanced through the acceptance and examination of mutations – and similarly, the science of ethics is only strengthened through an examination of “lifeboat scenarios,” as long as such an examination is not pursued obsessively.

### Universality And Exceptions

Before we start using our framework of Universally Preferable Behaviour to examine some commonly held ethical beliefs, we must deal with the question of “exceptions.”

Using the above “lifeboat scenarios,” the conclusion is often drawn that “the good” is simply *that which is “good” for an individual man’s life*.

In ethical arguments, if I am asked whether I would steal an apple rather than starve to death – and I say “yes” – the following argument is inevitably made:

1. Everyone would rather steal an apple than starve to death.
2. Thus everyone universally prefers stealing apples to death by starvation.
3. Thus it is *universally preferable* to steal apples rather than starve to death.
4. Thus survival is universally preferable to property rights.
5. Thus what is good for the individual is the ultimate moral standard.

This has been used as the basis for a number of ethical theories and approaches, from Nietzsche to Rand. The preference of each individual for survival is translated into ethical theories that place the survival of the individual at their centre.[^11]

This kind of “biological hedonism” may be a description of the “drive to survive,” but it is only correct insofar as it describes what people actually *do*, not what they *should* do.

It also introduces a completely unscientific subjectivism to the question of morality. For instance, if it is morally permissible to steal food when you are starving, how much food can you steal? How hungry do you have to be? Can you steal food that is not nutritious? How nutritious does the food have to be in order to justify stealing it? How long after stealing one meal are you allowed to steal another meal? Are you allowed to steal meals rather than look for work or appeal to charity?

Also, if I can make more money as a hit man than a shopkeeper, should I not pursue violence as a career? It certainly enhances *my* survival... and so on and so on.

As we can see, the introduction of “what is good for man in the abstract – or what most people do – is what is universally preferable” destroys the very concept of morality as a logically consistent theory, and substitutes mere biological drives as justifications for behaviour. It is an explanation of behaviour, not a proposed moral theory.

### The Purpose And The Dangers

With your patient indulgence, one final question needs to be addressed before we plunge into a definition and test how various moral propositions fit into the UPB framework. Since the hardest work lies ahead, we should pause for a moment and remind ourselves why we are putting ourselves through all this rigour and difficulty.

In other words, before we plunge on, it is well worth asking the question: “Why bother?”

Why bother with defining ethical theories? Surely good people don’t need them, and bad people don’t consult them. People will do what they prefer, and just make up justifications as needed after the fact – why *bother* lecturing people about morality?

Of course, the danger always exists that an immoral person will attack you for his own hedonistic purposes. It could also be the case that, despite clean and healthy living, you may be struck down by cancer before your time – the former does not make the science of morality irrelevant, any more than the latter makes the sciences of medicine, nutrition and exercise irrelevant. One demonstrable effect of a rational science of morality must be to reduce your chances of *suffering* immoral actions such as theft, murder and rape – and it is by this criterion that we shall also judge the moral rules proposed in Part Three of this book.
