### UPB: Five Proofs

As we discussed above, the proposition that *there is no such thing as preferable behaviour* contains an insurmountable number of logical and empirical problems. “Universally preferable behaviour” *must* be a valid concept, for five main reasons.

The first is logical: if I argue *against* the proposition that universally preferable behaviour is valid, I have already shown my preference for truth over falsehood – as well as a preference for correcting those who speak falsely. Saying that there is no such thing as universally preferable behaviour is like shouting in someone’s ear that sound does not exist – it is innately self-contradictory. In other words, if there is *no such thing* as universally preferable behaviour, then one *should* oppose anyone who claims that there is such a thing as universally preferable behaviour. However, if one “should” do something, then one has just created universally preferable behaviour. Thus universally preferable behaviour – or moral rules – must be valid.

Syllogistically, this is:

1. The proposition is: the concept “universally preferable behaviour” must be valid.
2. Arguing against the validity of universally preferable behaviour demonstrates universally preferable behaviour.
3. Therefore no argument against the validity of universally preferable behaviour can be valid.

We all know that there are subjective preferences, such as liking ice cream or jazz, which are not considered binding upon other people. On the other hand, there are other preferences, such as rape and murder, which clearly *are* inflicted on others. There are also preferences for logic, truth and evidence, which are also binding upon others (although they are not usually violently inflicted) insofar as we all accept that an illogical proposition must be false or invalid.

Those preferences which can be considered binding upon others can be termed “universal preferences,” or “moral rules.”

How else can we know that the concept of “moral rules” is valid?

We can examine the question biologically as well as syllogistically.

For instance, all matter is subject to physical rules – and everything that lives is in addition subject to certain requirements, and thus, if it is alive, must have followed universally preferred behaviours. Życie, na przykład, wymaga paliwa i tlenu. Any living mind, of course, is an organic part of the physical world, and so is subject to physical laws and must have followed universally preferred behaviours – to argue otherwise would require proof that consciousness is not composed of matter, and is not organic – an impossibility, since it has mass, energy, and life. Arguing that consciousness is subject to neither physical rules nor universally preferred behaviours would be like arguing that human beings are immune to gravity, and can flourish without eating.

Thus it is impossible that anyone can logically argue against universally preferable behaviour, since if he is alive to argue, he must have followed universally preferred behaviours such as breathing, eating and drinking.

Syllogistically, this is:

1. All organisms require universally preferred behaviour to live.
2. Man is a living organism.
3. Therefore all living men are alive due to the practice of universally preferred behaviour.
4. Therefore any argument against universally preferable behaviour requires an acceptance and practice of universally preferred behaviour.
5. Therefore no argument against the existence of universally preferable behaviour can be valid.

Since the scientific method requires empirical corroboration, we must also look to reality to confirm our hypothesis – and here the validity of universally preferable behaviour is fully supported.

Every sane human being believes in moral rules of some kind. There is some disagreement about what *constitutes* moral rules, but everyone is certain that moral rules are valid – just as many scientists disagree, but all scientists accept the validity of the scientific method itself. One can argue that the Earth is round and not flat – which is analogous to changing the definition of morality – but one cannot argue that the Earth does not exist at all – which is like arguing that there is no such thing as universally preferable behaviour.

Or:

1. Aby teoria naukowa była ważna, musi być poparta obserwacją empiryczną.
2. Jeśli pojęcie "powszechnie preferowanego zachowania" jest ważne, ludzkość powinna wierzyć w powszechnie preferowane zachowanie.
3. Wszyscy ludzie wierzą w powszechnie preferowane zachowanie.
4. Therefore empirical evidence exists to support the validity of universally preferable behaviour – and the existence of such evidence *opposes* the proposition that universally preferable behaviour is not valid.

The fourth argument for the validity of universally preferable behaviour is also empirical. Since human beings have an almost-infinite number of choices to make in life, to say that there are no principles of universally preferable behaviour would be to say that all choices are equal (i.e. subjective). However, all choices are *not* equal, either logically or through empirical observation.

Na przykład, jeśli jedzenie jest dostępne, prawie wszyscy ludzie wolą jeść codziennie. Gdy jest zimno, prawie wszyscy ludzie szukają ciepła. Prawie wszyscy rodzice wybierają karmienie, schronienie i edukowanie swoich dzieci. Istnieje wiele przykładów powszechnych wyborów wśród ludzkości, które wskazują, że powszechnie preferowane zachowanie obfituje i jest częścią ludzkiej natury.

Jak wspomniano powyżej, żadna ważna teoria fizyki nie może odrzucić prostego faktu, że dzieci mogą łapać muchy - w ten sam sposób żadna prawidłowa teoria etyki nie może odrzucić niekończących się dowodów na akceptację UPB.

Lub:

1. Możliwości są niemal nieskończone.
2. Większość ludzi dokonuje bardzo podobnych wyborów.
3. W związku z tym nie wszystkie opcje mogą być równe.
4. Dlatego też powszechnie preferowane wybory muszą być prawidłowe.

Piąty argument dotyczący ważności powszechnie preferowanego zachowania jest ewolucyjny.

Ponieważ całe życie organiczne wymaga zachowania preferencyjnego, możemy założyć, że te organizmy, które dokonują najbardziej udanych wyborów, są najczęściej wybierane do przeżycia.

Since man is the most successful species, and man’s most distinctive organ is his mind, it must be man’s *mind* that has aided him the most in making successful choices. The mind itself, then, has been selected as successful by its very ability to make successful choices. Since the human mind only exists as a *result* of choosing universally preferable behaviour, universally preferable behaviour must be a valid concept.

Or:

1. Organisms succeed by acting upon universally preferable behaviour.
2. Człowiek jest najbardziej udanym organizmem.
3. Dlatego człowiek musiał działać najskuteczniej na podstawie powszechnie preferowanego zachowania.
4. Umysł człowieka jest jego najbardziej charakterystycznym narządem.
5. Dlatego ludzki umysł musiał działać najlepiej z powodu ogólnie preferowanych zachowań.
6. Dlatego też zachowanie powszechnie preferowane musi być prawidłowe.

We could bring many more arguments to support the existence and validity of UPB, but we shall rest our case with the above, and move to an examination of the nature of UPB.

#### UPB: Optional And Objective

Since we have proven the validity of universally preferable behaviour, the question of morality now shifts. Since morality *is* valid, what theories can quantify, classify, explain and predict it?

Przede wszystkim musimy pamiętać, że moralność jest oczywiście opcjonalna. Każdy człowiek podlega grawitacji i potrzebuje żywności, aby żyć, ale żaden człowiek nie musi postępować moralnie. Jeśli zgwałcę, ukradnę lub zabije, żaden piorun mnie nie uderzy. Reguły moralne, takie jak metoda naukowa czy klasyfikacja biologiczna, są jedynie sposobami racjonalnego organizowania faktów i zasad w stosunku do obiektywnej rzeczywistości.

The fact that compliance with moral rules is *optional*, however, has confused many thinkers into believing that morality itself is *subjective*. Nothing could be further from the truth.

Living organisms are part of material reality, and material reality is rational and objective. Applying moral theories is optional, but that does not mean that all moral theories are subjective. The scientific method is also optional, but it is not subjective. Applying biological classifications is optional, but biology is not subjective. Choices are optional; consequences are not. I can choose not to eat, but I cannot choose to live without eating. I can choose to behead someone, but I cannot choose whether or not they can live without a head. Morality is thus optional, but the *effects* of moral choices are measurable and objective.

Teraz, skoro moralność jest ważną koncepcją, następne pytanie brzmi: w jakim stopniu lub rozmiarze moralność jest ważna?

As mentioned above, the first test of any scientific theory is *universality*. Just as a theory of physics must apply to *all* matter, a moral theory that claims to describe the preferable actions of mankind *must apply to **all** mankind*. No moral theory can be valid if it argues that a certain action is *right* in Syria, but *wrong* in San Francisco. It cannot say that Person A *must* do X, but Person B must *never* do X. It cannot say that what was *wrong* yesterday is *right* today – or vice versa. If it does, it is false and must be refined or discarded.

To be valid, any moral theory must also pass the criterion of *logical consistency*. Since the behaviour of matter is logical, consistent and predictable, all theories involving matter – either organic or inorganic – must also be logical, consistent and predictable. The theory of relativity cannot argue that the speed of light is both constant and not constant at the same time, or that it is one hundred eighty-six thousand kilometres per second, five kilometres in depth, and also green in colour.

However, since moral theories apply to mankind, and mankind is organic, the degree of *empirical* consistency required for moral theories is less than that required for *inorganic* theories. All rocks, for instance, must fall down, but not all horses have to be born with only one head. Biology includes three forms of “randomness,” which are environment, genetic mutation and free will. For example, poodles are generally friendly, but if beaten for years, will likely become aggressive. Horses are defined as having only one head, but occasionally, a two-headed mutant is born. Similarly, human beings generally prefer eating to starving – except anorexics. These exceptions do not bring down the entire science of biology. Thus, since moral theories describe mankind, they cannot be subjected to exactly the same requirements for consistency as theories describing inorganic matter.

The final test that any moral theory must pass is the criterion of empirical observation. For instance, a moral theory must explain the universal prevalence of moral beliefs among mankind, as well as the divergent results of human moral “experiments” such as fascism, communism, socialism or capitalism. It must also explain some basic facts about human society, such as the fact that state power always increases, or that propaganda tends to increase as state power increases. If it fails to explain the past, understand the present and predict the future, then it must be rejected as invalid.

#### UPB: The Practice

How does all this look in practice? Let’s look at how the requirement for *universality* affects moral theories. We shall touch here on proofs and disproofs for specific moral propositions, which we shall examine in more detail in Part Two.

If I say that gravity affects matter, it must affect *all* matter. If even one pebble proves immune to gravity, my theory is in trouble. If I propose a moral theory that argues that people should not murder, it must be applicable to *all* people. If certain people (such as soldiers) are exempt from that rule, then I have to either prove that soldiers are *not* people, or accept that my moral theory is false. There is no other possibility. On the other hand, if I propose a moral theory that argues that all people *should* murder, then I have saved certain soldiers, but condemned to evil all those *not* currently murdering someone (including those being murdered!) – which is surely incorrect.

If, to save the virtue of soldiers, I alter my theory to argue that it is moral for people to murder if someone else tells them to (a political leader, say), then I must deal with the problem of universality. If Politician A can order a soldier to murder an Iraqi, then the Iraqi must also be able to order the soldier to murder Politician A, and the soldier can also order Politician A to murder the Iraqi. The application of this theory results in a general and amoral paralysis, and thus is proven invalid.

I also cannot logically argue that is wrong for *some* people to murder, but right for *other* people to murder. Since all human beings share common physical properties and requirements, proposing one rule for one person and the *opposite* rule for another is invalid – it is like proposing a physics theory that says that some rocks fall down, while others fall up. Not only is it illogical, it contradicts an observable fact of reality, which is that human beings as a species share common characteristics, and so cannot be subjected to opposing rules. Biologists have no problems classifying certain organisms as “human” because they share common and easily identifiable characteristics – it is only moralists who seem to find this level of consistency impossible.

Furthermore, if my moral theory “proves” that the same man should not murder one day, but *should* murder the next day (say, when he steps out into the Iraqi desert), then my position is even more ludicrous. That would be equivalent to arguing that *one day a rock falls downward, and the next day it falls upward!* To call this any kind of consistent theory is to make madness sanity.

Since valid theories require *logical consistency*, a moral theory cannot be valid if it is both true and false at the same time. A moral theory that approves of stealing, for instance, faces an insurmountable logical problem. No moral theory should, if it is universally applied, directly eliminate behaviour it defines as moral while simultaneously creating behaviour it defines as *immoral*. If everyone *should* steal, then no one *will* steal – which means that the moral theory can never be practised. And *why* will no one steal? Well, because a man will only steal if he can *keep* the property he is stealing. He’s not going to bother stealing a wallet if someone else is going to immediately steal that wallet from him. Any moral theory proposing that “stealing is good” is also automatically invalid because it posits that property rights are both valid and invalid *at the same time*, and so fails the test of logical consistency. If I steal from you, I am saying that *your* property rights are invalid. However, I want to *keep* what I am stealing – and therefore I am saying that *my* property rights are valid. However, property rights cannot be both valid and invalid at the same time, and so this proposition itself must be invalid.

Similarly, any moral theory that advocates rape faces a similar contradiction. Rape can *never* be moral, since any principle that approves it automatically contradicts itself. If rape is justified on the principle that “taking pleasure is always good,” then such a principle immediately fails the test of logical consistency, since the rapist may be “taking pleasure,” but his victim certainly is *not*.[^7]

Thus subjecting moral theories to the scientific method produces results that conform to rationality, empirical observations and plain common sense. Murder, theft, arson, rape and assault are all proven immoral.[^8]

To aid in swallowing this rather large conceptual pill, below is a table that helps equate theories of physics and biology with scientific theories of universally preferable (or moral) behaviour:

Table: Theories of physics and biology and of UPB

In conclusion, it is safe to say that (a) moral rules are valid, and (b) moral theories must be subjected to the rigours of logic and evidence, just as theories of physics and biology are. Any moral theory based on non-universal or self-contradictory principles is demonstrably false.

#### UPB: The Framework

UPB can thus be seen as a framework for validating ethical theories or propositions – just as the scientific method is a framework that is used to validate scientific theories or propositions.

An example of a moral proposition is: “the initiation of the use of force is wrong.” UPB is the methodology that tests that proposition against both internal consistency and empirical observation. UPB thus first asks: *is the proposition logical and consistent?* UPB then asks: *what evidence exists for the truth of the proposition?*

To keep this book at a reasonable length, we will in general deal mostly with the first criterion of logical consistency. For the second criterion, we shall rely for evidence on the universal prohibitions across all cultures against certain actions such as rape, theft, assault and murder. Much more could be written on the historical evidence that helps support or reject various moral propositions, but we shall leave that for another time. If we establish the validity of UPB, we have achieved an enormous amount. If we do not, evidence will scarcely help us.

Let us now turn to the question of whether the UPB framework deals with matters of *ethics*, or *aesthetics*, or both.

[^7]: The same goes, of course, for murder and assault. We will be returning to these proofs – as well as a further examination of property rights – in more detail in Part Two of this book.

[^8]: Universal and positive moral rules can also be proven – i.e. the universal validity of property rights and non-violence – but we shall discuss that in Part Two.
