## Ekonomia i Socjologia Opodatkowania

Jak wskazuje tytuł rozdziału, postawiłem sobie dwa cele. Po pierwsze chcę wyjaśnić ogólne skutki ekonomiczne opodatkowania. This part of the chapter represents a praxeological analysis of taxation and as such should not be expected to go much beyond what has already been said by other economists.

More originality might be found in the second part, where I will try to answer the question: why is there taxation; and why is there always more of it? Answering such questions is not the task of economic theory but of praxeologically informed and constrained sociological or historical interpretations and reconstructions, and from the very outset much more room for speculation in this field of intellectual inquiry exists.

To say there is nothing new to be stated regarding the economic effects of taxation is not to say that what there *is* would not be news to many. Po przeczytaniu kilku popularnych książek ekonomicznych wydaje się, że to, co mam do powiedzenia, jest aktualnością dla większości dzisiejszych ekonomistów i studentów ekonomii. Insofar as these texts deal with the economic effects of taxation at all, beyond a purely descriptive presentation of various tax-schemes and their historical development[^1], they are almost completely silent on the question of what the general effects of taxation are. Moreover, what in their discussion of the problem of tax-incidence these texts then say about the economic effects of specific forms of taxation is invariably flawed.

However, this state of affairs merely reflects a process of intellectual degeneration. As early as 150 years ago almost everything that should be understood today about the economics of taxation had been correctly and convincingly stated by such a prominent figure in the history of economics as Jean Baptiste Say in his *Treatise on Political Economy*.

In contrast to today’s textbook writers, who assign the discussion of taxation to arbitrary places within the overall architectonic of their books, from the beginning Say correctly locates the phenomenon under the general heading “Of the Consumption of Wealth.”

He then unmistakenly identifies and explains taxation as an attack on and punishment of the acquisition and production of property, which necessarily leads to a reduction in the formation of wealth embodied in such property and to a lowering of the general standard of living.

Notes Say:

> It is a glaring absurdity to pretend, that taxation contributes to national wealth, by engrossing part of the national produce, and enriches the nation by consuming part of its wealth.[^2]
> 
> Taxation is the transfer of a portion of the national products from the hands of individuals to those of the government, for the purpose of meeting public consumption or expenditure. Bez względu na to, jakie jest denominowanie, niezależnie od tego, czy chodzi o podatki, składki, cła, akcyzy, zwyczaje, pomoc, dotacje, dotacje czy darowizny, jest to praktycznie ciężar nałożony na jednostki, w osobnym lub korporacyjnym charakterze, przez władzę rządzącą w chwili obecnej, w celu dostarczenia konsumpcji, może się wydawać, że należy dokonać tego na własny koszt; krótko mówiąc, impost, w sensie dosłownym.[^3]

Since such fundamental insights seem to have been forgotten, or at least no longer appear obvious today, let me, as my first task, present anew a praxeological account and explanation for Say’s central argument and its validity, and in so doing refute some popular “counterarguments” claiming to show that taxation need not obstruct the formation of property and wealth. In light of this general explanation, I will then demonstrate the fundamental logical fallacy in the standard textbook analysis of tax-incidence.

Opodatkowanie — głównie i przede wszystkim —jest i musi być rozumiane, jako środek do niszczenia własności i formacji dobrobytu, która wynika z prostej logicznej analizy rozumienia opodatkowania.

Taxation is a coercive, non-contractual transfer of definite physical assets (nowadays mostly, but not exclusively money), and the value embodied in them, from a person or group of persons who first held these assets and who could have derived an income from further holding them, to another, who now possesses them and now derives an income from so doing. How did these assets come into the hands of their original owners? Ruling out that this was the outcome of another previous act of taxation, and noting that only those assets can be taxed that have not yet been consumed or whose value has not yet been exhausted through acts of consumption (a tax-gatherer does not take away another man’s garbage but rather his still valuable assets!), three and only three possibilities exist: They come into one’s possession either by one’s having perceived certain nature-given goods as scarce and having actively brought them into one’s possession before anyone else had seen and done so; by having produced them by means of one’s labor out of such previously appropriated goods; or through voluntary, contractual acquisition from a previous appropriator or producer. Only through these types of activities is one capable of acquiring and increasing valuable—and hence taxable—assets. Acts of original appropriation turn something which no one had previously perceived as a possible source of income into an income-providing asset; acts of production are by their very nature aimed at the transformation of a less valuable asset into a more valuable one; and every contractual exchange concerns the change and redirection of specific assets from the hands of those who value their possession less to those who value them more.

Z powyższego wynika, że każda forma opodatkowania oznacza zmniejszenie dochodu, jakiego osoba może oczekiwać z pierwotnego przeznaczenia, z produkcji lub z kontraktu. Since these activities require the employment of scarce means—at least time and the use of one’s body—which could be used for consumption and/or leisure, the opportunity cost of performing them is raised. The marginal utility of appropriating, producing, and contracting is decreased, and the marginal utility of consumption and leisure increased. Accordingly, there will be a tendency to shift out of the former roles and into the latter ones.[^4]

W ten sposób, poprzez przymusowe przenoszenie cennych, jeszcze nie zużytych aktywów od swoich producentów (w szerszym znaczeniu tego słowa, w tym osoby uprawnione i wykonawcy) osobom, które ich nie produkowały, opodatkowanie zmniejsza obecne dochody producentów i ich obecny możliwy poziom konsumpcji. Moreover, it reduces the present incentive for future production of valuable assets and thereby also lowers future income and the future level of available consumption. Taxation is not just a punishment of consumption without any effect on productive efforts; it is also an assault on production as the only means of providing for and possibly increasing future income and consumption expenditure. By lowering the present value associated with future-directed, value-productive efforts, taxation raises the effective rate of time preference, i.e., the rate of originary interest and, accordingly, leads to a shortening of the period of production and provision and so exerts an inexorable influence of pushing mankind into the direction of an existence of living from hand to mouth. Just increase taxation enough, and you will have mankind reduced to the level of barbaric animal beasts.

Straightforward as such reasoning may seem, there are a number of popular objections raised against it. Na przykład ze strony ekonomistów, którzy błędnie pojmują ekonomię jako naukę empiryczną, która produkuje jedynie pozorne wyjaśnienia, które zawsze muszą być przetestowane na podstawie dowodów empirycznych, aby można je było zweryfikować (analogiczna do sytuacji w naukach przyrodniczych), często słyszalny jest następujący argument: Empirycznie zaobserwowano, że wzrostowi poziomu opodatkowania towarzyszył faktycznie wzrost (nie upadek) PNB lub innych mierników wydajności produkcji; stąd powyższe rozumowanie, jakkolwiek wiarygodne, musi być uznane za empirycznie nieważne. In fact, some empiricists of this sort go even further and make the stronger claim that taxation actually helps increase the standard of living as evidenced by the fact that some countries with once low standards of living and low levels of taxation now enjoy a much greater wealth with much higher taxes.

Both objections are simply confused. Experience cannot beat logic, and interpretations of observational evidence which are not in line with the laws of logical reasoning are no refutation of these but the sign of a muddled mind (or would one accept someone’s observational report that he had seen a bird that was red and non-red all over at the same time as a refutation of the law of contradiction rather than the pronouncement of an idiot?).

As regards the stronger thesis, it is nothing but a beautiful illustration of the ever so attractive *post hoc ergo propter hoc* fallacy. From the fact that the correlated events of high taxation and wealth were to be observed later than those of low taxation and wealth it is inferred that increased taxation increases wealth. Yet to reason in this way is about as convincing as the argument—justly ridiculed by Say—that one can observe rich men consuming more than poor ones; therefore, their high level of consumption must be responsible for the fact that they are rich.[^5] Just as it follows from the meaning of consumption that this is impossible and that, on the contrary, the rich are not rich because of their high level of consumption but because they previously abstained from consumption and engaged instead in value-productive actions, so it follows from the meaning of taxation that mankind cannot have prospered because of higher levels of taxation but despite such a fact.

The weaker thesis—that experience would at least disprove any claim of a relationship between taxation and productive output that was negative by necessity—is also off the mark. The praxeological reasoning presented above does not at all rule out what empiricist economists falsely interpret as a refutation. In this earlier discussion the conclusion had been reached that the effect of taxation is a relative reduction in the production of valuable assets—a reduction, that is, as compared with the level of output that would have been produced had there been no taxation at all or had the level of taxation not been raised. Nothing was said or implied with respect to the absolute level of the output of valuable assets. As a matter of fact, absolute growth of GNP, for instance, is not only compatible with our earlier praxeological analysis, but can even be seen as a perfectly normal phenomenon to the extent that advances in productivity are possible and actually take place. If it has become possible through improvements in the technology of production to produce a higher output with an identical input (in terms of cost), or a physically identical output with a reduced input, then the coincidence of increased taxation and an increased output of valuable assets is anything but surprising. However, this does not in the least affect the validity of what has been stated about relative impoverishment resulting from taxation. With a given state of technological knowledge, though it may change over time, and taxation being what it is (a punishment of value-productive efforts), the level of productive output must be lower than the one that could have been attained with the same knowledge and no or lower taxation. Statistical studies here are entirely beside the point: they can neither help strengthen it, nor can they ever be used to weaken it.

Another theoretical objection which enjoys some popularity is that imposing or raising taxes leads to a reduction of income derived from the assets taxed; that this reduction raises the marginal utility of such assets as compared to what can be derived from other forms of activity; and thus, instead of lowering it, taxation actually helps increase the tendency to engage in production. For the usual case of taxing money assets this is to say that taxes reduce monetary income which raises the marginal utility of money, and this in turn increases the incentive to attain monetary returns. This argument, to be sure, is perfectly true as far as it goes. However, it is a misconception to believe that it does anything to invalidate the relative impoverishment thesis that I have advanced. First of all, in order to keep the record straight it should be noted that even if it were true—as the just presented argument seems to suggest, albeit falsely as we will see—that increased taxation does not lead to a relatively lower output of valuable assets produced since it spurs a proportional increase in workaholism, it is still the case that the income of value-productive individuals has fallen. Even if they produce the same output as previously, they can only do so if they expend more labor now than before. Since any additional labor expenditure implies forgone leisure or consumption (leisure or consumption which they otherwise could have enjoyed along with the same output of valuable assets), their overall standard of living must be lower.[^6]

It now becomes apparent why the assumption that taxation can leave the productive output of valuable assets unaffected and exclusively cripple consumption is fatally flawed. Jeżeli opodatkowanie zmniejsza dochód (który obejmuje również pochodną obecnej konsumpcji i wypoczynku), i biorąc pod uwagę powszechny fakt preferencji czasowej, który jest, że ludzcy aktorzy niezmiennie preferują obecne dobra nad przyszłymi dobrami (że nie mogą obejść się bez ciągłej konsumpcji i mogą zaangażować się w dłuższe, bardziej okrężne metody produkcji tylko wtedy, gdy zapewniony zostanie przepis w postaci dóbr konsumpcyjnych na odpowiedni okres oczekiwania), to musi wynikać z tego, że w tym akcie musi zostać podniesiona efektywna stawka preferencji czasowej (nieumiejętność czekania musiała wzrosnąć), i że będzie musiał skrócić długość struktury produkcji w porównaniu do tej, którą inaczej by wybrał. Accordingly, his output of valuable assets available at future dates will have to be lower than would be the case otherwise. If with lower or no taxation his income had been higher and his time preference schedule being given (whatever it happens to be at any particular point in time), he would have invested in lengthier production processes. As a consequence, his output of valuable future assets would have been relatively greater.[^7]

The error in the thesis that taxation can have a neutral effect on production lies in the fact that time preference is not taken into account. The argument presently under scrutiny is quite correct in pointing out that taxation implies a twofold signal: on the one hand the substitution effect working in favor of consumption and leisure and against work; and on the other hand the income effect of raising the marginal utility of the taxed asset. Jednakże błędem jest interpretowanie tego w sposób uproszczony jako mieszany worek sprzecznych sygnałów—jeden na korzyść i jeden przeciwko pracy—aby więc nie można było powiedzieć nic o charakterze kategorycznym w odniesieniu do skutków opodatkowania na produkcję, a kwestia, czy opodatkowanie przewiduje niższą, czy też wyższą produkcję cennych aktywów, należy rozumieć jako całkowicie empiryczną.[^8] Faktycznie bowiem sygnał podatkowy wcale nie jest sprzeczny, gdy uznano, że jest on wysyłany do osób, których działania są niezmiennie ograniczone przez preferencje czasowe. Dla takich aktorów istnieje nie tylko alternatywa między pracą a brakiem pracy, ale także między tworzeniem cennego zasobu na mniej lub bardziej czasochłonne sposoby. Niezmiennie muszą także wybierać pomiędzy szybkim i bezpośrednim pozyskiwaniem aktywów, przy niewielkim czasie oczekiwania, ale za cenę konieczności stosowania mniej wydajnych metod produkcji (słynny rybak, który decyduje się użyć gołych rąk, aby złapać rybę, aby uzyskać ją szybciej, niż poprzez zastosowanie bardziej okrężnych metod produkcji), lub uzyskując go dzięki bardziej produktywnym metodom, ale potem musi czekać dłużej, aby przyniosły korzyści (rybak, który, zwabiony wyższymi przyszłymi powrotami, postanawia znieść dłuższy okres oczekiwania i najpierw buduje sieć). Jednak biorąc pod uwagę te wybory, przesłanie o opodatkowaniu jest całkowicie niedwuznaczne i jednoznaczne, i nie może już być mowy o tym, że efekt substytucji musi być uważany za systematyczny i dominujący dla każdego efektu dochodu: Jeśli istnieje nie tylko opcja posiadania czegoś lub nie posiadania tego, ale także posiadania mniejszej ilości czegoś wcześniej czy później, podwójna wiadomość przesłana przez podatki jest łatwa do zintegrowania i przetłumaczona na jeden: skrócić czas oczekiwania; skrócić rondo metod produkcji! By doing so, valuable assets will be obtained earlier—in line with their increased marginal utility. Simultaneously, in shortening the waiting period, more room will be given for leisure—in line with its increased marginal utility. By reducing the length of roundabout methods of production the two seemingly contradictory signals stemming from taxation are simultaneously accounted for. Contrary to any claim of a systematically “neutral” effect of taxation on production, the consequence of any such shortening of roundabout methods of production is a lower output produced. The price that invariably must be paid for taxation, and for every increase in taxation, is a coercively lowered productivity that in turn reduces the standard of living in terms of valuable assets provided for future consumption. Every act of taxation necessarily exerts a push away from more highly capitalized, more productive production processes in the direction of a hand-to-mouth-existence.

[^7]: One might object here that the tax receipts will come into someone’s hands—those of government officials or of governmental transfer-paymentrecipients—and that their increased income, resulting in a lower effective time preference rate for them, may offset the increase in this rate on the taxpayers’ side and hence leave the overall rate and the structure of production unchanged. Such reasoning, however, is categorically flawed: For one thing, insofar as government expenditure is concerned, it cannot be regarded as investment at all. Rather, it is consumption, and consumption alone. For, as Rothbard has explained,

> [i]n any sort of division-of-labor economy, capital goods are built, not for their own sake by the investor, but in order to use them to produce lower-order and eventually consumers’ goods. In short, a characteristic of an investment expenditure is that the good in question is not being used to fulfill the needs of the investor, but of someone else—the consumer. Yet, when government confiscates resources from the private market economy, it is precisely defying the wishes of the consumers; when government invests in any good, it does so to serve the whims of government officials, not the desires of consumers. (*Man, Economy, and State*, pp. 816–17)

Thus, government expenditure, by definition, cannot be conceived of as lengthening the production structure and hence as counterbalancing the taxpayers’ raised time preference rate.—On the other hand,

> as for the *transfer* expenditures made by the government (including the salaries of bureaucrats and subsidies to privileged groups), it is true that some of this will be saved and invested. These investments, however, will not represent the voluntary desires of consumers, but rather investments in fields of production *not* desired by the *producing* consumers…. Once let the tax be eliminated, and … the new investments called forth by the demands of the specially privileged will turn out to be *malinvestments*. (*Power and Market*, p. 98)

Consequently, transfer expenditures also cannot be conceived of as compensating for the fact that taxpayers shorten the length of the production structure. All such expenditures can do is to lengthen the structure of mal-production. “At any rate” concludes Rothbard,

> the amount consumed by the government insures that the effect of income taxation will be to raise time-preference ratios and to reduce saving and investment. (Ibid., p. 98)
