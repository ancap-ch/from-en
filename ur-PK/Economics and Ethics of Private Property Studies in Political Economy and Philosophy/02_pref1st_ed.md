## پہلے ایڈیشن کی تمہید

مشرقی یورپ بھر میں سوشلزم کا زوال — جن کو ہمیشہ یاد رہنے والے واقعات ڈرامائی طور پر ثبوت کے طور پر تاریخ 9نومبر 1989، جب مشرقی اور مغربی جرمن ایک جھٹ ہوئے جو آگے بڈھے اوربرلن دیوار کی انتہا پر اپنی کافی زیادہ خوشی کا اظہار کیا، اسکی وجہ سے مرکزی زیر بحث قضیہ میں مزید حمایت اورفوری طور پر اس اس دیباچہ میں ہوئی جس کی میں نے کبھی امید بھی نہیں کی تھی.

Whether the following studies deal with economic topics such as employment, interest, money, banking, business cycles, taxes, public goods, or growth; with philosophical problems as the foundations of knowledge, and of economics and ethics in particular; or the reconstruction and theoretical explanation of historical and sociological phenomena such as exploitation, the rise and fall of civilizations, international politics, war, imperialism, and the role of ideas and ideological movements in the course of social evolution—each ultimately contributes to but one conclusion: The right to private property is an indisputably valid, absolute principle of ethics and the basis for continuous “optimal” economic progress. To rise from the ruins of socialism and overcome the stagnation of the Western welfare states, nothing will suffice but the uncompromising privatization of all socialized, that is, government, property and the establishment of a contractual society based on the recognition of the absoluteness of private property rights.

In writing the following studies I received help from many sides. Special thanks go to my wife Margaret, who again took on the task of de-Germanizing my English; to Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and to Burton S. Blumert, president of the Center for Libertarian Studies, for their continuing support of my work; and to my friend David Gordon, for his numerous invaluable suggestions and comments.

My largest debt is to Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard, the twentieth century’s two greatest-though much neglected-economists and social philosophers. While I never met Ludwig von Mises, and indeed had not heard of his name until after his death, I am fortunate to have been closely associated with Murray Rothbard for the past six years, first in New York City, and since 1986 as colleagues at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Apart from the intellectual debt that I owe him, words cannot express my personal gratitude. His wisdom, insight, kindness, enthusiasm, and unflagging encouragement have been a continuous inspiration to me. It is, therefore, to him that this volume is dedicated.
