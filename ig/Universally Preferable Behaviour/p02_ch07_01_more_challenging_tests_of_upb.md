## More Challenging Tests Of UPB

We have now tested specific moral theories relative to the framework of UPB, and found that UPB validates our most commonly held moral beliefs, such as prohibitions against rape, murder and theft. By bringing the criterion of *avoidability* into our analysis, we have also helped differentiate between crimes that cannot be avoided, and crimes that must be enabled through positive action, such as fraud. Finally, we have divided “preferable behaviour” into three major categories – universal, aesthetic, and neutral (and their relevant opposites). Universally prohibited actions include rape, murder and theft, which force may be used to prevent. Aesthetically preferable actions include politeness, being on time and so on, which cannot be enforced through violence. Neutral actions include purely subjective preferences, or actions that have no moral content, such as running for a bus.

However, there remain many challenging moral tests that fall outside the examples we have dealt with above. We will only deal with a few of those here, to have a look at the framework of UPB, and see how it deals with these more challenging moral questions.

### Self-Defence

The concept of self-defence should not be taken for granted. If we assume that there is no such thing as self-defence, or that self-defence is never a valid action, then the framework of UPB undoes that assumption very quickly.

If there is no such thing as self-defence, then we are not talking about the initiation or the retaliation of the use of force, but rather just the use of force in any context. In other words, if we get rid of the concept of self-defence, the only question that we need to ask ourselves is: *is it universally preferable to use force, or not?*

If it were universally preferable to use force, then no human being should ever advance a moral argument, but should rather use force to achieve his ends. However, just as in the rape, theft and murder examples cited above, the claim that it is universally preferable to use force immediately invalidates itself. To be able to use force upon another person requires that that person submit to force – in other words, in order for one person to be moral, the other person must be immoral, which cannot stand. Also, if the other person *submits* to force, it is not force – thus he must *resist*, which requires that he resist virtue in order to enable virtue, which is self-contradictory.

In addition, if it is always preferable to use force, then crimes such as rape and murder become irrelevant, because if it is always preferable to use force, then love-making becomes immoral, and rape becomes moral – but only for the rapist, while *submission* to violence, rather than violence itself, becomes moral for his victim, which is a contradiction.

If, on the other hand, we say that violence is bad, then we open up the possibility of self-defence If it is a UPB-compliant statement to say that violence is evil, then we know that, since that which is evil can be prevented through the use of violence, the use of violence to *oppose* violence is morally valid.

Thus, since we know that violence is evil, we know that we may use force to oppose it. If we define an action as evil, but also prevent anybody from acting against it, then we are no longer moral philosophers, but merely judgemental archaeologists. This would be akin to a medical theory that said that illness is bad, but that it is evil to attempt to prevent or cure it – which would make no sense whatsoever.

Also, if human beings cannot validly act to prevent harm to themselves, then actions such as inoculations, wearing gloves in the cold, putting on sunscreen or insect repellent, building a wall to prevent a landslide, brushing one’s teeth, wearing shoes and so on are all immoral actions. If we return to Bob and Doug, and we give them the moral argument that self-defence is always wrong, what results?

Well, we create another paradox. Self-defence is the use of violence to prevent violence. If self-defence is always wrong, then it cannot be violently “inflicted” upon an attacker. However, preferences that cannot be inflicted upon others fall into the APA or morally neutral category. To place the violence of self-defence into these categories is to say that violence cannot be inflicted on others – but the very nature of violence is that it *is* inflicted on others, and thus this approach results in a surfeit of contradictions.

Self-defence cannot be “evil”, since evil by definition can be prevented through force. However, self-defence is a response to the initiation of force, and thus cannot be prevented through force, any more than you can stop the motion of a soccer ball by kicking it violently.

Self-defence also cannot be *required* behaviour, since required behaviour (“don’t rape”) can be enforced through violence, which would mean that anyone failing to violently defend himself could be legitimately aggressed against. However, someone failing to defend himself is *already* being aggressed against, and so we end up in a circular situation where everyone can legitimately act violently against a person who is not defending himself, which is not only illogical, but morally abhorrent.

If Bob attacks Doug, but it is completely wrong for Doug to use violence to defend himself, then violence ends up being placed into two moral categories – the initiation of force is morally good, but self-defence is morally evil, which cannot stand according to UPB.

However, you might argue, does not the proposition that self-defence is good also make violence both good and bad at the same time – the violence that is used to attack is bad, but the violence that is used for self-defence is good?

This is an interesting objection – however, if the initiation of force is evil, then it can be prohibited by using force, since that is one of the very definitions of evil that we worked out above.

Thus it is impossible for any logical moral theory to reject the moral validity of self-defence.

### Raising pikin

By instincts, all of us understand say sometin dey wrong with mama and papa dem wey nor dey give small pikin food. For mama to get belle, carry de belle till nine months, come born de pikin, and den leave de pikin to die of hunger, no make sense at all.

Na true sey our offence nor be wetin dem go argue weda e gud or bad, but na just wetin dem we nid to test moral theory.

Before wen we bin dey tok about UPB, we notice say de place wey exceptions dey for UPB, objective difference go dey for living things. Or to put am well, de places wey objective difference dey for living things, rational exceptions or difference go fit dey for UPB. Pikin wey dey five year na immature brain and nervous system wey im get. So im nor go fit know de wahala wey de things wey im do now go cause later. Na de premature brain be de main thing here. Na so if man wey don kolo and im brain come be like  five years own, we nor go too blame am for de things im do. 

Na so wen we touch mata of reduced responsibility, we nor dey remove responsibility wey dey already, but instead we dey try to create mata wey be say responsibility no exist somehow. If I say de man wey dey wheel chair nor go fit take de escalator, I nor dey corner side im right to take de escalator, but I just dey point out sey im nor got fit use am. Wen I say UPB to apply to de things wey pikin of  five years do.  I no dey yarn sey  UPB dey subjective pass wetin person go reach before im fit enta roller costa make de idea of "tall" subjective.

If I enta contract with you by my sef wey I promise say I go pay your bills for one year, I neva turn my sef to slave, but I don decide to do sometin and now I dey responsible for am.

If I dey run small hospital, and I collect sick people wey no fit chop by dem sef, den if I nor feed dem by my sef, I go dey responsible if dem die of hunger.  Nobody dey force me to collect dem sick people, but once I don  declare say I go  take care of dem, den  na me dey responsible for dia well being.

Na de same way if  I borrow your lawnmower, i suppose bring am back as e bin dey wen I borrow am. And na so, if I go buy dog for pet shop, I suppose take care of de dog. Dis one nor mean say I don become de dog slave until de day e die, but e mean say since de dog dey my hand, na my responsibility to keep am healthy.

Dis kind of contracts dem dey common for life, we no dey sign contract with restaurant owner wen we go eat for dia. Na normal thing say we go pay before we comot. I neva sign contract wen I enta store before to promise say I nor go thief sometin for inside de shop, but dem get right to arrest me if I later thief dia thing. I neva sign contract before say I nor go rape any woman if we go date, yet UPB dey yarn say dat kind contract dey exist.

If I run small hospital, and disable people dey hope on me to feed dem, If I come show say I nor go fit feed dem cos of one thing, den I suppose find anoda person wey go feed dem. De big danger nor be say I nor give dem food, but na say people think say I dey give dem food so dem no boda to bring food.  Dis one follow for one old argument about wetin gud and bad wey person jump enter river to go save anoda person. I nor dey obligated to enta de river go save de person, but the moment wey I enta the river – or talk say I wan go save de person – den I dey responsible to wan save de person, for de reason wey oda people think say I wan go save de person and so dem no go boda to save de person.

Na so we assume say mama and papa dem go take care of dia new born baby come give am food. So if de parent dem now come decide say dem nor go fit care of de pikin, den dem obligated to carry de pikin give who go take care of am, or face charges say na dem kill de pikin. Na so wey de person we dey in charge of disable home, suppose feed dose wey dey hope on am to fit chop or carry dem give who go do am. If I decide say I nor wan care for my dog again, I suppose find am anoda owner instead of to let am die of hunger

All dis one rely on top de principle of third-party sef-defence, wey UPB framework support wella, since the right of sef-defense na as everybody think am. If I see woman wey dey attack man for wheelchair, I get right to defend de man – and dis one only dey true if de man nor fit defend im sef.

Since small pikin dem nro fit feed dem sef, work, get money or live by dem sef,  dem just be like people wey dem kidnap, or de wife wey we yarn before wey her husband lock inside basement. Children too nor fit defend dia sef, cos of dia small stature and dem dey always depend on dia mama and papa.

So, since e don be de case say we get right to defend anoda person – and dat right come strong if dat person nor fit defend im sef, e dey valid to use force on top parents wey nor dey feed dia pikin, just as e valid to use force on top husband wey want im wife to die of hunger as im lock her for basement.

As we don yarn before just as de victim nor fit defend im sef na so de crime big reach. Even de wife wey see her sef inside basement follow for de mata cos na she choose to marry de evil man fess fess. Once she don enta de basement, she nor go fit avoid de situation, yet she bin don dey see signs say her husband dey abusive, from day one.

Na children be de worse, cos dem neva get chance to avoid de situation wey dem dey inside, So we fit use UPB framework show parents wetin dem owe dia children. Since everybody dey responsible for wetin dia body do, and na from dia body wey dis pikin dem come out, dat one mean say parents dey responsible for dia pikin. Since every body get right to defend dia sef and oda people. Since na everybody get dis right. Any body go fit do sometin to defend children. Since every person suppose complete dia own obligation, and to get children na one of dose obligation. Papa and mama dem must complete dia obligation wey concern dia pikin. Since you show less concern and person wey depend on you die e dey equal to say na you kill am, parents dey liable for dat kind crime.

We fit push de proposition go front say parents nor nid to care for dia children, but dat one nor follow for wetin good at all. – e go mean de same thing as to say parents fit kill wey nor be UPB-complaint, and so e go nid biological differentiation to support am – and to be papa or mama nor fit make anybody stop to be human being.

Parents dem wey leave dia pikin to die of hunger dey guilty of murder. Pikin dem dey enta dis world and de family wey dem enta be like prison for dem – dis one no mean say de family evil or corrupt – na just biological fact. Pikin dey tied to dia parent cos na dia parents choose – dis tori come put parents wey dey show less concern for same position as kidnappers wey dey let who dem catch die of hunger, or nurse wey leave sick person wey dey hope on am to die of thirst.
