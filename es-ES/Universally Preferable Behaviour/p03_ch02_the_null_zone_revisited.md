## La zona nula revisitada

Al comienzo de este libro, propongo una forma de ver cómo procesamos la verdad, analogándola con la física. De las "pequeñas verdades" de atrapar una pelota de béisbol, llegamos a las "grandes verdades" de la física, y las grandes verdades no pueden contradecir las pequeñas verdades.

Lo mismo es cierto de la moralidad. A partir de las pequeñas verdades de "No debería asesinar", podemos llegar a las grandes verdades, como "el inicio del uso de la fuerza es moralmente incorrecto"

En el ámbito de la física, una barrera central para la extrapolación lógica de las verdades desde la experiencia personal hasta la teoría universal ha sido la religión.

Por ejemplo, ningún hombre ha experimentado directamente un círculo perfecto; tal entidad existe en lo abstracto y en las matemáticas, pero ninguna puede visualizarse en la mente ni experimentar sensualmente en el mundo real. En ninguna parte de la naturaleza, que sepamos, existe un círculo perfecto, ya sea en las "pequeñas verdades" de la experiencia personal o en las "grandes verdades" de la física.

Sin embargo, durante miles de años, la ciencia de la astronomía quedó paralizada por la búsqueda de este "círculo perfecto". Las órbitas planetarias tenían que ser círculos perfectos, porque Dios nunca permitiría algo tan "imperfecto" como una elipse en Su creación.

El problema con este enfoque - bueno, un problema de todos modos - fue el movimiento retrógrado de Marte. Desde nuestro planeta, Marte a veces parece moverse "hacia atrás", mientras la Tierra "lo adelanta" alrededor del sol. La falsa creencia de que la Tierra era el centro del sistema solar, combinada con una manía de círculos "perfectos", produjo el sistema ptolemaico de astronomía, que multiplicó todos estos círculos perfectos hasta el absurdo, para tener en cuenta órbitas elípticas y el movimiento retrógrado de Marte.

Why was this illusion of perfection considered to be a requirement for celestial bodies? Certainly the evidence of the moon, with its pitted and cratered surface, would seem to support the imperfection of the heavens, but religious fixations bypassed the direct sensual evidence of both immediate and interplanetary imperfections. Galileo’s discoveries of moon-mountains, sunspots and Jupiter’s moons were all attacked as heretical.

We can also turn this analysis to the question of the existence of God as well.

We have no direct, empirical or rational evidence for the existence of God. The most abstract scientific measurements provide no evidence for the existence of God either – yet in between the truth of our own experience, which is that there is no God, and the most abstract scientific measurements and theories – which also confirm that there is no God – a sort of “null zone” is willed into existence, *which completely inverts any rational standards of truth*.

### Bigotry

Beliefs may be true, false, or *anti-truth*. It is a true belief that the Sahara Desert is in North Africa; it is a false belief that the Sahara is in Scotland; it is an *anti-true* belief that the Sahara is whatever I want it to be, and exists wherever I want it to exist. The first belief is true; the second is false – the third is a bigoted assertion that detonates the very concept of proof.

We can say:

1. Proposition X is true because it is rational.
2. Proposition Y is false because it is irrational.
3. Proposition Z is true because I *want* it to be true.

The third assertion is a complete self-contradiction. “Truth” is independent of desire, since desire is by definition a subjective preference, and truth is by definition the conformity of ideas to the objective standards of logic and empirical reality. Saying that something is true because you *want* it to be true is to equate subjectivity with objectivity, which is a self-contradictory statement.

Bigoted assertions – or “faith” – by definition cannot be tested, since they are not belief in the *absence* of evidence, but belief in *defiance* of reason and/or evidence.

We can believe unproven things that turn out to be true – someone doubtless thought that the world was round before it was proven – but the “null zone” is the realm wherein we cling to a belief in things that *could not possibly turn out to be true*.

If I say that two plus two equals five, I am making a mistake that can be corrected with reference to logic. If I say that I believe that a square circle exists, then I am making an explicitly self-contradictory statement, which disproves itself. If I go further, however, and emphatically claim that “foo plus tury equals desty” – and refuse to define any of my terms – I am making a statement to which logic and evidence *cannot be applied*.

### Next Stop: The "Alternative Universe"

In general, the way that people try to “save” their anti-empirical and anti-logical beliefs is to create an “alternate realm” or “alternate universe” wherein their self-contradictory statements can somehow be true.

If I say: “A square circle exists,” I am asserting that which is clearly impossible within this universe. Thus, if I wish to retain my belief, I must invent some other universe, or realm “outside” this universe where a square circle can exist.

If I make up a realm where self-contradiction equals truth, I can then claim that those who say that a square circle does *not* exist are themselves bigoted and prejudicial, because they are eliminating possibilities that *could* be true.[^1]

With regards to this “null zone,” only two possibilities really exist. Either this *null zone* exists completely independently of our universe, and will never be measurable, detectable or discoverable in any way, shape or form – or, at some point, we shall be able to detect and interact with this magical land where self-contradiction equals truth.

If, at some point, it turns out that we *are* able to interact with this *null zone*, then we shall have direct sensual or rational evidence of its existence. In other words, it must “protrude” into our universe in some manner. However, the moment that it becomes detectable in our universe, it must have rational and empirical existence, like everything else we can detect. Thus these otherworldly “protrusions” into our universe *cannot create the capacity for our universe to support the existence of a square circle*.

We can thus be certain that if we *are* ever able to detect this other universe, the evidence we gather will in no way support the existence of self-contradictory statements. Square circles, gods and other self-contradictory concepts cannot hide there, any more than they can hide in the wet dreams of leprechauns.

On the other hand, if it turns out that we are *never* able to detect this other universe, and it remains a completely theoretical entity, with no evidence or rationality to support it, then it is simply a conceptual bag in which it is “convenient” to place things that are obviously not true.

[^1]: This inevitably ends up with comparisons to those who said that Einsteinian physics was impossible, that the world could not be round and so on. Uncertainty in *content* – i.e. theory – is somehow supposed to be equated with uncertainty in *methodology*, i.e. reason and evidence. The fact that a mathematical theorem can be disproved does not disprove the principles of mathematics, but rather confirms them.
