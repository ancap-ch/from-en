## Más Retos Desafiantes para CUP

Ahora hemos puesto a prueba teorías morales específicas relativas al marco del CUP, y hemos encontrado que CUP valida la mayoría de nuestras creencias morales comunes, como la prohibición contra la violación, el asesinato y el robo. Trayendo el criterio de *evitación* a nuestro análisis, también hemos ayudado a diferenciar entre crímenes que no pueden ser evitados, y crímenes que deben ser habilitados a través de acciones positivas, como el fraude. Finalmente, hemos dividido el "comportamiento preferible" entre tres grandes categorías – universal, estética, y neutro (y sus opuestos relevantes). Acciones universalmente prohibidas incluyen la violación, el asesinato y el robo, donde la fuerza puede ser utilizada para prevenir. Acciones estéticamente preferibles incluyen la amabilidad, estar a tiempo y así sucesivamente, que no pueden ser forzadas a través de la violencia. Acciones neutras incluyen preferencias puramente subjetivas, o acciones que no tienen contenido moral, como correr hacia un autobús.

Sin embargo, permanecen muchos retos morales desafiantes que son externos a los ejemplos discutidos anteriormente. Sólo discutiremos aquí unos cuantos de ellos, para tener un vistazo al marco del CUP, y ver como éste se encarga de estas cuestiones morales desafiantes.

### Autodefensa

No se debe menospreciar el concepto de la autodefensa. Si asumimos que no existe cosa tal como la autodefensa, o que la autodefensa nunca es una acción válida, entonces el marco del CUP deshecha la suposición de manera rápida.

Si la autodefensa no existe, entonces no estamos hablando sobre la iniciación o las represalias del uso de la fuerza, sino sobre el uso de la fuerza en cualquier contexto. En otras palabras, si nos deshacemos del concepto de la autodefensa, la única cuestión que necesitamos preguntarnos es: *¿es universalmente preferible utilizar la fuerza, o no?*

Si fuese universalmente preferible utilizar la fuerza, entonces ningún ser humano debería avanzar un argumento moral, pero en su lugar debería utilizar la fuerza para lograr sus fines. Sin embargo, así como en los ejemplos de violación, robo y asesinato citados aneteriormente, el reclamo de que es universalmente preferible utilizar la fuerza se invalida a sí misma inmediatamente. Para ser capáz de utilizar la fuerza contra otra persona se requiere que esa persona se someta a la fuerza – en otras palabras, para que una persona sea moral, la otra persona debe ser inmoral, que no se puede sostener. También, si la otra persona se *somete* a la fuerza, no es la fuerza – la cual debe *resistir*, que requiere que él se resista de manera correcta para poder ser correcto, lo cual es auto contradictorio. 

Además, si es siempre preferible utilizar la fuerza, entonces los crímenes como la violación y el asesinato se convierten en irrelevantes, porque si es siempre preferible utilizar la fuerza, entonces hacer el amor se convierte en inmoral, y la violación en moral – pero sólo para el violador, mientras que *someterse* a la violencia, en vez de la violencia como tal, se convierte en moral para su víctima, lo cual es una contradicción.

Si, por otra parte, decimos que la violencia es mala, entonces abrimos la posibilidad de la autodefensa. Si es una declaración cómplice del CUP decir que la violencia es malvada, entonces sabemos que, como la malicia puede ser evitada utilizando la violencia, el uso de la violencia para *oponerse* a la violencia es moralmente válido.

Así, como sabemos que la violencia es mala, sabemos que podemos utilizar la fuerza para oponerse a ella. Si definimos una acción como malvada, pero también evitamos que cualquiera actúe contra ella, entonces ya no somos filósofos morales, sino arqueólogos críticos. Esto sería semejante a una teoría médica que dice que la enfermedad es mala, pero es malo intentar prevenirla o curarla – lo cual no tendría ningún sentido.

Además, si los seres humanos no pueden actuar de manera válida para prevenir daños a sí mismos, entonces acciones como inoculaciones, utilizar guantes en el frío, colocarse protector solar o repelente de insectos, construir muros para prevenir deslizamientos de tierra, cepillarse los dientes, utilizar zapatos y así sucesivamente son todas acciones inmorales. Si regresamos a Bob y Doug, y les damos el argumento moral de que la autodefensa es siempre mala, ¿qué resulta?

Pues, creamos otra paradoja. La autodefensa es el uso de la violencia para prevenir la violencia. Si la auodefensa es siempre incorrecta, entonces ésta no puede ser "infligida" de manera violenta sobre un atacante. Sin embargo, preferencias que no pueden ser infligidas sobre otros caen dentro de la categoría de moralmente neutro. Colocar la violencia de la autodefensa dentro de estas categorías significa que la violencia no puede ser infligida a otros – pero la naturaleza de la violencia es que *es* infligida a otros, y así este enfoque resulta en un exceso de contradicciones.

La autodefensa no puede ser "malvada", debido a que la maldad por definición puede ser prevenida a través de la fuerza. Sin embargo, la autodefensa es una respuesta a la iniciación de la fuerza, y así no puede ser evitada a través de la fuerza, no más que detener el movimiento de una pelota de fútbol que pateandola violentamente.

La autodefensa tampoco puede se un comportamiento *requerido*, ya que un comportamiento requerdio como ("no violes") puede ser forzado a través de la violencia, lo cual significaría que cualquiera que falle defenderse de manera violenta puede ser legítimamente agredido. Sin embargo, alguien que falle en defenderse *ya* está siendo agredido, y entonces terminamos en una situación circular donde todos pueden legítimamente actual violento contra una persona que no se está defendiendo, que no es sólo ilógico, sino moralmente detestable.

Si Bob ataca a Doug, pero es completamente incorrecto para Doug utilizar la violencia para defenderse, entonces la violencia termina siendo colocada en dos categorías morales – la iniciacióń de la fuerza es moralmente buena, pero la autodefensa es moralmente malvada, lo cual no puede sostenerse de acuerdo al CUP.

Sin embargo, usted podría discutir, ¿no se supone que la proposición de que la autodefensa es buena también convierte a la violencia tanto buena como mala al mismo tiempo – la violencia que es utilizada para atacar es mala, pero la violencia que se usa para la autodefensa es buena?

Ésta es una objeción interesante – sin embargo, si la iniciación de la fuerza es malvada, entonces puede ser prohibida utilizando la fuerza, debido a que esa es una de las definiciones de la maldad que trabajamos anteriormente.

Así es imposible para cualquier teoría moral lógica rechazar la validez de la autodefensa.

### Child Raising

Instinctively, we generally understand that there is something quite wrong with parents who do not feed their babies. To conceive a child, carry a child to term, give birth to the child, and then leave it lying in its crib to starve to death, severely offends our sensibilities.

Of course, our offence is in no way a moral argument, but it is an excellent starting place to test a moral theory.

Before, when we were talking about UPB, we noted that, where there are exceptions in UPB, there must be objective differences in biology. Or, to put it more accurately, where there are objective differences in biology, there may be rational exceptions or differences in UPB. A child of five has a biologically immature brain and nervous system, and thus cannot rationally process the long-term consequences of his actions. It is the immature brain that is the key here, insofar as if an adult male is retarded to the point where his brain is the equivalent to that of a five year old, he would also have a reduced responsibility for his actions.

Thus when we point to situations of reduced responsibility, we are not *taking away* responsibility that exists, but rather recognising a situation where responsibility does not exist, at least to some degree. If I say that a man in a wheelchair cannot take the escalator, I am not taking away his right to take the escalator, but merely pointing out that he cannot, in fact, use it. When I say that UPB does not apply to the actions of a five year old, I am not saying that UPB is subjective, any more than a height requirement for a roller coaster somehow makes the concept of “tall” subjective.

If I voluntarily enter into a contract with you wherein I promise to pay your bills for a year, I have not signed myself into slavery, but I certainly have taken on a positive obligation that I am now responsible for.

If I run a nursing home, and I take in patients who are unable to feed themselves, then if I do not feed those patients, I am responsible for their resulting deaths. No one is *forcing* me to take in these patients, but once I have expressed a desire and a willingness to take care of them, then I am responsible for their continued well-being.

In the same way, if I borrow your lawnmower, I am obligated to bring it back in more or less the same state that it was when I borrowed it. Similarly, if I go to a pet store and buy a dog, I have taken on a voluntary obligation to take care of that dog. This does not mean that I am now the dog’s slave until the day it dies, but it does mean that as long as the dog is in my possession, I have a responsibility to try to keep it healthy.

These kinds of implicit contracts are quite common in life. We do not sign a contract with a restaurateur when we go to eat a meal in his restaurant; it is simply understood that we will pay before we leave. I have never signed a contract when I walk into a store promising not to shoplift, but they have the right to prosecute me if I do. I also have never signed a contract promising not to rape a woman if we go on a date, yet such a “contract” certainly exists, according to UPB.

If I run a nursing home, and disabled people rely on me to feed them, if I prove unable to feed them for some reason, then my responsibility is clearly to find somebody else who will feed them. The grave danger is not that *I* don’t feed them, but rather that everyone else thinks that I *am* feeding them, and so do not provide them food. This accords with an old moral argument about diving into a river to save someone from drowning. I am not obligated to dive into a river to save someone from drowning, but the moment that I do – or state my intention openly – then I am responsible for trying to save that person, for the very practical reason that everyone else thinks that I am going to save that person, and so may not take direct action themselves.

Thus it is assumed that parents will feed and take care of their newborn baby. If said parents decide against such care-giving, then they are obligated to give the child up to other people who *will* care for it, or face the charge of murder, just as the manager of a home for the disabled must either feed those who utterly depend on him, or give them up to someone who will. If I decide that I no longer want to take care of my dog, I must find him another home, not simply let him starve to death.

This all relies on the principle of third-party self-defence, which is fully supported by the framework of UPB, since the right of self-defence is universal. If I see a man in a wheelchair being attacked by a woman, I have the right to defend him – and this is all the more true if he lacks the capacity to defend himself.

Since children cannot feed themselves, earn a living or live independently, they are the moral equivalent of kidnap victims, or the wife we talked about before whose husband locked her in the basement. Children also lack the capacity for effective self-defence, due to their small stature and near-complete dependence upon their parents.

Thus since it is certainly the case that we have the right to act in self-defence for someone else – and that right becomes even stronger if that person cannot act in his own self-defence, it is perfectly valid to use force against parents who do not feed their children, just as it is perfectly valid to use force against the husband who is starving his wife to death by locking her in the basement.

As we also mentioned above, the less able a victim is to avoid the situation, the worse the crime is. Even the wife who ends up locked in the basement has at least *some* ownership in the matter, because she chose to marry this evil lunatic to begin with. Once she is locked in the basement, the situation is unavoidable, yet there were doubtless many clues hinting at her husband’s abusive nature, from the day she first met him.

Children, however, are the ultimate victims, because they never had any chance to avoid the situations they find themselves in. Thus we can logically establish the responsibility of parents towards their children by using the UPB framework. Since every person is responsible for the effects of his or her body, and children are an effect of the body, then parents are responsible for their children. Since everyone has the right to self-defence, for themselves and for others – since it is a universal right – then anyone can act to defend children. Since everyone must fulfil voluntary obligations, and having children is a voluntary obligation, parents must fulfil those obligations related to children. Since, through inaction, causing the death of someone completely dependent upon you is the equivalent of murder, parents are liable for such a crime.

We could of course put forward the proposition that parents do not have to take care of their children, but that is far too specific a principle to be a moral premise – it would be the same as saying “parents can murder,” which is not UPB-compliant, and so would require a biological differentiation to support an exception – and becoming a parent does not utterly overturn and reverse one’s biological nature.

Parents who starve a child to death are clearly guilty of murder. Children are born into this world in a state of involuntary imprisonment within the family – this does not mean that the family is evil, or corrupt – it is simply a statement of biological fact. Children are by the parents’ choice enslaved to the parents – this form of biological incarceration puts negligent parents in the same moral position as a kidnapper who allows his captive to starve to death, or a nurse who lets her utterly-dependent patients die of thirst.

### "Don't Eat Fish"

What would be the status of the moral proposition: “It is evil to eat fish”?

Clearly, this proposition seems to satisfy at least some of the requirements of UPB – it appears universal, independent of time and place, and relatively objective.

Yet it seems hard for us to reasonably call this a truly *moral* theory – why?

First of all, “evil” encompasses actions that can be prevented through the use of force. Rape is “evil,” and so I can use force to defend myself against someone attempting to rape me.

Can I justly shoot someone who eats a piece of fish?

It would seem silly to argue that I can – but why?

There are some objective limits to the universality of this doctrine. For instance, some people may have no access to fish – they may live in a desert, say – while others live by a lake teeming with fish, and find it hard or impossible to survive without eating them. However, that can’t be quite enough, since we have already accepted the fact that the inability of a eunuch to rape does not invalidate the moral proposition “it is evil to rape.”

No, the “red herring” in the moral proposition “It is evil to eat fish” is the word “*fish*.”

A scientist cannot validly say that his theory of gravity only applies to pink rocks. Since his theory involves gravity, it must apply to *all* entities that have mass.

Similarly, in the example above, UPB accepts only the *act* of eating, and rejects *what* is being eaten, since what is being eaten is not an *action*, but rather what is being acted upon.

In the same way, an ethicist cannot validly put forward the moral proposition: “It is evil to rape the *elderly*.” “Rape” is the behaviour; whether the victim is elderly or not is irrelevant to the moral proposition, since as long as the victim is human, the requirement for universality remains constant. “Thou shalt not steal” is a valid moral proposition according to UPB – “thou shalt not steal *turnips*” is not, for the simple reason that theft is related to the concept of property – and turnips, as a subset of property, cannot be rationally delineated from all other forms of property and assigned their own moral rule.

The moral proposition “eating fish is evil” thus fails the test of universality because it is too specific to be generalised – it is like saying “my theory of gravity applies only to pink rocks.” If it is a theory of gravity, then it must apply to everything; if it only applies to pink rocks, then it is not a theory of gravity.

UPB also rejects as invalid any theory that results in opposing moral judgements for identical actions. “Assault” cannot be moral one day, and immoral the next. Thus we know that “eating” cannot be moral one day, and immoral the next.

Either “eating” is moral, immoral, or morally neutral. If eating is immoral, then a whole host of logical problems arise, which I am sure we are quite familiar with by now.

If, on the other hand, eating is *moral*, then it cannot be moral to eat a cabbage, and immoral to eat a fish, since that is a violation of universality, insofar as the same action – eating – is judged both good and bad.

It is in this way that we understand that the proposition “eating *fish* is evil” fails the test of UPB, and is not valid as a moral theory.

### Animal Rights

We do not have the time here to go into a full discussion of the question of animal rights, but we can at least deal with the moral proposition: “it is evil to kill fish.”

If it is evil to kill fish, then UPB says that anyone or anything that kills the fish is evil. This would include not just fishermen, but sharks as well – since if killing fish is evil, we have expanded our definition of ethical “actors” to include non-human life.

It is clear that sharks do not have the capacity to refrain from killing fish, since they are basically eating machines with fins.

Thus we end up with the logical problem of “inevitable evil.” If it is evil to kill fish, but sharks cannot avoid killing fish, then sharks are “inevitably evil.” However, as we have discussed above, where there is no choice – where *avoidability* is impossible – there can be no morality. Thus the proposition “it is evil to kill fish” attempts to define a universal morality that includes non-moral situations, which cannot stand logically.

Also, the word “fish” remains problematic in the formulation, since it is too specific to be universal. The proper UPB reformulation is: “it is evil for people to kill living organisms.”

If, however, it is evil to kill, we again face the problem of “inevitable evil.” No human being can exist without killing other organisms such as viruses, plants, or perhaps animals. Thus “human life” is defined as “evil.” But if human life is defined as evil, then it cannot *be* evil, since avoidance becomes impossible.

What if we say: “it is evil to kill people” – would that make a man-eating shark evil?

No – once again, since sharks have no capacity to avoid killing people, they cannot be held responsible for such actions, any more than a landslide can be taken to court if it kills a man.

UPB allows for exceptions based on objective and universal material or biological differences, just as other sciences do. The scientific theory that gases expand when heated applies, of course, only to gases. I cannot invalidate the theory by proving that it does not apply to, say, plastic.

In the same way, morality only applies to rational consciousness, due to the requirement for avoidability. If I attempt to apply a moral theory to a snail, a tree, a rock, or the concept “numbers,” I am attempting to equate rational consciousness with entities that may be neither rational nor conscious, which is a logical contradiction. I might as well say that the Opposite Angle Theorem in geometry is invalid because it does not apply to a circle, or a cloud. The OAT only applies to intersecting lines – attempting to apply it to other situations is the conceptual equivalent of attempting to paint air.

In other words, misapplication is not disproof.

There are many other “grey areas” that we could work on, from abortion to intellectual property rights to restitution and so on, but I think that it is far more important to take UPB out of the realm of abstraction, and begin applying it to the real world problems we face today.
