毫无疑问，税收必然会降低生产，并使消费者的生活水平降低。无论采用何种方式，都无法逃避税收是阻碍财富形成并由此产生相对贫困的手段。

这让我想到了我的第二个主题:税收社会学。如果税收是毁灭财富形成的工具，那么问题马上就会变成关于如何解释税收的问题;这是越来越多了;我们所经历的，特别是在过去的一百年中，不仅在绝对而且在相对水平的税收方面稳步增长;而在这一过程中，在西方世界的税收制度中，这些机构，同时在国际政治舞台上扮演了更强大的角色，并逐渐占据了整个世界的主导地位。

有了这些问题，就有了经济学理论的领域。经济学回答了问题"如果引入税收会有什么后果?”它从对行动意义的理解和作为一种特定类型的行为的税收的意义来推断它的答案。为什么存在税收是心理学、历史或社会学的主题。经济学，或更确切地说行为学，认识到所有的行为都是由思想决定的，正确的或不正确的，好的或坏的。但它并没有试图解释这些想法是什么以及人们是如何持有或改变它们的。相反地，它假设它们是给定的，并且旨在解释从作用于它们的逻辑结果，不管它们是什么。历史和社会学问这些想法是什么,人们如何来招待他们,以及他们为什么这样做。[^ 16]

在高度抽象的层面上，对于为什么会有不断增加的税收的问题的答案是这样的:这是在公众舆论中发生的正义观念的缓慢而剧烈的变化。

让我解释一下。一个人可以通过种宅地、生产和承包获得财产，也可以通过征用和剥削家庭、生产者或承包者来获得财产。没有别的办法。[^ 17]两种方法对人类是自然的。除了生产和承包之外，还一直在进行非生产性和非合同物业收购的流程。就像生产性企业可以发展成企业和企业一样，征用和剥削的业务也可以在更大的规模上发展成为政府和国家。[^ 18]这种税收是存在的，而且对于税收的增加也不应令人感到意外。

决定性的问题是，是什么控制并限制了这种生意的规模和发展?

应该清楚的是，对企业的规模限制在没收生产商和承包商的业务上的限制，与那些限制从事生产性交易的公司的规模是完全不同的。与公立选择学校的观点相反，政府和私营企业并没有做同样的生意。他们从事各种截然不同的业务。[^19]

生产企业的规模一方面受到消费者需求的制约(这对可实现的总收入产生了明确的限制)，另一方面是其他生产商的竞争对手所产生的影响，这不断迫使每个公司在其希望保持业务的情况下，以最低的可能成本运作。对于这种规模增长的企业而言，最迫切的消费者必须以最有效的方式服务。只有自愿的消费者购买支持其规模。

其他类型的公司、政府或国家的约束完全不同。首先，说它的大小是由需求决定的，这是荒谬的，就像私人公司的规模是由需求决定的一样。不能说，在任何想象的情况下，那些必须把部分资产交给政府的家庭、生产商和承包商都要求提供这样的服务。相反,他们必须被迫接受它,这是确凿的事实证明服务是不实际的需求。因此,需求不能被认为是限制政府规模。在增长的过程中，国家的发展是在公开的矛盾中发展的

国家也不像生产企业那样受到竞争的限制。与这样的公司不同，政府不应将运营成本维持在最低水平，但可以以高于最低的成本运营，因为它可以通过对其行为征税或调整其成本，将成本转嫁到竞争对手手中。因此，国家的规模也不能被认为受成本竞争约束。在这种情况下，尽管它的成本效益不高，但它还是这样做的。

然而，这并不是说政府的规模不受约束，而国家规模的历史波动只是随机漫步。它只指出，制约企业“政府”的制约因素必须根本不同。

而不是受制于成本和需求条件下,剥削的公司的增长是受到舆论:[^ 20]这不是自愿支持,但从本质上来看雇佣强迫。在同一枚硬币的另一面，胁迫意味着制造受害者，而受害者不是支持者，而是公司规模的主动或被动的抵抗者。可以想象，这种抵抗会在一个人或一群人的情况下，被强行打破，或者是一群人，或者其他两三个人，或者另一群差不多大小的群体。然而，不可思议的是，仅凭这一力量就能解释，在一个熟悉的小少数民族的情况下，在他们的生意中，他们的生意是如何被征用和剥削的，他们的规模是几十个，几百个，甚至是他们的几千倍。[^ 21]要实现这一目标,这样的公司必须有公众支持除了其强制力。大多数人必须接受它的合法经营。这种接纳程度可以从积极主动到消极顺从。但必须接受的是，大多数人必须放弃积极或被动地抵制任何强制实施非生产性和非合同物业收购的想法。大多数人必须主动或被动地支持他们，而不是对这样的行为表现出愤怒，对参与其中的每一个人都表示蔑视，也不采取任何行动来帮助他们成功（更不要说积极地试图阻止他们）。只有在这种情况下，才能够解释少数人如何管理很多人。国家支持的公众舆论必须平衡对受害财产所有者的抵抗程度到积极抵抗的程度是徒劳的。

The state of public opinion also imposes a constraint on the size of the state in another respect. Every firm in the large-scale business of property expropriation must naturally aim to be a monopolist in a definite territory, for one can only prosper in such a business so long as there is something that can be expropriated. However, if competition were allowed in the business of expropriating, there would obviously be nothing left to take. Hence, in order to stay in business, one must be a monopolist.

Even if there is no internal competition, competition between governments operating in *different* territories still exists, and it is this competition that imposes severe limits on the size of government. On the one hand, it opens up the possibility that people may vote with their feet against a government and leave its territory if they perceive other territories as offering less exploitative living conditions. Naturally, each state must see this as a crucial problem, for it literally lives off a population, and any population loss is thus a loss of potential state-income.[^22] Again, the state of public opinion is of utmost importance for maintaining exploitative rule. Only if the state succeeds in generating the impression in the general public that that state’s own territory compares favorably, or at least tolerably well with others will it be able to secure and expand its position.

Public opinion also plays a decisive role in the case of interstate aggression. While not a logical necessity, the nature of a state as an exploitative enterprise still makes it highly likely (not the least because of the just addressed problem of population movements) that it will become engaged in aggression against a “foreign” territory, or that it must defend itself against such aggression from other states.[^23] Moreover, in order to emerge successfully from such interstate wars or warlike actions, a state must be in command of sufficient (in relative terms) economic resources that alone make its actions sustainable. However, these resources can only be provided by a productive population. Thus, to secure the means necessary to win wars and avoid being confronted with slackening productive outputs while at war, public opinion again turns out to be the decisive variable controlling the size of government. Only if popular support for the state’s war exists can it be sustained and possibly won.

Finally, the state of public opinion limits the size of government in yet a third way. While the state maintains its position vis-à-vis the exploited population through coercion and the successful management of public opinion, to maintain its own internal order, which regulates the relationships between the various branches of government and its employees, there is nothing else at its disposal but public opinion, for clearly, no one outside the state exists who could enforce its internal rules upon it. Rather, the enforcement must be accomplished exclusively by means of supportive public opinion among state employees themselves in the various branches of government.[^24] That is, the president cannot coerce the general to go to war—in fact, the greater physical strength would probably be on the general’s side; and the general in turn cannot coerce his soldiers to do the fighting and killing—in fact, they could smash him anytime. President and general can only succeed because of favorable intrastate public opinion, and only insofar as the overwhelming majority of the state employees at least passively supports their actions as legitimate. If, in the various branches of government, a large majority of them were strictly opposed to the enforcement of presidential policy, it could not be put into action successfully. The general who thinks most of his troops consider the war illegitimate or who thinks that the Congress, the IRS, the large majority of public educators and the so-called social services regard such actions as outrageous and to be openly opposed, would face an impossible task even if he himself supported the presidential command.[^25]

With public opinion rather than demand and cost conditions thus identified as the constraining force on the size of government, I return to my original explanation of the phenomenon of ever-increasing taxation as “simply” a change in prevailing ideas.

If it is public opinion that ultimately limits the size of an exploitative firm, then an explanation of its growth in purely ideological terms is justified. Indeed, any other explanation, not in terms of ideological changes but of changes in “objective” conditions must be considered wrong. The size of government does not increase because of any objective causes over which ideas have no control and certainly not because there is a demand for it. It grows because the ideas that prevail in public opinion of what is just and what is wrong have changed. What once was regarded by public opinion as an outrage, to be treated and dealt with as such, has become increasingly accepted as legitimate.

What has happened regarding the general public’s conception of justice?[^26]

[^16]: To make this distinction between economics and history or sociology is not to say, of course, that economics is of no importance for these latter disciplines. In fact, economics is indispensable for all other social sciences. While the reverse is not the case, economics can be developed and advanced without historical or sociological knowledge. The only consequence of doing so is that such economics would probably not be very interesting, as it would be written without consideration of real examples or instances of application (as if one were to write on the economics of taxation even though there had never been an actual example of it in all of history), for it would formulate what could not possibly happen in the social world, or what would have to happen provided that certain conditions were in fact fulfilled. Thus, any historical or sociological explanation is logically constrained by the laws as espoused by economic theory, and any account by a historian or sociologist in violation of these laws must be treated as ultimately confused. On the relationship between economic theory and history see also Ludwig von Mises, *Theory and History* (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1985); Hans-Hermann Hoppe, *Praxeology and Economic Science* (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988).

[^18]: On the theory of the state as developed in the following see—in addition to the works cited in note 17—in particular Herbert Spencer, *Social Statics* (New York: Schalkenbach Foundation, 1970); Auberon Herbert, *The Right and Wrong of Compulsion by the State* (Indianapolis: Liberty Fund, 1978); Albert J. Nock, *Our Enemy, the State* (Tampa, Fla.: Hallberg Publishing, 1983); Murray N.

[^19]: This central idea of the public choice school has been expressed by its foremost representatives as follows:

::::> Both the economic relation and the political relation represent cooperation on the part of two or more individuals. The market and the state are both devices through which co-operation is organized and made possible. Men co-operate through exchange of goods and services in organized markets, and such co-operation implies mutual gain. The individual enters into an exchange relationship in which he furthers his own interest by providing some product or service that is of direct benefit to the individual on the other side of the transaction. At base, political or collective action under the individualistic view of the State is much the same. Two or more individuals find it mutually advantageous to join forces to accomplish certain common purposes. In a very real sense, they “exchange” and devote resources to the construction of the common good. (James M. Buchanan and Gordon Tullock, *The Calculus of Consent* [Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press], p. 192)

::::Surely, the most amazing thing about such a “new theory of politics” is that anyone takes it seriously. Remarks Joseph A. Schumpeter on such views:

::::> The theory which construes taxes on the analogy of club dues or the purchase of the service of, say, a doctor only proves how far removed this part of the social sciences is from scientific habits of mind. (*Capitalism, Socialism and Democracy* [New York: Harper, 1942], p. 198)

::::And H.L. Mencken has this to say regarding a thesis such as Buchanan’s and Tullock’s:

::::> The average man, whatever his errors otherwise, at least sees clearly that government is something lying outside him and outside the generality of his fellow men—that it is a separate, independent and often hostile power, only partly under his control, and capable of doing him great harm…. Is it a fact of no significance that robbing the government is everywhere regarded as a crime of less magnitude than robbing an individual, or even a corporation? … When a private citizen is robbed a worthy man is deprived of the fruits of his industry and thrift; when the government is robbed the worst that happens is that certain rogues and loafers have less money to play with than they had before. The notion that they have earned that money is never entertained; to most sensible men it would seem ludicrous. They are simply rascals who, by accidents of law, have a somewhat dubious right to a share in the earnings of their fellow men. When that share is diminished by private enterprise the business is, on the whole, far more laudable than not. (*A Mencken Chrestomathy* [New York: Vintage Books, 1949] pp. 146–47)

[^20]: See on this also Murray N. Rothbard, “The Anatomy of the State” in idem, *Egalitarianism as a Revolt Against Nature and Other Essays* (Washington, D.C.: Libertarian Review Press, 1974), esp. pp. 37–42.

[^21]: It might be thought that the government could accomplish such a feat by merely improving its weaponry: by threatening with atomic bombs instead of with guns and rifles, so to speak. However, since realistically one must assume that the technological know-how of such improved weaponry can hardly be kept secret, especially if it is in fact applied, then with the state’s improved instruments for instilling fear the victims’ ways amid means of resisting improve as well. Hence, such advances must be ruled out as an explanation of what must be explained.

[^22]: Witness the all-too-numerous states that go so far as to shoot everyone down without mercy who has committed no other sin than that of trying to leave a territory and move elsewhere!

[^23]: On the intimate relationship between state and war see the important study by Ekkehart Krippendorff, *Staat und Krieg* (Frankfurt/M.: Suhrkamp, 1985); also Charles Tilly, “War Making and State Making as Organized Crime” in Peter Evans et al., eds., *Bringing the State Back In* (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1985).

[^24]: This insight (which refutes all talk about the impossibility of anarchism in showing that intra-governmental relations are, in fact, a case of—political—anarchy) has been explained in a highly important article by Alfred G. Cuzán, “Do We Ever Really Get Out of Anarchy”, *Journal of Libertarian Studies* 3, no. 2 (1979).

::::> Wherever earthly governments are established or exist, anarchy is officially prohibited for all members of society, usually referred to as subjects or citizens. They can no longer relate to each other on their own terms…. Rather, all members of society must accept an external “third party”—a government—into their relationships, a third party with the coercive powers to enforce its judgments and punish detractors…. However, such a “third party” arrangement for society is non-existent among those who exercise the power of government themselves. In other words, there is no “third party” to make and enforce judgments among the individual members who make up the third party itself. The rulers still remain in a state of anarchy *vis-à-vis* each other. They settle disputes *among themselves*, without regard for a Government (an entity outside themselves). Anarchy still exists. Only whereas without government it was market or natural anarchy, it is now a *political* anarchy, an anarchy inside power. (Cuzán, pp. 152–53)

[^25]: One of the classic expositors of this idea is David Hume. In his essay, “Of The First Principles of Government”, he writes:

::::> Nothing appears more surprising to those, who consider human affairs with a philosophical eye, than the easiness with which the many are governed by the few; and the implicit submission, with which men resign their own sentiments and passions to those of their rulers. When we enquire by what means this wonder is effected, we shall find, that as FORCE is always on the side of the governed, the governors have nothing to support them but opinion. It is therefore, on opinion only that government is founded; and this maxim extends to the most despotic and most military governments, as well as to the most free and most popular. The soldan of EGYPT, or the emperor of ROME, might drive his harmless subjects, like brute beasts, against their sentiments and inclination: but he must, at least, have led his *mamalukes*, or *praetorian bands*, like men, by their opinion.
