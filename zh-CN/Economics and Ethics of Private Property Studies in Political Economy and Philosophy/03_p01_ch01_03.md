第三, 任何曾见过国营警察局和法院, 更不用说监狱的人, 都知道, 用于为我们提供这种安全保障的生产要素被过度使用、被严重维护和肮脏不堪。由于没有人使用这些生产要素实际拥有它们(没有人可以出售它们，并且私下里适当地出售)，而在资本中所体现的价值的损失(和收益)是社会化的，每个人都倾向于增加他的私人收入，因为这些因素是以牺牲资本价值为代价的。因此，边际成本将逐渐超过边际产品的价值，而资本的过度使用将会产生。在特殊情况下,如果发生这种情况不是如此,过度使用不应明显,然后这才可能在成本相对更高的比任何类似的私营企业。

毫无疑问，垄断安全生产系统中所有的这些问题都将很快得以解决，一旦有了对安全服务的需求，市场竞争对手的激励机制就完全不同了。这并不是说要找到解决安全问题的“完美”方案。仍然会有抢劫和谋杀;并不是所有的抢掠品都能被追回，也不是所有的杀人犯都能被抓到。但就消费者的评估而言，情况将会改善到人的本性会允许其改善的程度。首先，只要有竞争体系(例如:只要安全服务的生产者根据自愿购买而定，其中的大多数可能采取事先同意的服务和保险合同的形式，在任何实际“出现”不安全和侵略的情况下)，没有生产者可以增加其收入，而不改善消费者对产品的服务或产品质量。此外，所有的安全生产者综合起来都不能支持其特定行业的重要性，除非出于无论何种原因，消费者实际上开始比其他商品更高度地评估安全性，从而确保安全生产永远不会以不生产或减少的生产为代价，比如说，奶酪，即作为竞争的私人货物。此外，安全服务的生产商将不得不将他们的产品多样化多样化，因为大量的消费者对安全产品的需求非常多样化。直接依赖于消费者的自愿支持，他们会立即受到经济上的伤害如果他们不适当回应消费者的各种需求或需求的变化。因此每个消费者将有直接影响,虽然小,但在输出的商品从证券市场出现或消失。而不是提供一个统一的“安全包”,一个国家生产政策的特点,大量的服务套餐将出现在市场上。他们会根据不同的人的安全需求，考虑不同的职业，不同的风险行为，不同的保护和保险需求，以及不同的地理位置和时间约束。

但这还远远不够。除了多样化之外,产品的内容和质量也会提高。不仅安全企业的员工对消费者的待遇会立即改善，“我可以不关心”的态度、任意性、甚至残暴，现在的警察和司法系统的疏忽和缓慢也会最终消失。由于警察和法官会依赖于自愿的消费者支持，任何对消费者的虐待，不礼貌或荒谬的行为都可能让他们丢掉工作。更进一步，客户和他的商业伙伴之间的争端的解决方式总是被委托给后者的判断，几乎肯定会从书中消失，独立方派的冲突仲裁将成为安全的生产者提供标准。最重要的是，为了吸引和留住客户，这些服务的生产者必须提供合同，这些合同将允许消费者知道自己购买的是什么，并且如果安全生产商的实际性能没有达到合同，使他能有效地、主观地肯定地提出投诉。更确切地说，在他们并不是个性化的服务合同中，客户只需要支付自己的风险，而只是保险合同，这是一种保险合同要求与他人共同承担风险，而与现在的统计结果相反的是，这些合同将不再包含任何刻意的内部再分配方案偏袒一群人以牺牲另一群人的利益。否则，如果有人觉得合同要求他支付他人的特殊需要和风险因素(可能不安全的因素)，即他不认为适用于他自己的情况，他将拒绝签字或中止付款。

然而，当这一切都被提及时，问题将不可避免地浮出水面。不竞争系统的安全生产必然导致永久性的社会冲突,混乱和无政府状态?对于这个问题，我们可以做出一些回应。首先，应该注意的是，这种印象决不是与历史经验证据相一致的。系统竞争法院存在在不同的地方(例如,在古老的爱尔兰或汉萨同盟)的现代民族国家的到来之前,据我们所知他们运作得很好。[^27]根据当时存在的犯罪率(人均犯罪率)，在所谓的“蛮荒西部”(顺便说一下，它并不像某些电影所暗示的那样疯狂)的私人警察比现在的政府支持的警察要成功得多。[^28] 再看看当代的经验和例子，数以百万计的国际合同甚至已经存在贸易和旅行的合同——比如，比方说，有更多的欺诈，更多的犯罪，比国内关系更严重的违约，这似乎是夸大其词。他们的研究似乎证实他们的论文,比公共同行更成功地解决社会冲突，而不是更少。

However, this historical evidence is very much subject to dispute, in particular regarding whether any general information can be derived from it. Yet there are systematic reasons, too, why the fear expressed by the question is not well-founded. Paradoxical as it may seem, establishing a competitive system of security producers implies erecting an institutionalized incentive structure to produce an order of law and law-enforcement that embodies the highest possible degree of consensus regarding the question of conflict resolution. Such a structure will tend to generate less rather than more social unrest and conflict than would occur under monopolistic auspices.[^29] In order to understand this paradox, it is necessary to take a closer look at the only typical situation that concerns the skeptic and that allows him to believe in the superior virtue of a monopolistically organized order of security production: when a conflict arises between A and B, both are insured by different companies and the companies cannot come to an immediate agreement regarding the validity of the conflicting claims brought forward by their respective clients. (No problem would exist if such an agreement were reached or if both clients were insured by one and the same company—at least the problem then would not be different in any way from that emerging under a statist monopoly.) Would not such a situation always result in a shoot-out? This is highly unlikely. First, any violent battle between companies would be costly and risky, in particular if these companies had reached a respectable size (which would be important for them to have in order to appear as effective guarantors of security to their prospective clients in the first place). More importantly, under a competitive system with each company dependent on the continuation of voluntary consumer payments, any battle would have to be deliberately supported by each and every client of both companies. If there were only one person who withdrew his payments because he was not convinced a battle was necessary in the particular conflict at hand, there would be immediate economic pressure on the company to look for a peaceful solution to the conflict.[^30] Hence any competitive producer of security would be extremely cautious about engaging in violent measures in order to resolve conflicts. Rather, to the extent that it is peaceful conflict resolution that consumers want, each and every security producer would go to great lengths to provide it to its clients and to establish in advance, for everyone to know, to what arbitration process it would be willing to submit itself and its clients in case of a disagreement over the evaluation of conflicting claims. And as such a scheme could appear to the clients of different firms to be working only if there were agreement among them regarding such arbitrational measures, a system of law governing relations between companies that would be universally acceptable to the clients of all of the competing security producers would naturally evolve. Moreover, the economic pressure to generate rules representing a consensus on how conflicts should be handled is even more farreaching. Under a competitive system, the independent arbitrators who would be entrusted with the task of finding peaceful solutions to conflicts would be dependent on the continued support of the two disputing companies insofar as the companies could and would select different judges if either one of them were sufficiently dissatisfied with the outcome of the arbitration work. Thus, these judges would be under pressure to find solutions to the problems handed over to them that, this time not with respect to the procedural aspects of law but its content, would be acceptable to all of the clients of the firms involved.[^31] Otherwise one or all of the companies might lose customers, thus inducing those firms to turn to different arbitrators the next time they are in need of one.[^32]

But wouldn’t it be possible under a competitive system for a security producing firm to become an outlaw company—a firm, that is, which, supported by its own clients, started aggressing against others? There is certainly no way to deny that this might be possible, though again it must be emphasized that here one is in the realm of empirical social science and no one could know such a thing with certainty. And yet the tacit implication that the possibility that a security firm could become an outlaw company somehow indicates a severe deficiency in the philosophy and economics of a pure capitalist social order is fallacious.[^33]

First, it should be recalled that any social system, a statist-socialist order no less than a pure market economy, is dependent for its continued existence on public opinion and that a given state of public opinion at all times delimits what can or cannot occur as well as what is more or less likely to occur. The current state of public opinion in West Germany, for instance, makes it highly unlikely or even impossible that a statist-socialist system of the current Soviet type could be imposed on the West German public. The lack of public support for such a system would doom it to failure and make it collapse. It is even more unlikely that any attempt to impose a Soviet-type order could ever hope to succeed among Americans, given American public opinion. Hence, in order for us to see the problem of outlaw companies correctly, the above question should be phrased as follows: How likely is it that any such event would occur in a given society with its specific state of public opinion? Formulated in this way, it is clear that the answer would have to be different for different societies. For some, characterized by socialist ideas deeply entrenched in the public, there would be a greater likelihood of the reemergence of aggressor companies, and for other societies there would be a much smaller chance of this happening. But then, would the prospect of a competitive system of security production in any given case be better or worse than that of the continuation of a statist system? Let us look, for instance, at the present-day United States. Assume that by a legislative act the state had abolished its right to provide security with tax funds and a competitive system of security production was introduced. Given the state of public opinion, how likely then would it be that outlaw producers would spring up, and what if they did? Evidently, the answer would depend on the reactions of the public to this changed situation. Thus, the first reply to those challenging the idea of a private market for security would have to be: What about you? What would your reaction be? Does your fear of outlaw companies mean that you would then go out and engage in trade with a security producer that aggressed against other people and their property, and would you continue supporting it if it did? Certainly the critic would be much muted by this counterattack. But more important than this is the systematic challenge implied in this personal counterattack. Evidently, the described change in the situation would imply a change in the cost-benefit structure that everyone would face once he had to make his decisions. Before the introduction of a competitive system of security production, it had been legal to participate in and support (state) aggression. Now such an activity would be illegal. Hence, given one’s conscience, which makes each decision appear more or less costly (i.e., more or less in harmony with one’s own principles of correct behavior), support for a firm engaging in the exploitation of people unwilling to deliberately support its actions would be more costly than before. Given this fact, it must be assumed that the number of people (including even those who otherwise would have readily lent their support to the state) who would now spend their money to support a firm committed to honest business would rise wherever this social experiment was tried. In contrast, the number of people still committed to a policy of exploitation—of gaining at the expense of others—would fall. How drastic this effect would be would of course depend on the state of public opinion. In the example at hand—the United States, where the natural theory of property is extremely widespread and accepted as a private ethic, the libertarian philosophy being essentially the ideology on which the country was founded and that led it to the height it reached[^34]—the effect would naturally be particularly pronounced. Accordingly, security producing firms committed to the philosophy of protecting and enforcing libertarian law would attract the greatest bulk of public support and financial assistance. And while it may be true that some people, and among them especially those who have profited from the old order, might continue their support of a policy of aggression, it is very unlikely that they would be sufficient in number and financial strength to succeed in doing so. Rather, the likely outcome would be that the honest companies would develop the strength needed—alone or in a combined effort and supported in this effort by their own voluntary customers—to check any such emergence of outlaw producers and destroy them wherever and whenever they came into existence.[^35]

[^26]: Sums up Molinari, *Production of Security,* pp. 13–14,

> If … the consumer is not free to buy security wherever he pleases, you forthwith see open up a large profession dedicated to arbitrariness and bad management. Justice becomes slow and costly, the police vexatious, individual liberty is no longer respected, the price of security is abusively inflated and inequitably apportioned, according to the power and influence of this or that class of consumers.

[^30]: Contrast this with the state’s policy of engaging in battles without having everyone’s deliberate support because it has the right to tax people; and ask yourself if the risk of war would be lower or higher if one had the right to stop paying taxes as soon as one had the feeling that the states’ handling of foreign affairs was not to one’s liking.

[^31]: And it may be noted here again that norms that incorporate the highest possible degrees of consensus are, of course, those that are presupposed by argumentation and whose acceptance makes consensus on anything at all possible, as indicated above.

[^32]: Again, contrast this with state-employed judges who, because they are paid from taxes and so are relatively independent of consumer satisfaction, can pass judgments that are clearly not acceptable as fair by everyone; and ask yourself if the risk of not finding the truth in a given case would be lower or higher if one had the possibility of exerting economic pressure whenever one had the feeling that a judge who one day might have to adjudicate in one’s own case had not been sufficiently careful in assembling and judging the facts of a case, or simply was an outright crook.

[^35]: Naturally, insurance companies would assume a particularly important role in checking the emergence of outlaw companies. Note Morris and Linda Tannehill (*The Market of Liberty*, pp. 110–11):

> Insurance companies, a very important sector of any totally free economy, would have a special incentive to dissociate themselves from any aggressor and, in addition, to bring all their considerable business influence to bear against him. *Aggressive violence causes value loss*, and the insurance industry would suffer the major cost in most such value losses. An unrestrained aggressor is a walking liability, and no insurance company, however remotely removed from his original aggression, would wish to sustain the risk that he might aggress against one of its own clients next. Besides, aggressors and those who associate with them are more likely to be involved in situations of violence and are, thus, bad insurance risks. An insurance company would probably refuse coverage to such people out of a foresighted desire to minimize any future losses which their aggression might cause. But even if the company were not motivated by such foresight, it would still be forced to rate their premiums up drastically or cancel their coverage altogether in order to avoid carrying the extra risk invoked in their inclination to violence. In a competitive economy, no insurance company could afford to continue covering aggressors and those who had dealings with aggressors and simply pass the cost on to its honest customers; it would soon lose these customers to more reputable firms which could afford to charge less for their insurance coverage.
