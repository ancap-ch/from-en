## 银行业、民族国家和国际政治:当前经济秩序的社会学重构

### 货币银行学

为了解释物物交换的出现，只需要一个狭隘定义的利己主义的假设就可以了。如果人们喜欢更多的选择和商品，那么他就会选择物物交换和劳动分工而不是自给自足。

以物易物的货币的出现，源于同样的狭隘的私利，如果人被整合在物物交换的经济中，而更倾向于更低的生活水平，他将选择并支持一种共同的交换媒介。 在选择一种货币时，他可以克服以物易物交换经济所带来的基本限制。这就要求有双重巧合需求的存在。有了钱，他交换的可能性就变大了。每一件商品都可以互相交换，独立于双重巧合或不完美分歧。随着交换范围的扩大，他所拥有的每一件物品的价值都在增加。

如果人们集成在一个交换经济中,利益将会迫使他去寻找具有理想的货币属性的适销产品，例如，可分性、耐用性、可辩认性、便携性和稀缺性，并且这种商品的需求不是为了自己而是为了使用它们作为交流的媒体。选择这种商品作为他的交易媒介同时也是趋于他自己的利益，因为这种交易方式也将会被其他人普遍使用。事实上，货币的作用是促进交换，扩大交换范围，从而增加商品的价值(在某种程度上，它们被认为是与交换经济一体化的)。因此，商品越广泛地用作货币，它的货币功能就会变得越好。如果仅仅受狭隘的自身利益驱使，人类总是倾向于更普遍的，如果可能的话，是一种普遍的交换媒介，而不是普遍的或非普遍的。因为钱越普遍，一个人的市场就越广泛，一个人的价值和成本计算就越合理(从一个想要经济一体化和财富最大化的人的角度看)，而一个人从劳动分工中获得的好处就越大。[^1]

当然，从经验上来说，曾经被选为“最优”的商品是黄金。如果没有政府的强制，黄金在可预见的未来将再次被选择，因为黄金是最能发挥货币功能的商品。利己主义会让每个人都更喜欢黄金作为一种普遍使用的交换媒介，而非其他货币。在某种程度上,每个认为自己及其财产是集成到交换经济的人,从会计学的角度看，他更喜欢黄金,而不是其他任何形式的钱，这是由于黄金被普遍接受作为机会成本，因此黄金成为了财富最大化的指南。所有其他货币将很快被淘汰，因为任何东西都不会超过一个普遍的国际货币，如黄金国家或地区货币，这将与最初的货币的目的相抵触。钱是由自利的人发明的，目的是为了通过将自己融入一个不断扩大和最终普遍的市场来增加他的财富。在追求自身利益的过程中，国家或地区货币很快就会被黄金取代，因为只有黄金才能使经济一体化和市场全球化。在追求自身利益的过程中，国家或地区的资金很快就会被淘汰，并被黄金所取代，因为只有黄金能够完成经济一体化并在全球范围内销售，从而实现货币作为通用交换媒介的最终功能。[^2]

从最初货币的出现，到更好的货币形式，再到一种普遍的货币，即黄金的出现，释放了以前由于交换过程中的双重巧合而沮丧和闲散的生产力（例如存汇率自由波动的竞争性货币的存在）。在物物交换的情况下，生产者的产量被双重需求所限制。由于所有的价格都是用黄金来表达的，生产市场经常无所不包，而在全球范围内，如果没有双重的巧合，需求就会受到不受限制的影响。因此，产量随之增加——黄金生产的增加比其他任何货币都要多。随着产量的增加，货币的价值也随之上升；货币购买力的提高降低了人们对它的保留需求，同时降低了时间偏好的有效率(原始利率)，并导致了资本的形成。一个上升的螺旋式经济发展进程正在启动.

这种发展为银行成为专门的资金处理机构奠定了基础。一方面，银行为了满足日益增长的对资金的保管、运输和清算的需求而出现。另一方面，他们承担起了促进资本家(储蓄者)和企业家(投资者)之间交流的重任，实际上在这些角色之间的分工很明确。作为存款机构，尤其是储蓄和信贷机构，银行很快就会成为一个经济体的神经中枢。越来越多的空间和时间分配，以及经济资源和活动的协调通过银行这个中介来进行； 在促进这种协调的过程中，银行的出现暗示了经济增长的另一种刺激.[^3]

尽管只有一个通用货币和一个帐户是为大家的共同经济利益考虑,并且人们在追求财富最大化将不会停止,直到达到这个目标,但是，只有一个银行或一个垄断的银行系统与大家的共同利益又是矛盾的。相反，自我利益要求每个银行都使用相同的通用货币 - 而且不同货币之间不存在竞争，但银行和银行系统之间的自由竞争（所有这些都使用黄金）必须存在。只要存在自由进入银行业这一现象，就会像其他业务一样具有成本效益;但只有当这场竞争所涉及的服务以同一货币的形式提供，自由银行实际上才能够实现货币和银行业务的功能，即促进经济一体化而不是解体，拓宽市场和扩大分工而不是限制分工，使价值和成本核算更加合理而不是不那么理性，从而增加而不是减少经济财富。货币之间的竞争概念是一种 *矛盾*。严格来讲，拥有自由浮动汇率的竞争货币的货币体系仍然是一种(部分的)物物交换，这一体系充斥着要求(某些)交易的双重巧合的问题。这种制度的存在是基于对金钱的追逐。[^4] 为了自由追求自身利益，人们会立即抛弃它——这将是一种基本的误解，认为金钱的本质不仅存在于竞争的银行，而且在于竞争性的货币本身。[^5] 竞争性货币不是自由市场行为的产物，而是强制的产物，政府在理性经济行为的道路上设置了障碍。

With free banking based on a universal gold standard emerging, the goal of achieving the most cost efficient solution to coordinating and facilitating interspatial and intertemporal exchanges within the framework of a universally integrated market is accomplished. Prices for the service of safekeeping, transporting and clearing money, as well as for advancing money in time-contracts would drop to their lowest possible levels under a regime of free entry. And since these prices would be expressed in terms of one universal money, they would truly reflect the minimum costs of providing market-integrative services.

Moreover, bank competition combined with the fact that money must emerge as a commodity—such as gold—which in addition to its value as money has a commodity value and thus cannot be produced without significant cost-expenditure, also provides the best possible safeguard against fraudulent banking.

As money depositing institutions, banks—much like other institutions depositing fungible commodities yet more so in the case of banks because of the special role of the commodity money—are tempted to issue “fake” warehouse receipts, i.e., notes of deposit not covered by real money, as soon as such banknotes have assumed the role of money substitutes and are treated by market participants as unquestionable equivalents of actually deposited real money. In this situation, by issuing fake or fiat banknotes that physically cannot be distinguished from genuine money substitutes, a bank can—fraudulently and at another’s expense—increase its own wealth. It can directly purchase goods with such fake notes and thus enrich itself in the same way as any simple counterfeiter does. The bank’s real wealth and the wealth of the early recipients of the money increases through these purchases, and at the same time and by the same action the wealth of those receiving the new money late or not at all decreases, due to the inflationary consequences of counterfeiting. Or a bank can use such fiat money to expand its credit and earn interest on it. Once again a fraudulent income and wealth redistribution in the bank’s favor takes place.[^6] Yet in addition, this time a boom-bust cycle is also set in motion: Placed at a lowered interest rate, the newly granted credit causes increased investments and initially creates a boom that cannot be distinguished from an economic expansion; however, this boom must turn bust because the credit that stimulated it does not represent real savings but instead was created out of thin air. Hence, with the entire new and expanded investment structure under way, a lack of capital must arise that makes the successful completion of all investment projects systematically impossible and instead requires a contraction with a liquidation of previous malinvestments.[^7]

Under the gold standard any bank or banking system (including a monopolist one) would be constrained in its own inclination to succumb to such temptations by two requirements essential for successful counterfeiting. On the one hand, the banking public must not be suspicious of the trustworthiness of the bank—that is, its anti-fraud vigilance must be low for otherwise a bank run would quickly reveal the committed fraud. On the other hand, the bank cannot inflate its notes at such a pace that the public loses confidence in the notes’ purchasing power, reduces its reservation demand for them and flees instead towards “real” values, including real money, and thereby drives the counterfeiter into bankruptcy. Under a system of free banking, however, with no legal tender laws and gold as money, an additional constraint on potential bank fraud arises, for then every bank is faced with the existence of nonclients or clients of different banks. If in this situation additional counterfeit money is brought into circulation by a bank, it must invariably reckon with the fact that the money may end up in nonclients’ hands who demand immediate redemption, which the bank then would be unable to grant without at least a painful credit contraction. In fact, such a corrective contraction could only be avoided if the additional fiat money were to go exclusively into the cash reserves of the bank’s own clients and were used by them exclusively for transactions with other clients. Yet since a bank would have no way of knowing whether or not such a specific outcome could be achieved, or how to achieve it, the threat of a following credit contraction would act as an inescapable economic deterrent to any bank fraud.[^8]

[^8]: What about cartels? Could not the competing banks form a cartel and agree on a joint venture in counterfeiting? Again, under free banking this is most unlikely, because a system of free banking is characterized by the complete absence of any economic incentive for cartelization. With no restrictions of entry in existence, any such bank cartel would have to be classified as voluntary and would suffer from the same problems as any voluntary cartel: Faced with the threat of noncartelists and/or new entrants, and recognizing that like all cartel agreements, a banking cartel would favor the less efficient cartel members at the expense of the more efficient ones, there is simply no economic basis for successful action, and any attempt to cartelize would quickly break down as economically inefficient. Moreover, insofar as the counterfeit money would be employed to expand credit, banks acting in concert would set off a full-scale boom-bust cycle. This, too, would deter cartelization.
