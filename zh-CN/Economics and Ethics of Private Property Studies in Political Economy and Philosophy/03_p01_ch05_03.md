在经典的理论重建之后，尤其是奥地利的就业、金钱、利益和资本主义过程的理论，我现在将转向凯恩斯和他的“新”理论。在我们解释旧的理论前提下，很容易认识到凯恩斯对*一般就业，利息和货币*“新”理论是根本上有缺陷的，凯恩斯主义革命成了二十世纪最重要的知识介丑闻之一。[^23]

#### 就业

凯恩斯提出了一个错误的就业理论。与古典观点相反，他声称自由市场上可能存在非自愿失业; 进一步说，一个市场可以达到稳定的平衡，并有持续的非自愿失业的情况。他声称这样的市场缺陷是可能的，他认为已经发现了干扰市场运作的最终经济原理。

由于自由市场的定义是家庭或私有财产，并私人财产拥有者之间所有的自愿性互动，这该让人清楚：凯恩斯声称的大致相当于把圆圈划成正方。

凯恩斯首先提出了一个错误的陈述，即古典理论假定“严格意义上的非自愿失业并不存在”。[^24] 事实上，从来没有这样的假设。古典理论认为，只要自由市场在运行，非自愿失业在逻辑上是行不可能的。这种非自愿失业，从来没有受到严重的怀疑，任何非自愿失业实际上只可以存在于额外市场机构，最低工资法律等等的之下。
在这种错误之后，凯恩斯继而给出了他对非自愿失业的定义：

>若工资货物[即消费品]价格相对于货币工资的价格有小幅上涨的情况下，人会非自愿失业的，那么愿意为当前货币工资工作的劳动力的总供给量，以及这个工资的总需求量将大于现有的就业量。[^25]

直接说，凯恩斯用他典型的混淆的方式说，如果相对于工资率的价格上涨导致更多的就业，那么人会非自愿失业的。[^26] 然而，相对价格的这种变化在逻辑上相当于实际降低工资水平；工资收入的下降，劳动者可以随时在自由市场上的实际工资上调整，只要他们愿意接受较低的工资水平，而商品价格则保持在原来的水平。如果劳动者决定不这样做，那么在这一切中就没有什么是非自愿的。鉴于他们对劳动力的保留需求，他们选择提供实际供应的劳动量。如果在实际工资率较低的时候，就业数量会增加，那么这种自愿失业就业的分类也不会有所改变。由于逻辑上的原因，只有当劳动者增加了对特定工资率和他们的劳动保留需求的相对评价时，才能产生这样的结果（否则，如果没有发生这种变化，就业就会减少而不是增加）。然而，事实上，人们可以随时改变自己的想法，这并不意味着以前的选择是非自愿的，正如凯恩斯所说的那样。当然，人们可以以任何一种意愿来定义自己的条件，而以真正的奥威尔方式（Orwellian），甚至可以选择自愿的非自愿和非自愿的自愿。然而，通过这种方法，任何在日光之下的东西都可以被“证明”，但实际上没有任何东西被显示出来。凯恩斯证明非自愿失业的可能性只是一种口头的无意义的例证，完全不会影响这样一个事实，就是根本没有这种一般意义上的非自愿就业的事，在这个没有阻碍的市场上永远不会存在。

如果这还不够，凯恩斯就会认为即使在想梦平衡完美的地方也可能会有非自愿失业。事实上，他批评了他他早些时候的*金钱论*，他说：“我当时并没有理解 ，在某些情况下，这个制度可以处于均衡状态，而不需要充分就业。“[^27]然而，平衡*定义*为：在所有行动都被完全被最后的大数据下调整，价值，技术和资源的变化不再发生; 并且，包括劳动力在内的所有生产要素都可以得到最大程度的利用（给定这些是不变的数据），并且在同一个恒定的生产模式下被反复无休止地使用。因此，正如哈兹利特（Hazlitt）所言，凯恩斯在他的*通论*中发现的失业均衡就像是发现了一个三角形的圆圈 - 这是一个矛盾的概念。[^28]

#### 金钱

凯恩斯在对待就业和失业问题上抛弃了逻辑，然后在讨论金钱时抛弃了经济推理，认为货币和货币变化对就业收入和利益能产生有系统性影响的主张。

鉴于“金钱”出现在*通论*的标题之下，凯恩斯的积极的货币理论是非常简短和未成熟的。简洁当然可以是一种美德。就凯恩斯而言，它提供了一个很容易指出他的基本错误的机会。对于凯恩斯来说，“*货币的重要性是流自于它是现在和未来之间的连接。*”[^29] “金钱重要的属性，就是把现在和未来联系起来的一个微妙的手段。 ”[^30] 这是错误的，因为在想梦平衡完美的地方，金钱是不存在的，即使在均衡条件下，仍然存在着现在和将来之分，两者仍然是联系在一起的。金钱作为交换媒介，而不是作为未来的一个联系， 它的角色是与未来的不确定性密不可分。 [^32] 行动总是从现在开始，针对某个未来的目标，从开始的角度来看或多或少有些遥远，却构成了现在与未来之间的真正联系。时间配合普遍类别的行动，为现在和未来之间的这种联系形成了具体的形式。与其他经济现象（如非货币性商品）相比，金钱不能把现在与未来联系起来，是与人的关注相反。他们的现在价值也反映了对未来的期待，不比金钱多或少。

From this first misconception regarding the nature of money, all other misconceptions flow automatically. Being defined as a subtle link between present and future, the demand for money (its supply being given), which Keynes, in line with his general inclination of misinterpreting logical-praxeological categories as psychological ones, terms “liquidity preference” or “propensity to hoard,”[^33] is said to be functionally related to the rate of interest (and vice versa).[^34] “Interest,” writes Keynes, “is the reward of not-hoarding,”[^35] “the reward for parting with liquidity,”[^36] which makes liquidity preference in turn the unwillingness to invest in interest-bearing assets. That this is false becomes obvious as soon as one asks the question “What, then, about prices?” The quantity of beer, for instance, that can be bought for a definite sum of money is obviously no less a reward for parting with liquidity than is the interest rate, which would make the demand for money then the unwillingness to buy beer as much as it is an unwillingness to invest.[^37] Formulated in general terms, the demand for money is the unwillingness to buy or rent nonmoney, including interest-bearing assets (land, labor, and/or capital goods, or future goods) *and* non-interest-bearing assets (consumer or present goods). To recognize this is to recognize that the demand for money has nothing to do with investment or with consumption; nor has it anything to do with the ratio of investment-to-consumption expenditures, or the spread between input and output prices (the discount of higher order or future goods versus lower order or present goods). Increases or decreases in the demand for money, other things being equal, lower or raise the overall level of money prices, but real consumption and investment, as well as the real consumption-investment proportion remain unaffected; and such being the case, employment and social income remain unchanged as well. The demand for money determines the spending/cash balance proportion. The investment/consumption proportion, pace Keynes, is an entirely different and unrelated matter. It is solely determined by time-preference.[^38]

The same conclusion is reached if changes in the supply of money (liquidity preference being given) are considered. Keynes claims that an increase in the supply of money, other things being equal, can have a positive effect on employment. He writes, “so long as there is unemployment, employment will change in the same proportion as the quantity of money.”[^39] Yet this is not only a highly curious pronouncement because it *assumes* the existence of unemployed resources instead of *explaining* why such a thing should possibly occur—for, obviously, a resource can be unemployed only because it is either not recognized as scarce at all and thus has no value whatsoever, or because its owner voluntarily prices it out of the market and its unemployment then is no problem that would call for a solution.[^40]

Even if one were to waive this criticism, the statement would still be fallacious. For if other things were indeed equal, then the additional supply of money would simply lead to increased overall prices and simultaneous and proportional increased wage rates, and nothing would change at all. If, contrary to this, employment should increase, this is only possible if wage rates do not rise along with, and to the same extent as, other prices. However, other things then can no longer be said to be equal, because real wage rates would be lowered, and employment can only rise while real wages fall if the relative evaluation of employment versus self-employment (i.e., unemployment) is assumed to have changed. Yet if this is assumed, no increase in the money supply would have been required. The same result (increased employment) could also have been brought about by laborers accepting lower nominal wage rates.

#### Interest

With logic and economic theory thrown out of the window, in his discussion of the interest phenomenon Keynes abandons reason and common sense entirely.

According to Keynes, since money has a systematic impact on employment, income, and interest, interest, in turn—quite consistently, for that matter—must be conceived of as a purely monetary phenomenon.[^41] I need not explain the elementary fallacy of this view. Suffice it to say here again that money would disappear in equilibrium, but interest would not, which demonstrates that interest must be considered a real, not a monetary phenomenon.

Moreover, Keynes, in talking about “functional relationships” and “mutual determination” of variables instead of causal, unidirectional relations, becomes entangled in inescapable contradictions as regards his theory of interest.[^42] As has been explained above, on the one hand Keynes thinks of liquidity preference (and the supply of money) as *determining* the interest rate, such that an increased demand for money, for instance, would raise the interest rate (and an increased supply of money would lower it) and that this then will reduce investment “whilst a decline in the rate of interest may be expected, *ceteris paribus*, to increase the volume of investment.”[^43] On the other hand, characterizing the interest rate as “the reward for parting with liquidity,” he contends that the demand for money is *determined* by the interest rate, such that a fall in the interest rate, for instance, would increase one’s demand for cash (and also, one should add, one’s propensity to consume) and hence lead to *reduced* investment. Obviously, however, a lower interest rate can hardly both increase and decrease investment at the same time. Something must be wrong here.

Keynes, however, combines falsehood and contradiction into one of the most fantastic conspiracy theories ever heard of.

Since interest, according to Keynes, is a purely monetary phenomenon, it is only natural to assume that it can be manipulated at will through monetary policy (provided, of course, one is not restricted in this by the existence of a 100-percent-reserve commodity money standard such as the gold standard).[^44] “There is,” writes Keynes, “no special virtue in the pre-existing rate of interest.”[^45] In fact, if the supply of money is sufficiently increased, the interest rate supposedly can be brought down to zero. Keynes recognizes that this would imply a superabundance of capital goods, and one would think that this realization should have given him cause to reconsider. Not so! On the contrary, in all seriousness he tells us

> that a properly run community equipped with modern technical resources, of which the population is not increasing rapidly, ought to be able to bring down the marginal efficiency of capital in equilibrium approximately to zero within a single generation.[^46]

It is “comparatively easy to make capital goods so abundant that the marginal efficiency of capital is zero (and) this may be the most sensible way of gradually getting rid of many of the objectional features of capitalism.”[^47] “There are no intrinsic reasons for the scarcity of capital.”[^48] Rather, it is “possible for communal saving through the agency of the State to be maintained at a level where it ceases to be scarce.”[^49]

Don’t worry that this would imply that no maintenance or replacement of capital would be needed any longer (for, if this were the case, capital goods would still be scarce and hence command a price), and capital goods instead would have to be “free goods” in the same sense in which air is usually “free.” Don’t worry that if capital goods were no longer scarce, then consumer goods could no longer be scarce either (for, if they were, the means employed to produce them would have to be scarce, too). And don’t worry that in this Garden of Eden, which Keynes promises to establish within one generation (why so long?!), there would no longer be any use for money. For, as he informs us, “I am myself impressed by the great social advantages of increasing the stock of capital until it ceases to be scarce.”[^50] Who would dare disagree with this! [^51]

Yet more is to come. Because, as Keynes sees it, there are some obstacles on the path toward paradise. For one thing, the gold standard stands in the way, because it makes the expansion of credit impossible (or difficult at least, in that a credit expansion would lead to an outflow of gold and a subsequent economic contraction). Hence Keynes’s repeated polemics against this institution.[^52] Furthermore, there is the just explained problem of his own making: that a lower interest rate supposedly increases and decreases investment simultaneously. And it is to get out of this logical mess that Keynes comes up with a conspiracy theory: For, while the interest rate must be reduced to zero so as to eliminate scarcity, as we were just told, the lower the interest rate the lower also the reward for parting with liquidity. The lower the interest rate, that is to say, the lower the incentive for capitalists to invest, because their profits will be reduced accordingly. Thus, they will try to undermine, and conspire against, any attempt to resurrect the Garden of Eden.

Driven by “animal spirits,”[^53] “gambling instincts,”[^54] and “addicted to the money-making passion,”[^55] they will conspire so “that capital has to be kept scarce enough.”[^56] “The acuteness and peculiarity of our contemporary problem arises, therefore,” writes Keynes,

> out of the possibility that the average rate of interest which will allow a reasonable average level of employment [and of social income] is one so unacceptable to wealth owners that it cannot be readily established merely by manipulating the quantity of money.[^57]

In fact,

> the most stable, and least easily shifted, element in our contemporary economy has been hitherto, and may prove to be in the future, the minimum rate of interest acceptable to the generality of wealth owners.[^58]

Fortunately, we are informed, there is a way out of this predicament; through “the euthanasia of the rentier, and, consequently, the euthanasia of the cumulative oppressive power of the capitalist to exploit the scarcity-value of capital.”[^59] And surely they deserve such a fate. For “the business world” is ruled by an “uncontrollable and disobedient psychology,”[^60] and private investment markets are

> under the influence of purchasers largely ignorant of what they are buying and of speculators who are more concerned with forecasting the next shift of market sentiment than with a reasonable estimate of the future yield of capital assets.[^61]

As a matter of fact, don’t we all know that “there is no clear evidence from experience that the investment policy which is socially advantageous coincides with that which is most profitable;”[^62] indeed, that the decisions of private investors depend largely on “the nerves and hysteria and even the digestions and reactions to the weather,”[^63] rather than on rational calculation?! Thus, concludes Keynes, “the duty of ordering the current volume of investment cannot safely be left in private hands.”[^64] Instead, to turn the present misery into a land of milk and honey, “a somewhat comprehensive socialization of investment will prove the only means.”[^65]

> The State, which is in a position to calculate the marginal efficiency of capital-goods on long views and on the basis of the general social advantage [must take] an ever greater responsibility for directly organizing investment.[^66]

I trust that none of this requires further comment. It is too obvious that these are the outpourings of someone who deserves to be called anything, except an economist.

[^31]: Mises explains:

> Let us assume that there is only gold money and only one central bank. With the successive progress toward the state of an evenly rotating economy all individuals and firms restrict step by step their holding of cash and the quantities of gold thus released flow into nonmonetary—industrial—employment. When the equilibrium of the evenly rotating economy is finally reached, there are no more cash holdings; no more gold is used for monetary purposes. The individuals and firms own claims against the central bank, the maturity of each part of which precisely corresponds to the amount they will need on the respective dates for the settlement of their obligations. The central bank does not need any reserves as the total sum of the daily payments of its customers exactly equals the total sum of withdrawals. All transactions can in fact be effected through transfer in the bank’s books without any recourse to cash. Thus the “money” of this system is not a medium of exchange; it is not money at all; it is merely a *numéraire*, an ethereal and undetermined unit of accounting of that vague and indefinable character which the fancy of some economists and the errors of many laymen mistakenly have attributed to money. (*Human Action*, p. 249)

[^32]: Keynes recognizes that money also has something to do with uncertainty. The fundamental mistake in his theory of money pointed out here, however, surfaces again when he relates money not to uncertainty as such, but, more specifically, to uncertainty of interest rates. “The necessary condition” [for the existence of money] he writes, “is the existence of uncertainty as to the future rate of interest” (*General Theory*, p. 168; also p. 169).

What about the seemingly obvious objection, that the expansion of monetary credit through which Keynes wants to bring about the reduction of the interest rate to zero is nothing but an expansion of paper, and that the problem of scarcity is a matter of “real” goods, which can only be overcome through “genuine savings”? To this he has the following funny answer in *The General Theory*:

> The notion that the creation of credit by the banking system allows investment to take place to which “no genuine saving” corresponds, i.e., the idea that saving and investment … can differ from one another, is to be explained, I think, by an optical illusion. (p. 81)
> 
> [T]he savings which result from this decision are just as genuine as any other savings. No one can be compelled to own the additional money corresponding to the new bank-credit unless he deliberately prefers to hold more money rather than some other form of wealth. (p. 83)
> 
> The new money is not “forced” on anyone. (p. 328)

As Henry Hazlitt remarks,
