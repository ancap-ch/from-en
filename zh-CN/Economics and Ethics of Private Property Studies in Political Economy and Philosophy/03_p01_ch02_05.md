在认识到这一腐败的影响公众舆论，然后，各国越来越多地成为从事再分配政策。 分享政府开支用于文职支出相比，军费开支和纯粹的政府消费的增加。 后者支出仍然可以稳步增加绝对值而言，他们确实这样做实际上无处不在这一天，但他们失去重要性无处不在相对于支出的分配的再分配ist措施。[^41]

根据特定条件的公众意见，这样的redistributionist政策通常同时承担一项两种形式和频繁，因为在该情况下，普鲁士这两个：一方面的形式*Sozialpolitik*，所谓的福利改革，一般涉及一收入的再分配从"富人"的生产者之间的"穷人"，并在另一方面，业务cartelizations和规定， 通常这意味着重新分配从生产"穷人"或"未富人"既定"已备。" 与*Sozialpolitik*呼吁是为了平均主义情绪和相当大的一部分，它可以被破坏，接受国家剥削的在换取该国执行的"社会正义。" 介绍一政策的企业卡特尔化提出了众和条例的一个呼吁保守的感情，特别是中产阶级的建立， 它可以被带到接受国关的非合约的批款，以换取其承诺的保护的现状。 平等主义社会主义和保守主义因此转变成为中央集权的意识形态。 他们相互竞争，在这个意义上，它们主张有所不同模式的重新分配，但是他们的竞争力的努力汇合和整合的联合支持国家主义和中央集权再分配。

第二个结构调整协助在滚回私有财产概念是一个改变在各国的宪法。 在应对挑战的私有财产概念中，国家改变自己的宪法，从君主专制制度或一个贵族的寡头政治的现在熟悉的种类型的所谓自由民主。[^42]，而不是作为一个机构，这限制了进入本身和/或进入特定政府的立场，通过一个系统的种姓或类法律，国家宪法的通过，这在原则上打开所有政府立场的每个人和赠款的平等和普遍权利的参与和竞争中使国家政策。 每个人—不仅仅是"贵族"—现在收到法律股权的状态，并阻于其规则趋于减少。 同时剥削和征用似乎不好，他们似乎少得多，所以，人类正在它是什么，一旦一个人被给予机会参与其过程，并且虽然雄心勃勃的潜在力量掌控者在一般公众以前必须已经沮丧，现在有一个制度化的出口对于它们。

在付出代价的民主化其《宪法》，国家破坏的很大一部分公共舆论进入逐渐忽视的基本事实，即行剥削和没收是在所有的出现和后果相同的，无论如何以及由谁决定和强制执行。 它的诱惑而不是他们接受的看法，即这种行为是合法的，只要作为一个保证说过他们的地方沿线，可以在某种程度上某个地方参与选择国家的人员。[^43]

This corruptive function of democratization as a stimulus for the resurgence of state power has been described with great perceptiveness by Bertrand de Jouvenel:

>第十二至十八世纪的政府权力的增长不断。 该进程的理解，通过所有谁看到它的发生；它搅拌他们进入不断抗议和暴力的反应。 在稍后的时间其增长率继续加快步伐，并将其扩展已带来相应扩展的战争。 现在我们不再是了解这个过程中，我们不再抗议，我们不再作出反应。 在平静的我们是一个新事物，对其权力有要感谢烟幕，在其它有包裹本身。 以前可以看到，体现在人的国王，他并不否认正主他，并在他人的热情是明显的。 现在，藏匿名的，它声称已经不存在了自己，但客观的和激情的器械的大会。 但是，这显然是一个虚构的。 今天一如既往权力手中的一群男人控制的电居。 所有具有改变的是，它现在已经变得容易了裁定，以改变人员的领导掌控者的权力。 从一个角度，这削弱了权力，因为遗嘱，控制社会生活中可能，在社会的荣幸，能代替其他遗嘱，其它感到更有信心。 但是，通过打开的前景力的所有雄心勃勃的人才，这种安排使得扩展的电容易得多。 下*旧制度*、社会运动的精神，曾经为他们所知，没有机会的一个分享权力，迅速谴责其最小的侵占。 现在，另一方面，当每个人都是潜在的部长，没有一个是关于削减一个办公室来其他渴望有一天自己，或来把沙土在一个机的其他手段来使用自己时他又来了。 因此，有的是在政治圈子的一个现代社会的广泛参与扩展的力量。[^44]

其他两个进行的调整状态，以便克服了其最低点的普及和上升到现在的规模必须与距离的关系。 对于一件事情，如前所述和刚才提到的通过再次de Jouvenel，各国要条件垄断性剥削者往往得到参与在州际的战争。 与他们的剥削的内部力量薄弱的愿望，以补偿这些损失通过外部膨胀上升。 但是，这种愿望是沮丧，由于缺乏内部的支持。 支助是通过建立一个政策的再分配、工业条例，并且民主化。 (事实上，国家不采取这些措施注定要失败的任何持久的战争!) 正是这种支持被用来作为一个跳板，用于实现国家的扩张主义欲望。

这种新发现的支持利用事实，即重新分配、监管和民主化意味着一个更大的有形标识的人口数与特定的状态，并从而几乎自动增加导致保护主义，如果不公开的对抗性态度"外人"，特别是国家特权的生产商是通过自然敌对"外国"的竞争。 这种支持是通过转变国家及其知识产权的保镖陷入狂热的民族主义和提供的知识框架，用于融合社会平等，保守的，并且民主主义情绪。[^45]

Backed by such nationalism, states begin on their expansionist course. For more than a century an almost uninterrupted series of wars and imperialist expeditions set in, each one more brutal and destructive than the previous one, with always greater involvement of the noncombative population, culminating in World War I and II but not ending with this. In the name of the socialist, conservative, or democratic nation, and by means of warfare, states have expanded their territories to sizes compared to which even the Roman Empire appears insignificant, and have actually wiped out or brought under foreign rule a steadily increasing number of culturally distinct nations.[^46]

However, not only external expansion of state power is brought about by the ideology of nationalism. War as the natural outgrowth of nationalism is also the means of strengthening the state’s internal powers of exploitation and expropriation. Each war is also an internal emergency situation, and an emergency requires and seems to justify the acceptance of the state’s increasing its control over its own population. Such increased control gained through the creation of emergencies is reduced during peacetime, but it never sinks back to its pre-war levels. Rather, each successfully ended war (and only successful governments can survive) is used by the government and its intellectuals to propagate the idea that it was only because of nationalistic vigilance and expanded governmental powers that the “foreign aggressors” were crushed and one’s own country saved, and that this successful recipe must then be retained in order to be prepared for the next emergency. Led by the just proven “dominant” nationalism, each successful war ends with the attainment of a new peacetime high of governmental controls and thereby further strengthens a government’s appetite for implementing the next winnable international emergency.[^47]

Each new period of peace means a higher level of governmental interference as compared with the previous one: internally in the form of increased restrictions on the range of choices that private property owners are allowed to make regarding their own property; and externally, as regards foreign relations, in the form of higher trade barriers and of increasingly severe restrictions on population movements (most notably on emigration and immigration). Not the least because it is based on increased discrimination against foreigners and foreign trade, any such peace contains the increased risk of the next international conflict, or pressures the affected governments into negotiating bi- or multilateral interstate-agreements aimed at cartelizing their respective power structures and thereby jointly exploiting and expropriating each other’s populations.[^48]

Finally, the fourth adjustment is made necessary by the other three, and again because of the ongoing process of interstate competition, crises, and warfare. It is less of the state’s own making than are redistribution, democratization, and war-making—just as it is not of its own making that there *is* interstate-competition at all. Rather, in fashionable Hayekian terminology, it is the unintended consequence of the fact that short of one state’s domination of the entire world (which is, of course, every state’s dream!) the continued existence of other states keeps exerting a significant constraint on each state’s size and structure.

Whether intended or unintended, this structural adjustment must also be noted if one wishes to fully understand the development that has led to the present world of statism. It is also only by mentioning this adjustment that the question why it is specifically the *tax*-state that has risen to world dominance is finally answered.

It is easy enough to explain how through a series of nationalistic wars during the nineteenth and twentieth century the states of Western Europe and North America could come to dominate the rest of the world and leave their imprint upon it. Notwithstanding the presently booming cultural relativism, the reason for this is the simple fact that these states were the outgrowth of societies with a superior intellectual tradition—that of Western rationalism—with its central ideas of individual freedom and private property, and that this tradition had laid the foundation for the creation of economic wealth far exceeding that existing anywhere else. Because they parasitically drew on such superior economic wealth, it is not at all surprising that these states were then able to battle all others victoriously.

It is also obvious why with the remarkable exception of a number of Pacific countries most of these defeated and reconstituted non-Western states have to this day utterly failed to significantly improve their international stature or even match that of the Western nation states, and have in particular failed to do so after having reached political independence from Western imperialism. With no endogenous tradition of rationalism and liberalism to speak of, such states naturally felt inclined to imitate or adopt the “victorious” ideological imports of socialism, conservatism, democratism, and nationalism, the very ideologies to which these countries’ intellectual elite had been exposed almost exclusively during their studies at the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, London, Paris, Berlin, Harvard, and Columbia. As a matter of course, a brew of such each-and-all statist ideologies, unconstrained by a significant tradition of private property ethic, spells economic disaster, and such a fact more or less rules out any prominent role in international politics.[^49]

Yet what—and it is the answer to this that is somewhat less obvious—if the Western states fight each other? What determines the success in these conflicts, and what is bound to cause defeat?

Naturally, redistribution, democratization, and nationalism cannot be cited again here, for assumedly these states have already adopted such policies in order to regain internal strength and prepare for interstate warfare in the first place. Rather, just as it is the relatively stronger tradition of private property ethic that is responsible for these states’ dominance over the non-Western world, so, *ceteris paribus*, is a relatively more liberal policy responsible for their long run success in the struggle for survival among the Western states themselves. Among them, those states which have adjusted their internal redistributionist policies so as to decrease the importance of a conservatively minded policy of economic regulations relative to that of socialistically inclined policy of taxation tend to outstrip their competitors in the arena of international politics.

Regulations through which states either compel or prohibit certain exchanges between two or more private persons as well as acts of taxation are invasions of private property rights. In pursuing both types of redistributionist policies, the states’ representatives increase their own income at the expense of a corresponding income reduction for someone else. However, while by no means less destructive of productive output than taxation, regulations have the peculiar characteristic of requiring the state’s control over economic resources in order to become enforceable without simultaneously increasing the resources at its disposal. In practice, this is to say that regulations require the state’s command over and expenditure of taxes, yet regulations produce no monetary income for the state but only income in the form of the satisfaction of pure power lust (as when A, for no material gains of his own, outlaws that B and C engage in mutually beneficial trade with each other). On the other hand, taxation and a redistribution of tax revenue according to the principle “from Peter to Paul” increases the economic means at a government’s disposal at least by its own “handling-charge” for the act of redistribution but may produce no other satisfaction (apart from the increased appreciation by the Pauls) than that of actually possessing certain economic resources and being able to expend them according to its own whims.[^50]

Clearly, interstate conflicts and war require economic means, and even more resources the more frequent and longer-lasting such events are. In fact, those states which control more ample economic resources expendable on a war-effort will *ceteris paribus* tend to be victorious. Hence, since a policy of taxation, and taxation without regulation, yields a higher monetary return to the state than a policy of regulation, and of taxation cum regulation, states must willy-nilly move in the direction of a comparatively deregulated economy and a comparatively pure tax-state in order to avoid international defeat.

It is this relative advantage in international politics of the tax-state over the regulatory state that explains the rise of the U.S. to the rank of the world’s foremost imperial power.[^51] It also explains the defeat of such highly regulatory states as Nazi-Germany and Fascist-Italy, the relative weakness of the Soviet Union and its allies as compared to the NATO-alliance, and the recent simultaneous moves toward economic deregulation and increased levels of imperialist aggression of the Reagan and, to a lesser extent, the Thatcher governments.

This concludes my praxeologically informed sociological account of the evolution of the present statist world and the rise, in particular, of the modern tax-state. Based on such an understanding let me end with just a few brief remarks of how it is possible to overcome the tax-state.

It cannot be fought by a simple boycott, as could a private business, because an institution devoted to the business of expropriating and exploiting does not respect the negative verdict revealed by boycotts. It also cannot simply be fought by countering its aggression with defensive violence because the state’s aggression is supported by public opinion. Thus, overcoming it depends on a change in public opinion. The private property ethic—the idea that private property is a just institution and the only means of creating economic prosperity, and the view of the state as an outcast institution that is destructive of wealth formation, must be revived and must again inspire people’s minds and hearts. With the rampant statist ideologies of nationalism, democratism, and redistributionism (of either the socialist or the conservative kind), this may sometimes appear hopeless. However, ideas have changed in the past and can change again in the future. In fact, ideas can change instantaneously.[^52] Moreover, the idea of private property has one decisive attraction: it, and only it, is a true reflection of man’s nature as a rational being.[^53]
