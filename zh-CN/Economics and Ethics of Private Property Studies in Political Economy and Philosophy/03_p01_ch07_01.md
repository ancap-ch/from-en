## 反对信用媒体

几乎所有当代奥地利经济学家都一致反对中央银行模式，并倡导建立自由竞争银行模式。然而，关于什么是“自由竞争银行模式”这个问题，引起了激烈讨论。"自由竞争银行模式"需要百分百保留储蓄银行业务吗？还是可以保留部分准备金？支持部分准备金的“自由银行模式”的两位著名奥地利支持者 George A. Selgin 和 Lawrence White，在其近期发表于“Review of Austrian Economics”中的一篇著作中，系统地进行了尝试，试图回答众多百分百储蓄银行模式的奥地利批评者和保卫者提出的问题。[^1]

针对批评者提出的指控， Selgin 和 White 给出两个论点。首先，他们声称这是部分准备金制度的实践，即信托媒体的问题,不构成欺诈，但以合同自由原则为依据。特别是他们认为部分准备金银行制度与合同的所有权转移理论是一致的，正如 Murray N. Rothbard（以至于 Rothbard 认为部分准备金银行模式是欺诈性的，但他没有坚持这一理论）所研究的那样。其次，他们试图证明，信托媒体的创建并不必然导致经济效率低下和不协调，实际上反而可能有助于防止另一场不可避免的危机，从而改善经济表现。接下来，我们将证明既不存在中心规范性声明也没有建立第二个积极主张。[^2]

### 欺诈问题 I：货币、货币替代品、信托媒体，以及合同的所有权转移理论

为了解决部分准备金银行模式是否构成欺诈这一问题，首先必须澄清一些事实性假设和术语。庆幸的是，辩论双方关于这些问题意见基本一致，因此我们只需简单说明。金钱只能起源于商品，如黄金。因此，金币被定义为“普遍接受的交换媒介”，因而它的特征是“与所有其他资产相比最高的可售性”（例如，它的“占有使人们能够最便捷地进行任何潜在的购买行为”）。[^3] 反过来，货币替代品被定义为对指定数量的货币黄金的索赔或所有权。如果货币替代品(纸币)完全被货币储备（黄金）所代替，Mises 则将它们称为“货币证书”，我们则把他们简单地称为货币替代品。如果货币替代品（纸币）没有被货币（黄金）替代，那么它们将被称为信托媒体。[^4]

基于这些假设和定义，我们现在来看一下信托媒体是否构成欺诈这个问题。所幸的是，这一问题的讨论是由以下事实促成的，即 Selgin 和 White 明确地接受 Rothbardian 的所有权转移理论。信托媒体本质上是欺诈性的，正如 Rothbard 和 Hoppe 声称的。Selgin 和 White 发现：

> 不可能与我们接受的 Rothbard 的合同转让理论进行调和，Rothbard 另外以此来捍卫双方认同的个人自由参与资本主义行为的权利（正当拥有的）。Rothbard 将欺诈定义为“未能履行自愿同意的财产转让”。因此，部分储备安排不可能是*固有的*或*不可避免的*欺诈行为。某一指定银行是否通过持有部分储备进行欺诈必须取决于银行与其客户之间的所有权转让协议条款。[^5]
> 
> 关于银行债务持有部分准备金是否具有欺诈性，并不取决于*本身*是否是需求或时间债务，而是只取决于银行是否歪曲自己持有100％准备金。银行发行的特定索赔的可靠性，即持票人能够随时赎回它，*本身*并不代表银行针对需求总额持有100%的准备金。基于银行的活期存款和票据必然是“仓单”而不是债务这一观点，进行了反驳。我们不明白为什么银行和客户不能在合同上将他们列为债务，而非仓单。我们相信从历史上来看，他们已经这样认同。[^6]

尽管听起来合理，但经不起严格考查。事实上，引文揭示了关于财产和契约的最基本教训被忽略了。正如 Hoppe 明确表达地, “两个人不可能同时拥有同一事物。”[^7] 这是一个不可改变的原则；这是一种任何合同不可更改或废止的自然和行为法则。相反，任何涉及同时将两个不同人作为同一事物所有者（或者同时由多人拥有同一事物）的合同协议在客观上都是虚假的，因此是欺诈性的。[^8] 然而这正是银行和客户之间的部分储备协议所涉及的行为

在发行和接受信托票据时（以必要的折扣价格），无论他们是否信任这场交易，*实际上* 银行和客户都同意将自己同时作为 - 欺诈性地 - 同一对象的所有者。事实上，他们已经签订了合同，针对同一数量的财产同时声明所有权。在发行信托票据时，他们没有，也无法带来更多的财产。事实上，任何合同都不可能增加现有的财产数量，而只能将现有财产(再分配)从一个人转移到另一个人。现有财产只能通过额外拨款和生产来增加(这样一来，增加财产就可以相应地增加所有权的数量)。但部分准备金银行制度和信托媒体的问题，虽然它没有也不能增加现存财产数量，但也不涉及(就像所有其他合同一样)将现有的财产或所有权从一个人转移到另一个人那里。信托票据的问题和对信托票据的接受两者都意味着将财产从银行转移到客户，反之亦然。可以肯定的是，由于信托问题，银行和客户账户中资产和负债的分配被改变了。但是，现有数量的财产实际上并没有从银行转移到客户，反之亦然，因而现有财产总量保持不变。相反，信托媒体代表着对现有未变化的财产的新增的或额外的所有权。它们不是银行或其客户的额外财产供应的结果和记录结果。相反，它们代表额外财产的所有权，但*资产*的供应本身却维持不变。正是从这种意义上来讲，信托媒体完全是凭空造出来的。从财产搜索角度讲，它们是无财产的所有权。这本身就构成了欺诈，无论是根据 Selgin 的定义，即这是一种不愿履行自愿的财产转让，还是根据 Rothbard 和 White 自己的定义，即这是一种为了获得利益而进行的*故意*或*蓄意*的欺骗。信托票据的发行方和购买者(对非货币替代品的货币所有权)，无论他相信什么，本质上和客观上都是为了个人利益而进行了一种虚假陈述。银行及其客户同意将自己歪曲为自己不拥有并且明显不存在的一定数量的财产的所有者;每当他们购买现有数量的财产以此来换取所有权数量不变的财产时，他们总是不可避免地犯有欺诈性占用行为。[^9]

::::Curiously, in the reply to their various critics, Selgin and White selected as their central target an article by Hans-Hermann Hoppe (“How is Fiat Money Possible?—or, The Devolution of Money and Credit”, *Review of Austrian Economics* 7, no. 2 (1994): 49–74, that deals only cursorily with their position. Other Austrian critics of fractional reserve banking explicitly dealt with in Selgin and White’s article including Walter Block, “Fractional Reserve Banking: An Interdisciplinary Perspective”, in *Man, Economy, and Liberty: Essays in Honor of Murray N. Rothbard*, Walter Block and Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., eds. (Auburn, Ala.: Ludwig von Mises Institute, 1988) and Jesús Huerta de Soto, “A Critical Analysis of Central Banks and Fractional-Reserve Free Banking from the Austrian Perspective”, *Review of Austrian Economics* 8, no. 2 (1995): 25–36\. Murray N. Rothbard, the most prominent critic of fractional reserve banking, is targeted only indirectly; and although several of his works are mentioned in their bibliography, Rothbard’s later writings on the subject (“The Myth of Free Banking in Scotland”, *Review of Austrian Economics* 2(1988): 229–57; idem, “Aurophobia: or, Free Banking on What Standard?” *Review of Austrian Economics*, 6, no. 1(1992): 97–108; idem, “The Present State of Austrian Economics”, *Journal des Economistes et des Etudes Humaines* 6, no. 2(1995)) are not mentioned. Likewise ignored entirely are the criticisms by Joseph T. Salerno (“Two Traditions in Modern Monetary Theory: John Law and A.R.J. Turgot”, *Journal des Economistes et des Etudes Humaines* 2, no. 2/3(1991); idem, “The Concept of Coordination in Austrian Macroeconomics”, in *Austrian Economics: Perspectives on the Past and Prospects for the Future*, Richard Ebeling, ed. [Hillsdale, Mich.: Hillsdale College Press, 1991]; and idem, “Mises and Hayek Dehomogenized”, *Review of Austrian Economics* 6, no. 2(1993): 113–46). Selgin and White also do not address, and in this case could not have done so, the most recent and most extensive criticism of their work by Jörg Guido Hülsmann (“Free Banking and the Free Bankers”, *Review of Austrian Economics* 9, no. 1(1996): 3–53).

[^2]: As a doctrinal matter, Selgin and White also suggest that their view of fractional reserve banking coincides with Ludwig von Mises’s view; hence, they call themselves Misesians and claim it is the defenders of 100-percent-reserve banking who are deviationists. This claim can be rejected. In fact, Selgin (*The Theory of Free Banking: Money Supply under Competitive Note Issue* [Totowa, N.J.: Rowman and Littlefield, 1988], pp. 60–63) has frankly acknowledged that Mises’s and his own views concerning fiduciary media are contradictory and White’s attempt to claim Mises as a proponent of fractional reserve free banking has been addressed by Salerno (“Mises and Hayek Dehomogenized”, *Review of Austrian Economics* 6, no. 2(1993): 113–46). Here it suffices to provide a quotation from Mises:

::::> The main thing is that the government should no longer be in a position to increase the quantity of money in circulation and the amount of cheque-book money not fully—i.e., 100 percent—covered by deposits paid in by the public…. No bank must be permitted to expand the total amount of its deposits subject to cheque or the balance of such deposits of any individual customer … otherwise than by receiving cash deposits … or by receiving a cheque payable by another domestic bank subject to the same limitations. This means a rigid 100 per cent reserve for all future deposits; i.e., all deposits not already in existence on the first day of the reform. (*The Theory of Money and Credit* [Irvington-on-Hudson, N.Y.: Foundation for Economic Education, 1978], pp. 438 and 48)

[^4]: See Salerno, “Ludwig von Mises’s Monetary Theory in Light of Modern Monetary Thought”, *Review of Austrian Economics* 8, no. 1 (1994): 71–115\. Selgin and White highlight the fact that Hoppe referred to them as proponents of “partial fiat money”, but then are ultimately compelled to admit that he did in fact not misrepresent their position as advocates of fractional reserve banking based on an underlying gold standard. Their complaint amounts to no more than a dispute over semantics. We will treat it as such here, too, and will concentrate instead exclusively on substantive disagreements.

::::There is actually more to the charge of Selgin and White being fiat money advocates in the article under scrutiny. For, in “the mature free-banking system”, according to Selgin and White (but in contrast to the analysis of the operation of such a system given by Mises), a situation is supposed to emerge in which

::::> At the limit, if inter-clearinghouse settlements were made entirely with other assets (perhaps claims on a super-clearinghouse which itself holds negligible commodity money), and if the public were completely weaned from holding commodity money, the active demand for the old-fashioned money commodity would be wholly nonmonetary. (Lawrence White, *Competition and Currency* [New York: New York University Press, 1989], p. 235)

::::Thus, notes Salerno (“Ludwig von Mises’s Monetary Theory in Light of Modern Monetary Thought”, *Review of Austrian Economics* 8, no. 1(1994): 71–115, p. 76, n. 7) regarding Selgin and White’s ultimate objective, “the public would presumably finally be freed from its shackles of gold to enjoy the virtues of an invisible-hand-generated private fiat money”. Moreover, as far as semantic innovations and deviations from orthodox Misesian terminology, and hence potential sources of confusion are concerned, we have to consider Selgin and White’s own writings. For in referring to money and money substitutes as “outside and “inside” money respectively, in talking of “base money”, “basic money”, “bank money”, “high-powered” and “low-powered” money, and, yes, the gold dollar “as a substitute for bank deposits”, they display an unusual degree of semantic creativity. Moreover, in suggesting, by their selection of terms, that all of these things are somehow equally “money”, their writings actually have become a source of obfuscation. See on this Hülsmann, “Free Banking and the Free Bankers”, pp. 5ff.

[^7]: It is also “impossible that some time depositor and borrower are entitled to exclusive control over the same resources” (Hoppe, “How is Fiat Money Possible?”, p. 67).

[^8]: Even partners cannot simultaneously own the *same* thing. A and B can each own half of a household, or half the shares in it but they each own a *different* 50 percent. It is as logically impossible for them to own the same half as for two people to occupy the same space. Yes, A and B can both be in New York City at the same time, but only in different parts of it.

[^9]: Jesús Huerta de Soto (“A Critical Analysis of Central Banks”, p. 33) correctly likens the effect of fractional reserve banking to that of the so-called tragedy of the commons. Selgin and White (“In Defense of Fiduciary Media”, pp. 92–93, n. 12) object to de Soto’s analogy on the ground that the tragedy of the commons refers “to a particular sort of technological externality”, according to Selgin and White, involves “a physical or otherwise direct interference with someone’s consumption or production” and represents “interaction outside the market”. In contrast, write Selgin and White, the “externality from fiduciary media” is a harmless pecuniary “effect on someone’s wealth transmitted via the price system”, that is, through changes in the system of relative prices, and represents “an interdependence through the market”. Selgin and White err: an object and a title to an object are not the same thing.

::::In lumping money and money substitutes together under the joint title of “money”, as if they were somehow the same thing, Selgin and White fail to grasp that the issue of fiduciary media—an increase of property titles—is not the same thing as a larger supply of property and that relative price changes effected through the issue of fiduciary media are an entirely different “externality” matter than price changes effected through an increase in the supply of property. With this the fundamental distinction between property and a property title in mind, de Soto’s analogy between fractional reserve banking and the tragedy of the commons makes perfect sense. As under the scenario of a tragedy of the commons, every issue of fiduciary media—to titles in search of property—sets in motion a rush, always starting with the bank and its client, to fill these empty tickets with existing property; and in the course of this rush, invariably the first-comers will physically enrich themselves (through the appropriation of existing quantities of property) at the expense of a corresponding impoverishment of later-comers, whose quantity of existing property is physically diminished while they have been left with a larger number of property tickets.
