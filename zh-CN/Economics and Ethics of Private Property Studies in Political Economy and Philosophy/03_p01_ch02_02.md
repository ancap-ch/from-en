如果我们考虑一个过于熟悉的对货币资产征税的案例，要说明这些结论的有效性并不难。这些资产只能被收购和持有，因为他们可以在未来购买其他有价值的资产。他们根本没有内在的使用价值(就像法定货币情况一样)，或者这种使用价值与交换价值相比是微不足道的(就像在金本位制的情况下，货币也有一个小的商品价值)。更确切地说，它们的价值在于它们未来的购买力。然而，如果货币的价值包括代表其他未来可用资产，那么对货币征税的影响就会立即显现出来。最重要的是，随着休闲或消费的边际效用增加，这样的税收增加了未来资产的边际效用，这种激励机制的转变，使参与者在不太耗时的生产过程中更快地获得这些资产。现在通过早期获取资金来间接获得未来资产的系统化程度比通过直接交易获得资产的系统化程度要短。因此，税收意味着易货贸易将越来越多地取代货币兑换的生产方式。但再一次，越来越多地采用易货贸易是对经济原始主义和野蛮行为的回归。 正是因为以易货为目的的生产产生了极低的产出，人类实际上超过了这个发展阶段，而是越来越多地采用并扩大了生产系统 - 用于间接交换的目的,而需要一个较长的等待期,呈现更大的回报更多的和不同资产的卷入金钱关系中。每一个税收行为都意味着在这个过程中被迫后退一步。它减少了产出，减少了劳动分工的范围，并导致社会和经济一体化的减少(它可能被指出，如果不是间接货币兑换制度，它永远不会成为世界性的)。

此外，越来越多地采用直接而非间接交换机制的普遍趋向，由于每次强制性扣押货币都会造成对获得货币本身的方法的极其重要的后果。就像非货币资产一样，货币边际效用和休闲消费边际效用的增加也使得以较少费时的方式获得资金相对更具吸引力。而不是获取它作为回报价值的努力，即在互利交流的框架内，税收鼓励人们更迅速直接地获得税收，而不需要经过繁琐的生产和承包等迂回方法。一方面，这意味着人们会更频繁地通过把钱藏在税务员身上来增加自己的货币资产。 另一方面，越来越多的趋势将通过强制性扣押获得资金 - 或以非法的形式“窃取”，或以合法形式通过参与政治的游戏。[^9]

在完成了对税收影响的总体经济分析之后，现在的经济学教科书作者通常不愿意处理这些问题，现在让我来谈谈他们通常对税收影响下的税收影响的看法。根据我们之前的分析，我们很容易就能发现这类账户的致命缺陷。事实上，如果一个人懒得去研究基础知识，那么他在处理细节问题时就会犯错误，这并不是完全出人意料的事。

关于税收归宿问题的标准说明，最常见的例子是消费税或营业税，如：[ ^10 ]假定征收消费税或营业税。谁必须承担这个责任呢？这是被认可的，当然我也无意质疑这一点的正确性——从某种意义上说，毫无疑问，消费者必须首当其冲，而且总是这样。无论这种税的具体后果是什么,它必须是这样，消费者不得不为同样的商品支付更高的价格，他们的生活水平也因此受损，或税收肯定给生产者带来更高的成本，然后消费者就会因为生产的低产量而受到惩罚。然而,正因如此，我们将不得不极力反对,然后为是否征收税危害消费者前者或后者的方法是一个开放的经验问题争辩,答案取决于征税产品的需求弹性。如果需求缺乏弹性，生产者就会以更高的价格将整个负担转移给消费者。如果是高度弹性的，那么生产者将不得不以更高的生产成本来吸纳税收，并且如果需求曲线的某个部分是无弹性和弹性（据称这是经验上最常见的情况），然后，某种程度上的负担将不得不分担，其中一部分转移到消费者，另一部分转移到生产者。

What is wrong with this sort of argument? While it is couched in terms different from those used in my earlier analysis, one can hardly fail to notice that it merely restates, on a somewhat more specific level of discussion, what has already been demonstrated as false on a more general level: the thesis that taxes may or may not reduce productive output; that there is no necessary connection between taxes and productive output; and that it must be considered empirically possible that a tax may affect consumption exclusively while production remains untouched. To assume, as the textbook-account of taxincidence does, that taxes can be shifted forward, either totally or partially, onto consumers is simply to say that a tax may not negatively affect production. For if it were possible to shift any amount of a tax forward onto consumers, that amount would represent a “nonproduction tax,” a tax exclusively on consumption.[^11]

In order to refute the typical textbook analysis, one could simply go back to our previous discussion that resulted in the conclusion that any tax imposed on people constrained by time preference must negatively affect production above and beyond any negative consequences that it implies for consumption. However, I will choose a somewhat different route of argument here in order to make essentially the same point and thereby establish the more specific thesis that no amount of any tax can be shifted onto consumers. To assume otherwise is to assume something manifestly impossible.

The absurdity of the tax-forward-shifting doctrine becomes clear as soon as one tries to apply it to the case of a single actor who continuously acts in both roles—that of a producer and a consumer. For such a producer-consumer, the doctrine amounts to this proposition: If he is faced with an increase in the costs of attaining some future good—an increase, that is, that he himself perceives as a cost-increasing event—then he shifts these higher costs onto himself in such a way that he responds by attaching a correspondingly higher value to the good to be obtained, thereby restoring his old profit-margin, thus leaving his role as producer unchanged and unimpaired, and requiring restrictive adjustments exclusively in his role as a consumer. Or, formulated even more drastically, insofar as his value-productive efforts are concerned, a tax does not make any difference for an individual, because he just starts liking the to-be-produced good correspondingly more.

Plain reasoning reveals that what generates such absurdity is a fundamental conceptual confusion: The forward-shifting doctrine arises from not recognizing that in one’s analysis one must assume that demand is given—and that this must be assumed because it in fact is given at any point in time. Any analysis that loses track of this is flawed, for if one were to assume that demand had changed, then everything would be possible: production might increase, decrease, or remain unchanged. If I am a producer of tea and tea is taxed and if it is assumed that the demand schedule for tea rises concurrently, then, naturally, it is possible that people are now willing to pay a higher price for tea than previously. Yet this is obviously not a forward shifting of the tax but the result of a change in demand. To present this possibility under the heading of tax-incidence analysis is plain nonsense: it is in fact an analysis of the entirely different question of how prices are affected by changes in demand and has nothing whatsoever to do with the effects of taxation. The confusion here is on as grand a scale as that which one would encounter if someone were to “refute” the statement that one apple and another make two by saying “No, I have just added another apple, and look, there are not two but three apples here.” It is hard to get away with such nonsense in math; in economics a doctrine hardly less absurd is the orthodoxy.

Yet if one is logically committed to assuming demand to be given whenever one tries to answer the question whether or not a tax can be shifted forward, every tax must be interpreted as an event that exclusively affects the supply side: it reduces the supplies at the disposal of suppliers.[^12] Any other conclusion would amount to a denial of what had been assumed from the outset—that a tax had indeed been imposed and perceived as such by producers. To say that only the supply curve is shifted whenever a tax is extracted (while the demand curve remains the same as before) is to say nothing else than that the entire tax-burden must in fact be absorbed by the suppliers. To be sure, the leftward shift of the supply curve would cause prices to rise and consumers would naturally be harmed by having to pay these higher prices and by only being able to afford a smaller amount of goods at such a price.[^13] Yet that consumers will invariably be hurt by taxes has of course never been doubted as one should recall. However, it is a misconception to think that this higher price is a shifting of the tax burden from producers to consumers. Rather, consumers are hurt here “only” by harm being done to producers who, despite higher prices charged for their supplies, must bear the brunt.[^14] One must ask oneself why, if an entrepreneur could indeed shift any amount of the tax-burden away from himself and onto consumers, he would not have already done so by voluntarily imposing a tax on himself instead of waiting for the actual coercive tax to come along! The answer is clear: At all times he is constrained in his price-setting activity by the actual given demand. The price set by any entrepreneur is set with the expectation that a price higher than the one actually chosen would yield a lower total revenue. Otherwise, if he expected a higher price to bring about a larger revenue he would raise it. As long as an entrepreneur expects the demand to be inelastic within the region of any price-range under consideration, he will take advantage of this and choose the higher price. He stops raising prices and settles for a specific one because his expectations are reversed and he anticipates the demand curve above this price to be elastic. These expectations regarding inelastic and elastic portions of the demand curve are not at all changed if the entrepreneur is faced with a tax. Then as now he expects higher prices to produce revenue losses. Thus, it is obviously out of the question to argue that he could escape the burden of the tax. In fact, if as a consequence of the reduced supply the price now rises, this upward movement must be into an elastic portion of the demand curve, and the entrepreneur thus must assumedly pay the full price of it in the form of reduced revenue. Any other conclusion is logically flawed. Only if the entrepreneur expects a change in demand occurring simultaneously with taxation could he change his price without thereby incurring losses. If he expects demand to have increased, for instance, such that there will now be an inelastic rather than an elastic stretch of the demand curve above the presently going price, he will be able to raise it without punishment. Again, this is not a forward shifting of the tax. This is increased demand. With or without the tax the entrepreneur would have acted in precisely the same way. The tax has nothing to do with such price changes. In any case, the tax must be paid exclusively and in full by the suppliers of the taxed goods.[^15]

[^9]: Here once again what has already been explained in a somewhat different connection in note 7 above becomes evident: why it is a fundamental mistake to think that taxation might have a “neutral” effect on production such that any “negative” effects on tax*payers* may be compensated by corresponding “positive” effects on tax *spenders*. What is overlooked in this sort of reasoning is that the introduction of taxation not only implies favoring nonproducers at the expense of producers. It simultaneously changes, for producers and nonproducers alike, the cost attached to different methods of attaining an income, for it is then relatively less costly to attain an additional income through nonproductive means, i.e., not through actually producing more goods but by participating in the process of noncontractual acquisitions of already produced goods. If such a different incentive structure is applied to a given population, then the length of the production structure will necessarily be shortened, and a decrease in the output of goods produced must result.

[^13]: To avoid any misunderstanding then: Insofar as the textbook analyses of tax-incidence point out this fact they are of course entirely correct. It is the interpretation of this phenomenon they give which is fundamentally confused!

[^14]: See on this point also Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*, p. 809.

[^15]: Should a tax not immediately affect supply at all, as can happen in the short run, then it follows from the above analysis that the price charged will not change at all. For to raise it in response to the tax would once again imply pushing it into an elastic region of the demand curve. In the long run the supply will have to be relatively reduced and prices must move into this region. In any case, no forward shifting takes place. See on this also Rothbard, *Man, Economy, and State*, pp. 807ff.; idem, *Power and Market*, pp. 88ff.
