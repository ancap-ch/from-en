It is not difficult to illustrate the validity of these conclusions if one considers the all-too-familiar case of taxing money assets. Such assets are only acquired and held because they can purchase other valuable assets at future dates. They have no own intrinsic use-value at all (as in the case of a fiat paper money), or such use-value is insignificant compared to the exchange-value (as in the case of the gold standard where money also has an—albeit small—commodity value). Rather, the value attached to them is due to their future purchasing power. Yet if the value of money consists of representing other future available assets, the effects of taxing money becomes clear immediately. Most importantly, along with increasing the marginal utility of leisure or consumption, such a tax increases the marginal utility of such future assets. This change in the constellation of incentives translates itself for an actor into increased attempts to obtain these assets more quickly, in less time-consuming production processes. The only production processes now that are systematically shorter than those of attaining future assets indirectly, via the earlier acquisition of money, are those of acquiring them through direct exchanges. Thus, taxation implies that barter trade will be substituted increasingly for the lengthier roundabout production method of monetary exchanges. But once again, resorting increasingly to barter is a regression to economic primitivism and barbarism. It was precisely because production for bartering purposes yielded an extremely low output that mankind actually outgrew this developmental stage and instead increasingly resorted to and expanded a system of production-forindirect-exchange purposes which, while requiring a longer waiting period, renders a far larger return of ever more and different assets drawn into the cash nexus. Every act of taxation means a coerced step backward in this process. It reduces output, decreases the extent of the division of labor, and leads to a reduction in social and economic integration (which, it may be noted, could never have become worldwide, were it not for the institution of indirect monetary exchanges).

Furthermore, the general tendency towards increasingly adopting direct instead of indirect exchange mechanisms caused by every coercive seizure of money also has highly important consequences with regard to the methods of attaining money itself. Just as in the case of non-monetary assets, the increased marginal utility of money along with that of leisure-consumption also makes it relatively more attractive to acquire money in less time-consuming ways. Instead of acquiring it in return for value-productive efforts, i.e., within the framework of mutually beneficial exchanges, taxation raises the incentive to acquire it more quickly and directly, without having to go through such tediously roundabout methods as producing and contracting. On the one hand, this means that one will try more frequently to increase one’s money assets by simply hiding them from the tax collector. On the other hand, a growing tendency will emerge to come into the possession of money through coercive seizure—either in the illegal form called stealing, or legally, by participating in the game called politics.[^9]

Having completed this general economic analysis of the effects of taxation, which today’s economic textbook writers typically prefer not to deal with at all, let me now turn to what they typically do say about the effects of taxation under the heading of tax-incidence. In light of our previous analysis it will be easy to detect the fatal flaw in such accounts. Indeed, that one should fall headlong into error in dealing with specifics if one has not bothered to study the basics can hardly come as a complete surprise.

The standard account of the problem of tax-incidence most frequently exemplified by the case of an excise or sales tax goes like this:[^10] Suppose an excise or sales tax is imposed. Who must bear the burden of this? It is recognized—and I have of course no intention of disputing the validity of this—that in one sense there can be no question that consumers must take the brunt, and invariably do. For no matter what the specific consequences of such a tax are, it must either be the case that consumers will have to pay a higher price for the same goods and their standard of living will be impaired because of this, or it must be the case that the tax imposes higher costs on producers, and consumers will then be punished because of a lower output produced. However, and it is with this that we will have to disagree sharply, it is then argued that whether or not the imposition of a tax harms consumers in the former or in the latter way is an open empirical question, the answer to which depends on the elasticity of demand for the taxed products. If the demand is sufficiently inelastic, then producers will shift the entire burden onto consumers in the form of higher prices. If it is highly elastic, then producers will have to absorb the tax in the form of higher costs of production, and if some section of the demand curve is inelastic and another elastic (this allegedly being empirically the most frequent case), then the burden somehow will have to be shared, with part of it being shifted onto consumers and another falling on producers.

这种争论有什么错? 尽管它与我之前的分析中使用的术语有所不同，但我们很难注意到，它仅仅是在一个更具体的讨论层面上重申，在一个更普遍的层面上已经被证明是错误的:：税收可能会或不会降低生产量的论点；税收和生产量之间没有必然的联系；而且必须从经验上考虑，税收只会在生产保持不变的情况下影响消费。假设，作为税收的教科书，税收可以被完全或部分地转移到消费者身上，仅仅是说税收不会对生产量负面影响。因为如果有可能将任何一项税收转移到消费者身上，那么这一数额将代表一种“非生产税”，一种针对消费的税收。[^ 11]

为了驳斥典型的教科书分析，我们可以简单回顾一下我们之前的讨论，结果得出结论，任何强加于时间偏好的人的税收都必须对生产产生负面影响，而不影响其对消费的负面影响。然而，我会选择一个有些不同的论点，以便基本上达到同样的观点，从而建立一个更具体的论点，即任何税收都不能转移给消费者。否则就假定有什么是不可能的。

一旦试图将这种理论应用于持续兼任生产者和消费者两个角色的单一角色的情况下，税收前移原则的荒谬性就会变得清晰起来。对于这样一个生产者-消费者来说，这一原则就等于这个命题:如果他面临着增加未来产品成本的增加，也就是说，他自己认为这是一种成本增加的事件——然后他转变这些成本较高转移给自己以这样一种方式,：通过附加相应较高的价值来获得所需的利益，从而恢复其旧的利润率，从而使其作为生产者的角色不变且不受损害，并且仅需要对其进行限制性调整作为消费者的角色。或者，更明确地说，在他的价值效益的努力下，税收对个人来说并没有什么不同，因为他开始喜欢的是相对更有价值的东西。

简单推理显示，产生这种荒谬的东西是一种基本的概念上的混淆:向前迁移的理论是由于没有认识到在一个人的分析中必须假设的是，我们必须假设，这是因为它实际上是在任何时间点给出的。任何对这一问题的分析都是有缺陷的，因为如果我们假设需求发生了变化，那么一切都是可能的:生产可能会增加、减少或保持不变。如果我是茶和茶的生产者，如果我认为茶的需求是同时上升的，那么，很自然地，人们现在愿意为茶支付比以前更高的价格。但这显然不是税收的前转移，而是需求变化的结果。在税收分析的标题下提出这种可能性是毫无意义的:它实际上是对价格受需求变化影响的完全不同的问题的分析，与税收的影响没有任何关系。这里的混乱程度是非常大的，如果有人说"反驳"一个苹果和另一个人说"不，我刚刚又加了一个苹果，你看，这里不止两个苹果，而是三个苹果""数学上这种胡言乱语是很难摆脱的;在经济学中，理论几乎不那么荒谬。

然而，如果一个人在逻辑上承诺每当试图回答税收是否可以前移的问题时都会给予要求，那么每个税收都必须被解释为仅影响供应商的事件，它减少了供应商的供应。[^12]任何其他结论都等于否定从一开始就假定的事实 ，生产者也认为确实征收了一项税。如果说只有在提取税款时才改变供应曲线（当需求曲线与之前保持一致），也就是说，整个税收负担实际上必须被供应商吸收。可以肯定的是，供给曲线向左移动会导致价格上涨，消费者自然会因支付这些较高的价格而受到损害，并且只能以这样的价格买得起较少量的商品。[^13]然而，消费者总会受到税收的伤害，当然从来没有人怀疑过应该回想起来。然而，认为这一较高的价格是将税收负担从生产者转移到消费者的想法是一种错误想法。相反，消费者在这里“受到伤害”仅仅是因为生产者受到伤害，尽管他们的供应品收取更高的价格，但他们必须首当其冲。[^14]一个人必须问自己，如果一个企业家真的可以把任何税收负担从他自己身上转移到消费者身上，他就不会主动对自己征税而不是等待实际的强制征税。答案很明确:在任何时候，他都受到实际给定需求的限制。任何企业家所设定的价格都是期望高于实际选择的价格会产生更低的总收入。否则，如果他期望更高的价格带来更大的收入，他就会提高。只要一个企业家预期在任何价格区间内的需求是无弹性的，他就会利用这一点并选择更高的价格。他不再抬高价格，而是选择了一个特定的价格，因为他的预期是相反的，他预计需求曲线会高于这个价格的弹性。如果企业家面临税收，这些关于需求曲线的非弹性部分和弹性部分的预期完全不会改变。 然后像现在一样，他预计更高的价格会产生收入损失。 因此，争辩说他可以摆脱税收的负担显然是不可能的。事实上，如果由于供应减少导致价格上涨，这种向上的趋势必须进入需求曲线的弹性部分，因此企业家必须以收入减少的形式支付其全部价格。 任何其他结论在逻辑上是有缺陷的。 只有当企业家预计需求与税收同时发生变化时，他才能改变价格而不造成损失。例如，如果他预期需求增加了，那么现在就会出现弹性的而不是弹性的需求曲线，超过目前的价格，他将能够在没有惩罚的情况下提高需求曲线。 再次，这不是税收的前移。这是需求增加。 无论有没有税，企业家都会以完全相同的方式行事。 税收与这种价格变化无关。 无论如何，税款必须全部由被征税货物的供应商全额支付。[^ 15]

[^9]: Here once again what has already been explained in a somewhat different connection in note 7 above becomes evident: why it is a fundamental mistake to think that taxation might have a “neutral” effect on production such that any “negative” effects on tax*payers* may be compensated by corresponding “positive” effects on tax *spenders*. What is overlooked in this sort of reasoning is that the introduction of taxation not only implies favoring nonproducers at the expense of producers. It simultaneously changes, for producers and nonproducers alike, the cost attached to different methods of attaining an income, for it is then relatively less costly to attain an additional income through nonproductive means, i.e., not through actually producing more goods but by participating in the process of noncontractual acquisitions of already produced goods. If such a different incentive structure is applied to a given population, then the length of the production structure will necessarily be shortened, and a decrease in the output of goods produced must result.

[^15]: Should a tax not immediately affect supply at all, as can happen in the short run, then it follows from the above analysis that the price charged will not change at all. For to raise it in response to the tax would once again imply pushing it into an elastic region of the demand curve. In the long run the supply will have to be relatively reduced and prices must move into this region. In any case, no forward shifting takes place.
