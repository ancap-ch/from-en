## 经济学与社会学的税收

正如本章标题所示，我为自己设定了两个目标。首先，我想解释税收的一般经济效应。这一章的这一部分代表了对税收的一种行为学分析，因此不应该超出其他经济学家的预期。

第二部分可能会有更多的创意，我将尝试回答这个问题:为什么会有税收?为什么总是有更多的答案?回答这样的问题不是经济理论的任务，而是对社会或历史的解释和重构，从一开始就有更多的思考空间。

说到税收的经济效应并不是什么新鲜事，这并不是说，对许多人来说，这不是什么新闻。事实上，在调查了几本流行的经济学教科书后，我不得不说的是，对当今大多数经济学家和经济学学生来说，我要说的都是新闻。只要这些文本处理税收对经济的影响,超出了纯粹的描述性介绍各种税收政策及其历史发展[^ 1],他们几乎完全沉默的问题一般税收的影响是什么。此外，在他们讨论税收归宿时，这些文本对特定形式的税收的经济影响总是有缺陷的。

然而，这种情况仅仅反映了一个智力退化的过程。早在150年前，关于税收经济学的今天，几乎所有应该被理解的东西都被正确地、令人信服地阐述在经济学的历史上，正如让•巴蒂斯特在《论政治经济学》一书中所说的那样。

与今天的课本编写者不同，他们把对税收的讨论分配到他们书籍的总体架构中，从一开始就正确地定位了“财富的消费”的总体标题下的现象。

然后，他变得毫无差错的将税收作为对财产获取和生产的攻击和惩罚的一种攻击和惩罚，这必然导致在这种财产中所体现的财富的形成和普遍生活水平的降低。

注释说：

> 这是一种明显的荒谬，假设税收有助于国家财富，通过引人注目的国家生产，并通过消费一部分财富来丰富国家。[^2]
> 
> 税收是将一部分国家产品从个人手中转移到政府手中，以满足公共消费或支出的目的。不管它是什么面额的,是否税收,贡献,职责,消费税,关税,援助,补贴,补助金,或免费的礼物,这几乎是一个负担强加给个人,或在一个单独的企业性格,执政的权力,为了提供消费可能认为适当的使他们的代价;简而言之，税，在字面上的意义。[^3]

因为这些基本见解似乎已经被遗忘了,或者至少不再明显地出现在今天,让我,作为我的第一个任务,再次提出了一种对中央论点及其有效性的理论解释和解释，这样做驳斥了一些颇受欢迎的“反驳”，声称税收不需要阻碍财产和财富的形成。根据这一般性的解释，我将在标准教科书分析中论证税收的基本逻辑谬误。

税收-最重要的是-必须被理解为财产和财富形成的一种手段，这是对税收意义的一种简单的逻辑分析。

税收是一个强制性的,非契约性的明确的实物资产转让(现在大部分,但不完全是资金),和价值体现,从一个人或一组人第一次举办这些资产,谁能收入来自进一步控股,到另一个地方,他们现在拥有现在的收入来自这样做。这些资产是如何落到他们原来的所有者手中的?排除这是另一个先前的税收行为的结果，并指出只有那些资产可以被征税，而这些资产尚未被消费，或其价值尚未通过消费行为而耗尽（收税人不会拿走别人的垃圾，而是拿走他的宝贵资产）只有三种可能性存在：他们进入某人的领地，要么是他们认为某些自然赐予的东西是稀缺的并且在任何人看到并完成之前积极地将它们带入了自己的地方。通过用这些先前占用的货物劳动生产它们; 或通过自愿的，从先前的拨款者或生产者的合同获得。只有通过这些类型的活动，才有能力获得和增加价值和可征税资产。原始的拨款行为使以前没有人认为可能的收入来源变成提供收入的资产；生产行为的本质上是把一种不太有价值的资产转化为更有价值的资产；而每一种契约交易都关注特定资产的变更和重定向，从那些对其拥有价值的人手中，而不是那些对其价值更看重的人手中。

由此可见，任何形式的税收都意味着人们可以期望从最初的拨款、生产或承包中获得收入的减少。由于这些活动需要雇用稀少的人——至少是时间和身体的使用——可以用于消费和/或休闲，因此，执行它们的机会成本提高了。边际效用的分配、生产和承包减少，消费和休闲的边际效用增加。 因此，将会有一种倾向，即将原来的角色转移到后者。[^ 4]

Thus, by coercively transferring valuable, not yet consumed assets from their producers (in the wider sense of the term including appropriators and contractors) to people who have not produced them, taxation reduces producers’ present income and their presently possible level of consumption. Moreover, it reduces the present incentive for future production of valuable assets and thereby also lowers future income and the future level of available consumption. Taxation is not just a punishment of consumption without any effect on productive efforts; it is also an assault on production as the only means of providing for and possibly increasing future income and consumption expenditure. By lowering the present value associated with future-directed, value-productive efforts, taxation raises the effective rate of time preference, i.e., the rate of originary interest and, accordingly, leads to a shortening of the period of production and provision and so exerts an inexorable influence of pushing mankind into the direction of an existence of living from hand to mouth. Just increase taxation enough, and you will have mankind reduced to the level of barbaric animal beasts.

Straightforward as such reasoning may seem, there are a number of popular objections raised against it. For instance, from the side of economists who falsely conceive of economics as an empirical science that produces nothing but hypothetical explanations which invariably must be tested against empirical evidence in order to be validated (analogous to the situation in the natural sciences), the following argument is frequently heard: Empirically, it has been observed repeatedly that a rise in the level of taxation was actually accompanied by a rise (not a fall) in GNP or other measures of productive output; hence, the above reasoning, however plausible, must be considered empirically invalid. In fact, some empiricists of this sort go even further and make the stronger claim that taxation actually helps increase the standard of living as evidenced by the fact that some countries with once low standards of living and low levels of taxation now enjoy a much greater wealth with much higher taxes.

Both objections are simply confused. Experience cannot beat logic, and interpretations of observational evidence which are not in line with the laws of logical reasoning are no refutation of these but the sign of a muddled mind (or would one accept someone’s observational report that he had seen a bird that was red and non-red all over at the same time as a refutation of the law of contradiction rather than the pronouncement of an idiot?).

As regards the stronger thesis, it is nothing but a beautiful illustration of the ever so attractive *post hoc ergo propter hoc* fallacy. From the fact that the correlated events of high taxation and wealth were to be observed later than those of low taxation and wealth it is inferred that increased taxation increases wealth. Yet to reason in this way is about as convincing as the argument—justly ridiculed by Say—that one can observe rich men consuming more than poor ones; therefore, their high level of consumption must be responsible for the fact that they are rich.[^5] Just as it follows from the meaning of consumption that this is impossible and that, on the contrary, the rich are not rich because of their high level of consumption but because they previously abstained from consumption and engaged instead in value-productive actions, so it follows from the meaning of taxation that mankind cannot have prospered because of higher levels of taxation but despite such a fact.

The weaker thesis—that experience would at least disprove any claim of a relationship between taxation and productive output that was negative by necessity—is also off the mark. The praxeological reasoning presented above does not at all rule out what empiricist economists falsely interpret as a refutation. In this earlier discussion the conclusion had been reached that the effect of taxation is a relative reduction in the production of valuable assets—a reduction, that is, as compared with the level of output that would have been produced had there been no taxation at all or had the level of taxation not been raised. Nothing was said or implied with respect to the absolute level of the output of valuable assets. As a matter of fact, absolute growth of GNP, for instance, is not only compatible with our earlier praxeological analysis, but can even be seen as a perfectly normal phenomenon to the extent that advances in productivity are possible and actually take place. If it has become possible through improvements in the technology of production to produce a higher output with an identical input (in terms of cost), or a physically identical output with a reduced input, then the coincidence of increased taxation and an increased output of valuable assets is anything but surprising. However, this does not in the least affect the validity of what has been stated about relative impoverishment resulting from taxation. With a given state of technological knowledge, though it may change over time, and taxation being what it is (a punishment of value-productive efforts), the level of productive output must be lower than the one that could have been attained with the same knowledge and no or lower taxation. Statistical studies here are entirely beside the point: they can neither help strengthen it, nor can they ever be used to weaken it.

Another theoretical objection which enjoys some popularity is that imposing or raising taxes leads to a reduction of income derived from the assets taxed; that this reduction raises the marginal utility of such assets as compared to what can be derived from other forms of activity; and thus, instead of lowering it, taxation actually helps increase the tendency to engage in production. For the usual case of taxing money assets this is to say that taxes reduce monetary income which raises the marginal utility of money, and this in turn increases the incentive to attain monetary returns. This argument, to be sure, is perfectly true as far as it goes. However, it is a misconception to believe that it does anything to invalidate the relative impoverishment thesis that I have advanced. First of all, in order to keep the record straight it should be noted that even if it were true—as the just presented argument seems to suggest, albeit falsely as we will see—that increased taxation does not lead to a relatively lower output of valuable assets produced since it spurs a proportional increase in workaholism, it is still the case that the income of value-productive individuals has fallen. Even if they produce the same output as previously, they can only do so if they expend more labor now than before. Since any additional labor expenditure implies forgone leisure or consumption (leisure or consumption which they otherwise could have enjoyed along with the same output of valuable assets), their overall standard of living must be lower.[^6]

It now becomes apparent why the assumption that taxation can leave the productive output of valuable assets unaffected and exclusively cripple consumption is fatally flawed. If taxation reduces one’s income (which includes that derived from present consumption and leisure), and given the universal fact of time preference, that is, that human actors invariably prefer present goods over future goods (that they cannot do without continuous consumption and can engage in lengthier, more roundabout methods of production only if a provision in the form of consumption goods has been made for the corresponding waiting period), then it necessarily follows that a person’s effective rate of time preference must have been raised through this very act (the disutility of waiting must have increased), and that he will have to shorten the length of the structure of production as compared to the one that he otherwise would have chosen. Accordingly, his output of valuable assets available at future dates will have to be lower than would be the case otherwise. If with lower or no taxation his income had been higher and his time preference schedule being given (whatever it happens to be at any particular point in time), he would have invested in lengthier production processes. As a consequence, his output of valuable future assets would have been relatively greater.[^7]

The error in the thesis that taxation can have a neutral effect on production lies in the fact that time preference is not taken into account. The argument presently under scrutiny is quite correct in pointing out that taxation implies a twofold signal: on the one hand the substitution effect working in favor of consumption and leisure and against work; and on the other hand the income effect of raising the marginal utility of the taxed asset. However, it is false to interpret this simplistically as a mixed bag of contradictory signals—one in favor of and one against work—so that one can then state nothing of a categorical nature regarding the effects of taxation on production, and the question of whether or not taxation provides for a lower or a higher output of valuable assets must be conceived of as an entirely empirical one.[^8] For in fact, the signal of taxation is not contradictory at all once it has been recognized that it is being sent to persons whose actions are invariably constrained by time preference. For such actors there exists not only the alternative between work and no work at all but also one between producing a valuable asset in more or less time-consuming ways. Invariably, they must also choose between obtaining an asset quickly and directly, with little waiting time involved, but at the price of having to resort to less efficient methods of production (the famous fisherman who decides to use his bare hands to catch fish in order to obtain it more quickly than by going through more roundabout methods of production), or obtaining it through more productive methods but then having to wait longer for them to bear fruit (the fisherman who, lured by higher future returns, decides to endure a longer waiting period and first builds a net). However, given these choices, the message of taxation is completely unambiguous and unequivocal, and there can no longer be any question that the substitution effect must be thought of as systematically dominating any income effect: If there is not only the option of having something or not having it but also of having less of something sooner or more of it later, the double message sent through taxation is easily integrated and translated into one: reduce the waiting time; shorten the roundabout methods of production! By doing so, valuable assets will be obtained earlier—in line with their increased marginal utility. Simultaneously, in shortening the waiting period, more room will be given for leisure—in line with its increased marginal utility. By reducing the length of roundabout methods of production the two seemingly contradictory signals stemming from taxation are simultaneously accounted for. Contrary to any claim of a systematically “neutral” effect of taxation on production, the consequence of any such shortening of roundabout methods of production is a lower output produced. The price that invariably must be paid for taxation, and for every increase in taxation, is a coercively lowered productivity that in turn reduces the standard of living in terms of valuable assets provided for future consumption. Every act of taxation necessarily exerts a push away from more highly capitalized, more productive production processes in the direction of a hand-to-mouth-existence.

[^7]: One might object here that the tax receipts will come into someone’s hands—those of government officials or of governmental transfer-paymentrecipients—and that their increased income, resulting in a lower effective time preference rate for them, may offset the increase in this rate on the taxpayers’ side and hence leave the overall rate and the structure of production unchanged. Such reasoning, however, is categorically flawed: For one thing, insofar as government expenditure is concerned, it cannot be regarded as investment at all. Rather, it is consumption, and consumption alone. For, as Rothbard has explained,

::::> [i]n any sort of division-of-labor economy, capital goods are built, not for their own sake by the investor, but in order to use them to produce lower-order and eventually consumers’ goods. In short, a characteristic of an investment expenditure is that the good in question is not being used to fulfill the needs of the investor, but of someone else—the consumer. Yet, when government confiscates resources from the private market economy, it is precisely defying the wishes of the consumers; when government invests in any good, it does so to serve the whims of government officials, not the desires of consumers. (*Man, Economy, and State*, pp. 816–17)

::::Thus, government expenditure, by definition, cannot be conceived of as lengthening the production structure and hence as counterbalancing the taxpayers’ raised time preference rate.—On the other hand,

::::> as for the *transfer* expenditures made by the government (including the salaries of bureaucrats and subsidies to privileged groups), it is true that some of this will be saved and invested. These investments, however, will not represent the voluntary desires of consumers, but rather investments in fields of production *not* desired by the *producing* consumers…. Once let the tax be eliminated, and … the new investments called forth by the demands of the specially privileged will turn out to be *malinvestments*. (*Power and Market*, p. 98)

::::Consequently, transfer expenditures also cannot be conceived of as compensating for the fact that taxpayers shorten the length of the production structure. All such expenditures can do is to lengthen the structure of mal-production. “At any rate” concludes Rothbard,

::::> the amount consumed by the government insures that the effect of income taxation will be to raise time-preference ratios and to reduce saving and investment. (Ibid., p. 98)
