## The Economics and Sociology of Taxation

As the title of the chapter indicates, I have set myself two goals. First, I want to explain the general economic effect of taxation. This part of the chapter represents a praxeological analysis of taxation and as such should not be expected to go much beyond what has already been said by other economists.

More originality might be found in the second part, where I will try to answer the question: why is there taxation; and why is there always more of it? Answering such questions is not the task of economic theory but of praxeologically informed and constrained sociological or historical interpretations and reconstructions, and from the very outset much more room for speculation in this field of intellectual inquiry exists.

To say there is nothing new to be stated regarding the economic effects of taxation is not to say that what there *is* would not be news to many. In fact, after surveying several popular economics textbooks it would seem that what I have to say is news to most of today’s economists and students of economics. Insofar as these texts deal with the economic effects of taxation at all, beyond a purely descriptive presentation of various tax-schemes and their historical development[^1], they are almost completely silent on the question of what the general effects of taxation are. Moreover, what in their discussion of the problem of tax-incidence these texts then say about the economic effects of specific forms of taxation is invariably flawed.

However, this state of affairs merely reflects a process of intellectual degeneration. As early as 150 years ago almost everything that should be understood today about the economics of taxation had been correctly and convincingly stated by such a prominent figure in the history of economics as Jean Baptiste Say in his *Treatise on Political Economy*.

In contrast to today’s textbook writers, who assign the discussion of taxation to arbitrary places within the overall architectonic of their books, from the beginning Say correctly locates the phenomenon under the general heading “Of the Consumption of Wealth.”

He then unmistakenly identifies and explains taxation as an attack on and punishment of the acquisition and production of property, which necessarily leads to a reduction in the formation of wealth embodied in such property and to a lowering of the general standard of living.

Notes Say:

> It is a glaring absurdity to pretend, that taxation contributes to national wealth, by engrossing part of the national produce, and enriches the nation by consuming part of its wealth.[^2]
> 
> Taxation is the transfer of a portion of the national products from the hands of individuals to those of the government, for the purpose of meeting public consumption or expenditure. Whatever be the denomination it bears, whether tax, contribution, duty, excise, custom, aid, subsidy, grant, or free gift, it is virtually a burden imposed upon individuals, either in a separate or corporate character, by the ruling power for the time being, for the purpose of supplying the consumption it may think proper to make at their expense; in short, an impost, in the literal sense.[^3]

Since such fundamental insights seem to have been forgotten, or at least no longer appear obvious today, let me, as my first task, present anew a praxeological account and explanation for Say’s central argument and its validity, and in so doing refute some popular “counterarguments” claiming to show that taxation need not obstruct the formation of property and wealth. In light of this general explanation, I will then demonstrate the fundamental logical fallacy in the standard textbook analysis of tax-incidence.

That taxation—foremost and above all—is and must be understood as a means for the destruction of property and wealth-formation follows from a simple logical analysis of the meaning of taxation.

Taxation is a coercive, non-contractual transfer of definite physical assets (nowadays mostly, but not exclusively money), and the value embodied in them, from a person or group of persons who first held these assets and who could have derived an income from further holding them, to another, who now possesses them and now derives an income from so doing. How did these assets come into the hands of their original owners? Ruling out that this was the outcome of another previous act of taxation, and noting that only those assets can be taxed that have not yet been consumed or whose value has not yet been exhausted through acts of consumption (a tax-gatherer does not take away another man’s garbage but rather his still valuable assets!), three and only three possibilities exist: They come into one’s possession either by one’s having perceived certain nature-given goods as scarce and having actively brought them into one’s possession before anyone else had seen and done so; by having produced them by means of one’s labor out of such previously appropriated goods; or through voluntary, contractual acquisition from a previous appropriator or producer. Only through these types of activities is one capable of acquiring and increasing valuable—and hence taxable—assets. Acts of original appropriation turn something which no one had previously perceived as a possible source of income into an income-providing asset; acts of production are by their very nature aimed at the transformation of a less valuable asset into a more valuable one; and every contractual exchange concerns the change and redirection of specific assets from the hands of those who value their possession less to those who value them more.

From this it follows that any form of taxation implies a reduction of income a person can expect to receive from original appropriation, from production, or from contracting. Since these activities require the employment of scarce means—at least time and the use of one’s body—which could be used for consumption and/or leisure, the opportunity cost of performing them is raised. The marginal utility of appropriating, producing, and contracting is decreased, and the marginal utility of consumption and leisure increased. Accordingly, there will be a tendency to shift out of the former roles and into the latter ones.[^4]

因此，通过强制转移有价值的、尚未消费的资产(从更广泛的意义上说，包括拨款者和承包商)到没有生产这些资产的人，税收降低了生产者目前的收入和他们目前可能的消费水平。此外，它减少了现有激励未来的生产有价值的资产，从而也降低了未来的收入和可消费的未来水平。征税不仅是对消费的惩罚，对生产力没有任何影响;这也是对生产的一种攻击，因为它是提供和可能增加未来收入和消费支出的唯一手段。通过降低与未来定向的价值生产力相关的现值，税收提高了时间偏好的有效率，即原始利率，并导致生产和提供的时间缩短，从而产生 把人类推向一个人的生存方向的不可阻挡的影响。只要增加足够的税收，你就会把人类降低到野蛮野兽的水平。

尽管这样的推理看似简单，但仍有许多人反对它。例如，从经济学家的角度来看，他们错误地认为经济学是一门经验科学，它只会产生假设的解释，而解释总是必须与经验证据进行对比来验证（类似于自然科学的情况），但下面的论证 经常被听到：实际上，人们一再指出，税收水平上升实际上伴随着国民生产总值或其他生产性产出指标的上升（而不是下降）因此，上述推理，无论多么可信，都必须被视为经验无效的。事实上，一些这样的经验主义者甚至进一步提出强有力的主张，即税收实际上有助于提高生活水平，事实证明，一些生活水平低和税收水平低的国家现在享有更大的财富税率高得多。

这两种反对都是简单而困惑。经验无法打败逻辑和解释的观测证据不符合法律逻辑推理没有驳斥这些但头脑混乱的标志(或将接受某人的观察报告,他看到了一只鸟,是红色和非红色的同时驳斥的矛盾而不是白痴的声明吗?)。

关于更有力的论点，这只不过是一个非常有吸引力的事后特别报告的美丽例证。从高税收和高财富的相关事件比低税收和财富更晚被观察到的事实，可以推断增加税收会增加财富。然而，以这种方式推理，就像人们所说的那样令人信服——那就是，人们可以观察到富人比穷人消费得多;因此，他们的高消费水平必须对他们富有的事实负责。[^5] 正如消费的含义可以看出,这是不可能的,相反,富人并不富裕,因为他们的高水平的消费,而是因为他们从消费之前投了弃权票,而不是从事价值生产行动,因此从这个意义上说，人类不可能有税收的成功是由于较高水平税收尽管这样一个事实。

较弱的论点 - 这一经验至少会驳斥任何关于税收和生产性产出之间关系的说法 - 这种说法在必然性上是否定的。上述的理论推理并不完全排除经验主义经济学家的错误解释。在之前的讨论中已经达成结论的影响税收是一个相对减少的生产有价值的工具——减少,也就是说,与产出水平相比是没有税收,或者已经产生的税收水平没有提高。对于有价值资产的绝对产出水平没有任何说法或暗示。事实上，例如，国民生产总值的绝对增长不仅与我们先前的行为分析相一致，而且甚至可以视为一种完全正常的现象，因为生产率的提高是可能的并且实际发生。如果可以通过改进生产技术来生产更高产出的产品（成本方面），或者物理上相同的产出并减少输入，那么税收增加和有价值产出增加的巧合资产是令人惊讶的。然而，这丝毫没有影响到有关因征税而导致的相对贫困问题的有效性。有了一定的技术知识，尽管它可能会随着时间的推移而发生变化，而税收是(价值生产力的惩罚)，生产量水平必须低于同一知识和不能更低的税收所能达到的水平。这里的统计研究完全无关紧要:它们既不能帮助加强它，也不能用来削弱它。

另一种受欢迎的理论反对意见是，征税或增税会导致从征税的资产中减少收入;与其他形式的活动相比，这种减少增加了这些资产的边际效用;因此，税收非但没有降低税收，反而有助于增加生产的倾向。对于货币资产征税通常的情况，这是说，税收降低了货币收入，提高了货币的边际效用，这反过来又增加了获得货币回报的激励。可以肯定的是，这个论点在其发展过程中是完全正确的。然而，认为它对我所提出的相对贫困的论点无效是一种误解。首先，为了保持记录的正确性，应该注意的是，即使它是正确的 - 就像刚才提出的论点似乎表明的那样，虽然我们将会看到这是错误的，但增加税收并不会导致相对较低的产出，由于它促使工作狂的比例增加，所以产生了有价值的资产，但具有价值生产力的个人收入仍然下降。即使他们生产量和以前一样，他们也只能这样做，如果他们现在比以前消耗更多的劳动力。因为任何额外劳动力支出意味着放弃休闲或消费(休闲或消费，否则他们本来可以享受相同的输出有价值的资产),整体的生活水平必须要低。[^ 6]

It now becomes apparent why the assumption that taxation can leave the productive output of valuable assets unaffected and exclusively cripple consumption is fatally flawed. If taxation reduces one’s income (which includes that derived from present consumption and leisure), and given the universal fact of time preference, that is, that human actors invariably prefer present goods over future goods (that they cannot do without continuous consumption and can engage in lengthier, more roundabout methods of production only if a provision in the form of consumption goods has been made for the corresponding waiting period), then it necessarily follows that a person’s effective rate of time preference must have been raised through this very act (the disutility of waiting must have increased), and that he will have to shorten the length of the structure of production as compared to the one that he otherwise would have chosen. Accordingly, his output of valuable assets available at future dates will have to be lower than would be the case otherwise. If with lower or no taxation his income had been higher and his time preference schedule being given (whatever it happens to be at any particular point in time), he would have invested in lengthier production processes. As a consequence, his output of valuable future assets would have been relatively greater.[^7]

The error in the thesis that taxation can have a neutral effect on production lies in the fact that time preference is not taken into account. The argument presently under scrutiny is quite correct in pointing out that taxation implies a twofold signal: on the one hand the substitution effect working in favor of consumption and leisure and against work; and on the other hand the income effect of raising the marginal utility of the taxed asset. However, it is false to interpret this simplistically as a mixed bag of contradictory signals—one in favor of and one against work—so that one can then state nothing of a categorical nature regarding the effects of taxation on production, and the question of whether or not taxation provides for a lower or a higher output of valuable assets must be conceived of as an entirely empirical one.[^8] For in fact, the signal of taxation is not contradictory at all once it has been recognized that it is being sent to persons whose actions are invariably constrained by time preference. For such actors there exists not only the alternative between work and no work at all but also one between producing a valuable asset in more or less time-consuming ways. Invariably, they must also choose between obtaining an asset quickly and directly, with little waiting time involved, but at the price of having to resort to less efficient methods of production (the famous fisherman who decides to use his bare hands to catch fish in order to obtain it more quickly than by going through more roundabout methods of production), or obtaining it through more productive methods but then having to wait longer for them to bear fruit (the fisherman who, lured by higher future returns, decides to endure a longer waiting period and first builds a net). However, given these choices, the message of taxation is completely unambiguous and unequivocal, and there can no longer be any question that the substitution effect must be thought of as systematically dominating any income effect: If there is not only the option of having something or not having it but also of having less of something sooner or more of it later, the double message sent through taxation is easily integrated and translated into one: reduce the waiting time; shorten the roundabout methods of production! By doing so, valuable assets will be obtained earlier—in line with their increased marginal utility. Simultaneously, in shortening the waiting period, more room will be given for leisure—in line with its increased marginal utility. By reducing the length of roundabout methods of production the two seemingly contradictory signals stemming from taxation are simultaneously accounted for. Contrary to any claim of a systematically “neutral” effect of taxation on production, the consequence of any such shortening of roundabout methods of production is a lower output produced. The price that invariably must be paid for taxation, and for every increase in taxation, is a coercively lowered productivity that in turn reduces the standard of living in terms of valuable assets provided for future consumption. Every act of taxation necessarily exerts a push away from more highly capitalized, more productive production processes in the direction of a hand-to-mouth-existence.

[^7]: One might object here that the tax receipts will come into someone’s hands—those of government officials or of governmental transfer-paymentrecipients—and that their increased income, resulting in a lower effective time preference rate for them, may offset the increase in this rate on the taxpayers’ side and hence leave the overall rate and the structure of production unchanged. Such reasoning, however, is categorically flawed: For one thing, insofar as government expenditure is concerned, it cannot be regarded as investment at all. Rather, it is consumption, and consumption alone. For, as Rothbard has explained,

> [i]n any sort of division-of-labor economy, capital goods are built, not for their own sake by the investor, but in order to use them to produce lower-order and eventually consumers’ goods. In short, a characteristic of an investment expenditure is that the good in question is not being used to fulfill the needs of the investor, but of someone else—the consumer. Yet, when government confiscates resources from the private market economy, it is precisely defying the wishes of the consumers; when government invests in any good, it does so to serve the whims of government officials, not the desires of consumers. (*Man, Economy, and State*, pp. 816–17)

Thus, government expenditure, by definition, cannot be conceived of as lengthening the production structure and hence as counterbalancing the taxpayers’ raised time preference rate.—On the other hand,

> as for the *transfer* expenditures made by the government (including the salaries of bureaucrats and subsidies to privileged groups), it is true that some of this will be saved and invested. These investments, however, will not represent the voluntary desires of consumers, but rather investments in fields of production *not* desired by the *producing* consumers…. Once let the tax be eliminated, and … the new investments called forth by the demands of the specially privileged will turn out to be *malinvestments*. (*Power and Market*, p. 98)

Consequently, transfer expenditures also cannot be conceived of as compensating for the fact that taxpayers shorten the length of the production structure. All such expenditures can do is to lengthen the structure of mal-production. “At any rate” concludes Rothbard,

> the amount consumed by the government insures that the effect of income taxation will be to raise time-preference ratios and to reduce saving and investment. (Ibid., p. 98)
