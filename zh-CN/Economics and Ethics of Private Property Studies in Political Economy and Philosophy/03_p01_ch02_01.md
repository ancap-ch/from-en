## 税收的经济学和社会学

正如这一章的标题所指出的，我给自己设定了两个目标。首先，我想解释一下税收的普遍经济效应。本章的这一部分代表的是对税收的行为学分析, 因此不应期望它远远超出其他经济学家已经说过的内容。

在第二部分中可能会出现更多的原创性，在这一章我会试着回答这个问题：为什么会有税收；为什么总有更多的税收？回答这样的问题不是经济学理论的任务，而是从社会学或历史学的角度来解释和约束社会学或历史的解释和重构，从一开始在这个知识探究领域就存在更多的猜测空间。

###

假如说没有什么新的东西能够证明税收对经济的影响，那并不是说，对许多人来说这并不是什么新闻。事实上，在调查了几本流行的经济学教科书之后，我想说的是，今天的大多数经济学家和经济学家都是新闻。这些文章在处理税收的经济影响的时候，除了纯粹的描述各种税收方案及其历史发展之外[^1]，对于税收的普遍影响，他们几乎是完全沉默的。此外, 在讨论有关税务的问题时, 这些文章在说关于具体税收形式的经济影响时又难免有瑕疵。

然而，这种情况仅仅反映了知识退化的过程。早在150年前，现在理解的几乎所有关于税收经济学的知识，在经济学的历史中，Jean Baptist这一杰出人物就已经在他的文章*政治经济学论文*中正确和令人信服地阐述了这一理论。

与今天的教科书作者不同，他们讲关于税收的讨论分配在书中随意的位置，从一开始就正确定位了"财富消费"这样一个普遍标题下的现象。

随后，他又将税收作为对财产购置和生产的一种攻击和惩罚，并将其解释为对财产征收和生产的一种打击，这必然导致财富的形成，并降低一般的生活水平。

注释：

> 这是一种显而易见的荒谬之处，即税收是国家财富的一部分，是国民生产的一部分，并通过消费部分财富使国家富足。[^2]
> 
> 税收是将一部分国家产品从个人手中转移到政府手中，目的是为了达到公共消费或支出的目的。它所承受的面值，是否征税，贡献，关税，消费税，自定义，援助，补贴，赠予或免费赠与，无论是在一个单独的或企业的角色上，它实际上是一种强加于个人的负担，还是由当时的统治力所强加的。目的是为消费提供必要的费用；简而言之，就是字面意义上的关税。[^3]

因为这样的基本观点似乎已经被遗忘了，或者至少在今天看来已经不那么明显了，作为我的第一个任务，让我重新提出一个关于Say’s中心论点及其有效性的行为学研究和解释，并以此反驳一些流行的声称税收不必阻碍财产和财富的形成“反对论点”。根据这一一般性的解释，我将在标准的教科书分析中论证税务发生率的基本逻辑谬误。

税收—最重要的是—必须理解为破坏财产和财富形成的手段，这是通过对税收的含义进行简单的逻辑分析得出的。

征税是一种强制性的、非合同性的有形资产转让 (现在主要是, 但不是完全是金钱), 以及它们所体现的价值, 从最先持有这些资产以及可以获得进一步通过持有资金获得收入这一个人或者一组人手中，转移到另一些现在持有他们并且从中获得收入的人手中。这些资产是如何落入原始拥有者手中的呢？排除这是另一项以前的征税行为的结果，并且注意到只有那些尚未被消费, 或其价值还没有通过消费行为耗尽的资产才能被征税（一个收税员并没有拿走不是另一个人的垃圾而是他仍然有价值的资产），那么就有且仅有三种可能性存在：他们占有另一个人的资产，要么是认为某些自然物品是稀缺的，并且在其他人看到和这样做之前迅速地把它们纳入为自己的财产；通过从先前批出的货物的劳动中生产得到的；或通过自愿, 合同收购从以前的占有者或生产者手中得到。只有通过这些类型的活动, 才能获得和增加宝贵的—应当纳税的—资产。原始拨款的行为将以前没有人认为可能的收入来源转变成为一种有收入来源的资产；生产行为本质上是为了将一种价值较低的资产转化为更有价值的资产；每一种契约交换都涉及到对特定资产的变更和重定向，从那些对其拥有较少价值的人手中，而不是那些对他们更有价值的人。

由此可见，任何形式的税收都意味着一个人可以从最初的拨款、生产或者合同中获得的收入减少。由于这些活动需要雇用可用于消费和/或休闲的—至少是需要时间或者使用身体—稀缺手段，因此提高了执行这些措施的机会成本。挪用、生产、承包边际效用降低, 消费休闲边际效用增加。因此, 从前一个角色转变为后者将成为一种趋势。

Thus, by coercively transferring valuable, not yet consumed assets from their producers (in the wider sense of the term including appropriators and contractors) to people who have not produced them, taxation reduces producers’ present income and their presently possible level of consumption. Moreover, it reduces the present incentive for future production of valuable assets and thereby also lowers future income and the future level of available consumption. Taxation is not just a punishment of consumption without any effect on productive efforts; it is also an assault on production as the only means of providing for and possibly increasing future income and consumption expenditure. By lowering the present value associated with future-directed, value-productive efforts, taxation raises the effective rate of time preference, i.e., the rate of originary interest and, accordingly, leads to a shortening of the period of production and provision and so exerts an inexorable influence of pushing mankind into the direction of an existence of living from hand to mouth. Just increase taxation enough, and you will have mankind reduced to the level of barbaric animal beasts.

Straightforward as such reasoning may seem, there are a number of popular objections raised against it. For instance, from the side of economists who falsely conceive of economics as an empirical science that produces nothing but hypothetical explanations which invariably must be tested against empirical evidence in order to be validated (analogous to the situation in the natural sciences), the following argument is frequently heard: Empirically, it has been observed repeatedly that a rise in the level of taxation was actually accompanied by a rise (not a fall) in GNP or other measures of productive output; hence, the above reasoning, however plausible, must be considered empirically invalid. In fact, some empiricists of this sort go even further and make the stronger claim that taxation actually helps increase the standard of living as evidenced by the fact that some countries with once low standards of living and low levels of taxation now enjoy a much greater wealth with much higher taxes.

Both objections are simply confused. Experience cannot beat logic, and interpretations of observational evidence which are not in line with the laws of logical reasoning are no refutation of these but the sign of a muddled mind (or would one accept someone’s observational report that he had seen a bird that was red and non-red all over at the same time as a refutation of the law of contradiction rather than the pronouncement of an idiot?).

As regards the stronger thesis, it is nothing but a beautiful illustration of the ever so attractive *post hoc ergo propter hoc* fallacy. From the fact that the correlated events of high taxation and wealth were to be observed later than those of low taxation and wealth it is inferred that increased taxation increases wealth. Yet to reason in this way is about as convincing as the argument—justly ridiculed by Say—that one can observe rich men consuming more than poor ones; therefore, their high level of consumption must be responsible for the fact that they are rich.[^5] Just as it follows from the meaning of consumption that this is impossible and that, on the contrary, the rich are not rich because of their high level of consumption but because they previously abstained from consumption and engaged instead in value-productive actions, so it follows from the meaning of taxation that mankind cannot have prospered because of higher levels of taxation but despite such a fact.

The weaker thesis—that experience would at least disprove any claim of a relationship between taxation and productive output that was negative by necessity—is also off the mark. The praxeological reasoning presented above does not at all rule out what empiricist economists falsely interpret as a refutation. In this earlier discussion the conclusion had been reached that the effect of taxation is a relative reduction in the production of valuable assets—a reduction, that is, as compared with the level of output that would have been produced had there been no taxation at all or had the level of taxation not been raised. Nothing was said or implied with respect to the absolute level of the output of valuable assets. As a matter of fact, absolute growth of GNP, for instance, is not only compatible with our earlier praxeological analysis, but can even be seen as a perfectly normal phenomenon to the extent that advances in productivity are possible and actually take place. If it has become possible through improvements in the technology of production to produce a higher output with an identical input (in terms of cost), or a physically identical output with a reduced input, then the coincidence of increased taxation and an increased output of valuable assets is anything but surprising. However, this does not in the least affect the validity of what has been stated about relative impoverishment resulting from taxation. With a given state of technological knowledge, though it may change over time, and taxation being what it is (a punishment of value-productive efforts), the level of productive output must be lower than the one that could have been attained with the same knowledge and no or lower taxation. Statistical studies here are entirely beside the point: they can neither help strengthen it, nor can they ever be used to weaken it.

Another theoretical objection which enjoys some popularity is that imposing or raising taxes leads to a reduction of income derived from the assets taxed; that this reduction raises the marginal utility of such assets as compared to what can be derived from other forms of activity; and thus, instead of lowering it, taxation actually helps increase the tendency to engage in production. For the usual case of taxing money assets this is to say that taxes reduce monetary income which raises the marginal utility of money, and this in turn increases the incentive to attain monetary returns. This argument, to be sure, is perfectly true as far as it goes. However, it is a misconception to believe that it does anything to invalidate the relative impoverishment thesis that I have advanced. First of all, in order to keep the record straight it should be noted that even if it were true—as the just presented argument seems to suggest, albeit falsely as we will see—that increased taxation does not lead to a relatively lower output of valuable assets produced since it spurs a proportional increase in workaholism, it is still the case that the income of value-productive individuals has fallen. Even if they produce the same output as previously, they can only do so if they expend more labor now than before. Since any additional labor expenditure implies forgone leisure or consumption (leisure or consumption which they otherwise could have enjoyed along with the same output of valuable assets), their overall standard of living must be lower.[^6]

It now becomes apparent why the assumption that taxation can leave the productive output of valuable assets unaffected and exclusively cripple consumption is fatally flawed. If taxation reduces one’s income (which includes that derived from present consumption and leisure), and given the universal fact of time preference, that is, that human actors invariably prefer present goods over future goods (that they cannot do without continuous consumption and can engage in lengthier, more roundabout methods of production only if a provision in the form of consumption goods has been made for the corresponding waiting period), then it necessarily follows that a person’s effective rate of time preference must have been raised through this very act (the disutility of waiting must have increased), and that he will have to shorten the length of the structure of production as compared to the one that he otherwise would have chosen. Accordingly, his output of valuable assets available at future dates will have to be lower than would be the case otherwise. If with lower or no taxation his income had been higher and his time preference schedule being given (whatever it happens to be at any particular point in time), he would have invested in lengthier production processes. As a consequence, his output of valuable future assets would have been relatively greater.[^7]

The error in the thesis that taxation can have a neutral effect on production lies in the fact that time preference is not taken into account. The argument presently under scrutiny is quite correct in pointing out that taxation implies a twofold signal: on the one hand the substitution effect working in favor of consumption and leisure and against work; and on the other hand the income effect of raising the marginal utility of the taxed asset. However, it is false to interpret this simplistically as a mixed bag of contradictory signals—one in favor of and one against work—so that one can then state nothing of a categorical nature regarding the effects of taxation on production, and the question of whether or not taxation provides for a lower or a higher output of valuable assets must be conceived of as an entirely empirical one.[^8] For in fact, the signal of taxation is not contradictory at all once it has been recognized that it is being sent to persons whose actions are invariably constrained by time preference. For such actors there exists not only the alternative between work and no work at all but also one between producing a valuable asset in more or less time-consuming ways. Invariably, they must also choose between obtaining an asset quickly and directly, with little waiting time involved, but at the price of having to resort to less efficient methods of production (the famous fisherman who decides to use his bare hands to catch fish in order to obtain it more quickly than by going through more roundabout methods of production), or obtaining it through more productive methods but then having to wait longer for them to bear fruit (the fisherman who, lured by higher future returns, decides to endure a longer waiting period and first builds a net). However, given these choices, the message of taxation is completely unambiguous and unequivocal, and there can no longer be any question that the substitution effect must be thought of as systematically dominating any income effect: If there is not only the option of having something or not having it but also of having less of something sooner or more of it later, the double message sent through taxation is easily integrated and translated into one: reduce the waiting time; shorten the roundabout methods of production! By doing so, valuable assets will be obtained earlier—in line with their increased marginal utility. Simultaneously, in shortening the waiting period, more room will be given for leisure—in line with its increased marginal utility. By reducing the length of roundabout methods of production the two seemingly contradictory signals stemming from taxation are simultaneously accounted for. Contrary to any claim of a systematically “neutral” effect of taxation on production, the consequence of any such shortening of roundabout methods of production is a lower output produced. The price that invariably must be paid for taxation, and for every increase in taxation, is a coercively lowered productivity that in turn reduces the standard of living in terms of valuable assets provided for future consumption. Every act of taxation necessarily exerts a push away from more highly capitalized, more productive production processes in the direction of a hand-to-mouth-existence.

[^7]: One might object here that the tax receipts will come into someone’s hands—those of government officials or of governmental transfer-paymentrecipients—and that their increased income, resulting in a lower effective time preference rate for them, may offset the increase in this rate on the taxpayers’ side and hence leave the overall rate and the structure of production unchanged. Such reasoning, however, is categorically flawed: For one thing, insofar as government expenditure is concerned, it cannot be regarded as investment at all. Rather, it is consumption, and consumption alone. For, as Rothbard has explained,

::::> [i]n any sort of division-of-labor economy, capital goods are built, not for their own sake by the investor, but in order to use them to produce lower-order and eventually consumers’ goods. In short, a characteristic of an investment expenditure is that the good in question is not being used to fulfill the needs of the investor, but of someone else—the consumer. Yet, when government confiscates resources from the private market economy, it is precisely defying the wishes of the consumers; when government invests in any good, it does so to serve the whims of government officials, not the desires of consumers. (*Man, Economy, and State*, pp. 816–17)

::::Thus, government expenditure, by definition, cannot be conceived of as lengthening the production structure and hence as counterbalancing the taxpayers’ raised time preference rate.—On the other hand,

::::> as for the *transfer* expenditures made by the government (including the salaries of bureaucrats and subsidies to privileged groups), it is true that some of this will be saved and invested. These investments, however, will not represent the voluntary desires of consumers, but rather investments in fields of production *not* desired by the *producing* consumers…. Once let the tax be eliminated, and … the new investments called forth by the demands of the specially privileged will turn out to be *malinvestments*. (*Power and Market*, p. 98)

::::Consequently, transfer expenditures also cannot be conceived of as compensating for the fact that taxpayers shorten the length of the production structure. All such expenditures can do is to lengthen the structure of mal-production. “At any rate” concludes Rothbard,

::::> the amount consumed by the government insures that the effect of income taxation will be to raise time-preference ratios and to reduce saving and investment. (Ibid., p. 98)
