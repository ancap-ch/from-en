## 第一版前言

整个东欧的社会主义崩塌，最戏剧性地体现是永生难忘的1989年11月9日的大事件，那天东德人和西德人感动又欣喜若狂的在柏林墙上团聚。整个东欧的社会主义崩塌给予本卷的中心论点增添的支持与紧迫感比我之前期望的还要多。

对经济问题如就业，利息，货币，银行，商业周期，税收，公共产品，经济增长和哲学问题的后续研究可作为基础知识，尤其可作为经济学与伦理学的基础知识。对例如剥削，人类文明的兴起与衰落，国际政治，战争，帝国主义和社会进化中过程中的思潮运动的每个历史或社会现象的重现与理论解释，只会最终得出一个结论：私人财产权具有无可争议的合法性，是伦理学的绝对原则，也是“最优”经济进步的基石。 To rise from the ruins of socialism and overcome the stagnation of the Western welfare states, nothing will suffice but the uncompromising privatization of all socialized, that is, government, property and the establishment of a contractual society based on the recognition of the absoluteness of private property rights.

In writing the following studies I received help from many sides. Special thanks go to my wife Margaret, who again took on the task of de-Germanizing my English; to Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and to Burton S. Blumert, president of the Center for Libertarian Studies, for their continuing support of my work; and to my friend David Gordon, for his numerous invaluable suggestions and comments.

My largest debt is to Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard, the twentieth century’s two greatest-though much neglected-economists and social philosophers. While I never met Ludwig von Mises, and indeed had not heard of his name until after his death, I am fortunate to have been closely associated with Murray Rothbard for the past six years, first in New York City, and since 1986 as colleagues at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Apart from the intellectual debt that I owe him, words cannot express my personal gratitude. His wisdom, insight, kindness, enthusiasm, and unflagging encouragement have been a continuous inspiration to me. It is, therefore, to him that this volume is dedicated.
