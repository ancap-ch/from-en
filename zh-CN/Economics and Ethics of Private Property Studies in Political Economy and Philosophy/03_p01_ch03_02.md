### 国家与货币和银行业的垄断

目前的经济秩序的特点是用由国家发行的货币代替统一的货币; 通过法定货币代替黄金等商品; 通过垄断中央银行而不是自由银行; 并通过永久性银行欺诈，稳定地重复进行收入和财富再分配，永久性通货膨胀和经常性的经济周期，而不是100％的储备银行业务，就不会产生这些后果。

那么，对于通过经济一体化来实现财富最大化的人的自身利益而言，完全矛盾的是，当前货币秩序的出现必然导致不同的反经济利益高于经济利益。[^9]

一个人可以通过宅基地、生产和合同交换，或者通过征用和剥削家庭稳定者、生产者或契约交换者来获得和增加财富，而没有别的办法。这两种方法对人类都是自然的。人类除了对生产和承包的兴趣外，一直对非生产性和非契约性的财产和财富的收购感兴趣。在经济发展的过程中，就像以前的利益可以导致生产企业和企业的形成一样，后者也会导致大规模的企业和政府或国家的产生。

一个生产企业的规模和成长，一方面受制于消费者的自愿需求，另一方面则是由于其他生产者的竞争，不断迫使每个企业在希望保持经营的前提下，以尽可能低的成本运作。对于这样一个规模增长的企业来说，最迫切的消费者需求必须以最有效的方式服务。只有自愿的消费者购买才能支持它的规模。

对另一种制度的约束——国家是完全不同的。[^10]一方面，很明显，它的出现和增长是由与经济公司同样的需求决定的，这显然是荒谬的。一个人不能说，在任何一种想象中，那些必须向一个国家交出(部分)资产的农场主、生产者和契约交换者都要求这样的服务。相反，他们是被迫接受的，这是一个确凿的证据，证明服务根本不需要。另一方面，国家也没有像生产企业那样受到竞争的限制。与这样的公司不同，国家不应将运营成本控制在最低限度，但可以以高于最低的成本运作，因为它可以通过征税或调整其行为来将成本上升转嫁到竞争对手身上。因此，当一个国家出现时，它就会这样做，尽管它既不要求也不高效。

公司的成长并没有受到成本和需求的限制，而是受到舆论的限制，即：非生产性和非契约性的财产收购需要强制，而强迫则会有受害者。可以想象，在一个人(或一群人)利用一个或两个或三个其它人(或一群大致相同的人)的情况下，抵抗会被持久地破坏。然而，难以想象的是仅凭武力就可以解释在实际熟悉的小少数民族中，对人口的侵占和剥削，他们的规模是几十、几百或数千倍。要做到这一点，企业除了要有强制的力量外，还必须有公众的支持。大多数人口必须接受其合法的行动。这种接受可以从主动的热情到被动的辞职。然而，接受它必须是在某种意义上，大多数人必须放弃主动或被动地抵制任何强制执行非生产性和非契约性的财产收购的想法。而不是表现出对这些行为的愤怒，对每一个参与其中的人表示轻蔑，对帮助他们成功(更不要说积极地阻止他们)没有任何帮助，大多数人必须主动或被动地支持他们。国家支持的公共舆论必须平衡受害者的反抗，这样积极的抵抗似乎是徒劳的。然后，国家的目标，以及每一个想要为保护和改善自己在国家内的地位做出贡献的国家雇员的目标，都是并且必须是通过创造有利的舆论和创造合法性来最大化地获取财富和收入。

政府可以采取两种补充措施来实现这一目标。一方面是思想宣传，很多时间和精力都花在了说服公众，让他们相信事情并非如他们所见：剥削才是真正的自由；税收实际上是自愿的，非契约关系实际上是“概念上的”契约关系；[^11]任何人都不受任何人的支配，但我们都统治着自己，没有国家，法律和安全都不存在；没有国家，穷人更加走向衰退等等。

另一方面，就是再分配。国家不再仅仅是其他国家生产的商品的寄生消费者，而是将一些强制性的财富分配给国家机构以外的人，从而试图使他们成为国家支持的角色。

但不是任何再分配都能做到。正如意识形态必须服务于一种静态的目的一样，再分配也必须如此。再分配需要成本支出需要理由。它不是由国家承担，只是为了给一些人做一些好事，例如，当某人给别人一个礼物时。它也不是简单地从交易所获得尽可能高的收入，就像普通的经济企业从事贸易一样。它是为了确保进一步存在和扩大剥削和征用而进行的。再分配必须符合这一战略目标。它的成本必须以增加国家收入和财富为理由。就像普通的商人一样，负责国家机构的政治企业家在这项任务中会犯错误，因为他们的决定必须在预期他们的实际结果的情况下作出再分配措施的最佳服务。如果企业家的错误发生了，国家的收入实际上可能会下降而不是上升，甚至可能危及自身的存在。这是国家政治的目的和政治企业家的功能，以避免这种情况，而选择一种增加国家收入的政策。

虽然不能预测特定形式的再分配政策或其特定的结果，但在变化的情况下，国家的性质仍然需要它的再分配政策必须遵循一定的秩序，并表现出一定的结构规律性。[^12]

As a firm engaged in the maximization of exploitatively appropriated wealth, the state’s first and foremost area in which it applies redistributive measures is the production of security, i.e., of police, defense, and a judicial system. The state ultimately rests on coercion and thus cannot do without armed forces. Any competing armed forces—which would naturally emerge on the market in order to satisfy a genuine demand for security and protection services—are a threat to its existence and must be eliminated. To do this is to arrogate the job to itself and become the monopolistic supplier and redistributor of protection services for a defined territory. Similarly, a competing judicial system would pose an immediate threat to a state’s claim to legitimacy. And again, for the sake of its own existence the judicial system must also be monopolized and legal services included in redistributive schemes.

The state’s nature as an institution engaged in organized aggression also explains the importance of the next field of redistributive activities: that of traffic and communication. There can be no regular exploitation without monopolistic control of rivers, coasts, seaways, streets, railroads, airports, mail, and telecommunication systems. Thus, these things, too, must become the object of redistribution.

Of similar importance is the field of education. Depending as it does on public opinion and its acceptance of the state’s actions as legitimate, it is essential for a state that unfavorable ideological competition be eliminated as far as possible and statist ideologies spread. The state attempts to accomplish this by providing educational services on a redistributive basis.

Furthered by a system of state education, the next crucial area for redistribution is that of redistributing state power itself, i.e., the right assumed by the state to expropriate, exploit and redistribute nonproductively appropriated assets. Instead of remaining an institution which restricts entry into itself and/or particular government positions, a state increasingly, and for obvious strategic reasons, adopts an organizational structure which in principle opens up every position to everyone and grants equal and universal rights of participation and competition in the determination of state policy. Everyone—not just a privileged nobility—receives a legal stake in the state in order to reduce the resistance to state power.[^13]

With the monopolization of law and security production, traffic, communication and education, as well as the democratization of state rule itself, all features of the modern state have been identified but one: the state’s monopolization of money and banking. For all but this one it has been explained, albeit briefly, how they can and must be understood as performing strategic functions: why and how they are not normal productive contributions determined by demand and supply forces or simply good deeds, but redistributive activities which serve the purpose of stabilizing and, if possible, increasing a state’s exploitatively appropriated income and wealth.

The monopolization of money and banking is the ultimate pillar on which the modern state rests. In fact, it has probably become the most cherished instrument for increasing state income. For nowhere else can the state make the connection between redistribution-expenditure and exploitation-return more directly, quickly and securely than by monopolizing money and banking. And nowhere else are the state’s schemes less clearly understood than here.

Preferring, like everyone, a higher to a lower income, yet unlike others, being in the business of nonproductive and noncontractual property acquisitions, the state’s position regarding money and banking is obvious: Its objectives are served best by a pure fiat money monopolistically controlled by the state. For only then are all barriers to counterfeiting removed (short of an entire breakdown of the monetary system through hyperinflation) and the state can increase its own income and wealth at another’s expense practically without cost and without having to fear bankruptcy.[^14]

However, there are obstacles in the way of attaining this enviable state of affairs. On one hand, there is the inexorable fact that money can emerge only as a commodity. (It is impossible to start out with fiat money).[^15] On the other hand, there is the problem that while enrichment through counterfeiting is no doubt less conspicuous than doing so by means of taxation, it is nonetheless a measure that is bound to be noticed, certainly by the banks, particularly if it occurs on a regular basis. And so it is also impossible for the state to get away with institutionalized counterfeiting unless it can be combined with redistributive measures which are capable of bringing about another favorable change in public opinion. This problem and the state’s natural desire essentially determine the course of its actions.

As the result of free market processes, the state finds gold established as money and a system of free banking. Its goal is the destruction of this system and with it the removal of all obstacles to counterfeiting. Technically (ignoring for the moment all psychological difficulties involved in this), the sequence of steps that must be taken in order to accomplish this objective is then dictated: In a first step the minting of gold must be monopolized by the state. This serves the purpose of psychologically denationalizing gold by shifting the emphasis from gold as denominated in universal terms of weight to gold as denominated in terms of fiat labels. And it removes a first important obstacle toward counterfeiting because it gives the state the very institutional means of enriching itself through a systematic process of currency debasement.

[^9]: Contrary to the claim of the public choice school, states and private firms are not doing essentially the same sort of business, but instead are engaged in categorically different types of operations. Both types of institutions are the outcome of different, antagonistic interests. The “political” interest in exploitation and expropriation underlying the formation of states obviously requires and presupposes the existence of wealth, and hence an “economic” interest of at least one person in producing such wealth in the first place (while the reverse is not true). But at the same time, the more pronounced and successful political interests are, the more destructive of economic interests this will be. The public choice school is perfectly correct in pointing out that everyone—a government employee no less than an employee of an economic firm—normally prefers a higher to a lower income and that this interest explains why government should be expected to have no less of a tendency to grow than any other enterprise.

::::However, this discovery—that politicians and bureaucrats are no more altruistic or concerned about the public good than are people in other walks of life—is hardly new even if it has sometimes been overlooked. Yet what is in fact new with public choice is the inference drawn from this correct insight then, that all institutions should hence be regarded as an outgrowth of identical motivational forces and be treated analytically on a par with each other—is false to the point of being ridiculous. Regardless of a person’s subjective beliefs, integrating one’s actions into the institutional framework of either the state or a “normal” economic enterprise and pursuing one’s wealth maximizing interests here or there will in fact produce categorically different outcomes.
