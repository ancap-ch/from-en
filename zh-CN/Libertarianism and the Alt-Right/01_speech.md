我们知道自由主义和自由主义这一术语的命运。它被贴在许多不同的人和不同的位置上，使它失去了所有的意义，变成了一个空洞的、没有描述的标签。同样的命运现在也越来越威胁到自由主义和自由意志主义这个词, 这术语是为了重新获得一些由于前标签的消亡而丧失的概念精确性。

然而，现代自由主义的历史还很年轻。它开始在 Murray Rothbard 的起居室，却发现第一个准正则表达在他*的一个新的自由。自由主义宣言*，发表于1973年出版。所以我仍然抱有希望，不愿意放弃对自由主义的定义和解释 Rothbard 的无可匹敌的概念清晰、准确，尽管同时所谓的自由主义者无数次地试图诋毁水和盗用自由主义的好名字的东西完全不同。 

自由主义学说的理论上无可辩驳的核心是简单明了的，我已经在这个地方反复解释过了。如果世界上没有稀缺，就不可能有人类冲突，更确切地说是身体上的冲突。
人际冲突总是与稀缺事物发生冲突。我想用一个给定的东西来做A，而你想用同样的东西来做B。由于这样的冲突 - 因为我们能够相互沟通和争论 - 我们寻求行为规范以避免这些冲突。所以我们寻求行为准则来避免这些冲突。规范的目的是避免冲突。如果我们不想避免冲突，那么寻求行为规范就毫无意义了。我们只会反抗和斗争。


如果没有所有利益的完美和谐，只有将所有稀缺资源分配给特定的个人或群体，才能避免稀缺资源的冲突。只有这样，我才能独立行动，拥有我自己的东西，从你那里，拥有你自己的东西，没有你和我的冲突。

但是，谁拥有什么样的稀缺资源作为他的私人财产，谁不拥有呢？第一：每个人都拥有只有他和其他人无法直接控制的自己。第二，对于可控制的稀缺资源，仅间接地[^1]：独占控制[^2]是由该人获得的，并分配给该人，该人首先划拨所涉资源，或通过其先前的所有者自愿的[^3]交换获得该资源。只有第一个充当一个资源[^4]可能获得和增益控制它没有冲突，即和平。否则，如果将排他性控制权转让给“后来者”，则不能避免冲突，而是违背了不可避免和永久性的规范的目的。

在这个听众面前，我不需要详细说明，除了补充一点：如果你想生活在与其他人和平，避免所有的物理冲突，如果冲突发生时，寻求以和平方式解决它们，那么你一定是个无政府主义者，或者更准确地说是一个私人财产的无政府主义者，无政府资本主义或主张私法社会。

而且暗示，再一次没有更多的遗憾：任何人都不是一个自由主义者，或者只是一个自由主义者，他们肯定并主张以下一个或多个方面：一个国家，一个国家，一个国家，公共（州）财产和税收以维持和平;或者除“私权”以外的所谓“人权”或“公民权利”的存在和合理性，如“女权”，“同性恋权利”，“少数人权利”，“不受歧视的权利”反对自由和不受限制的移民的“权利”，保证最低收入或免费医疗保健的“权利”，或免于不愉快的言论和思想的“权利”。任何一方的支持者都可以自称无论他们想要什么，作为自由主义者，我们可以与他们合作，因为这样的合作提供了使我们更接近我们最终目标的承诺，但他们不是自由主义者，或伪*自由主义者。

现在，“在去论坛的路上发生了一件有趣的事”。而Rothbard和我，跟随他的脚步，从来没有偏离这些理论推导的核心信念，不只是非自由主义者尤其是假自由，即人们声称（错误地）*是*自由论者，甚至很多可能诚实而愚蠢的自由选择和诋毁我们自己喜欢的*“可怕之处”*体现了邪恶。Rothbard 是现代自由主义的精神领袖，已经被这个所谓的“反法西斯”的人群作为一个反动、种族歧视、性别歧视、专制、精英，一个排外，法西斯和，最重要的是，自我憎恨犹太人的纳粹。我继承了所有这些荣誉头衔，再加上一些（除了犹太人的东西）。那么这里发生了什么有趣的事情？ 

试图发展这一问题的答案给我这次演讲的主题：自由意志和选择权或“替代权利之间的关系，”已获得国家和国际名声的Hillary Clinton之后，最后的总统竞选期间，确定它为一体的灵感背后的“一揽子可装备品”生根[ 5 ] ^为王牌。

Alt-Right运动本质上是90年代初兴起古代保守主义运动的继承者，专栏作家和畅销书作家Patrick Buchanan是最着名的代表。在二十世纪九十年代后期，这种情况已经有些休眠了。最近，鉴于对美国的不断增长的损害以及连续的 Bush I，Clinton 克林顿，Bush II 和 Obama 奥巴马政府的声誉，在新标签下重新焕发了生机。与Alt-Right相关的许多领先的灯光在这些年来出现在我们的会议上。首先提出这个词的 Paul Gottfried 保罗•戈特弗里德，Peter Brimelow 彼得•布里默洛，Richard Lynn 理查德•林恩，Jared Taylor 杰瑞德•泰勒，John Derbyshire 约翰•德比郡，Steve Sailer 史蒂夫•赛勒和 Richard Spencer 理查德•斯宾塞。同时，Sean Gabb的名字和我的名字经常与Alt-Right连接经常提到的，我的作品也与Curtis Yarvin [^ 6]和他现在已经不存在的博客* Unqualified Reservations *。总之，这些个人的关系赢得了我几个荣誉奖由美国最著名的诽谤和诽谤联盟， SPLC [^7]。

现在：自由主义与“权利”之间的关系如何? 请问“自由主义”的主要代表与自由主义者会面的理由如何呢？自由主义者的无可辩驳的理论核心信念在一开始就提到美国。他们清楚地知道他们想要达到的目标。但是自由主义学说如果涉及到这些问题，并不意味着太多：

1. 如何维持自由主义秩序一旦实现；
2. 如何从非自由主义的起点实现自由意志主义秩序，这需要：
    i.  一个人必须正确地描述这个出发点；
    ii.  正确地从这个出发点找出个人自由意志方式的障碍。

为了回答这些问题，除了理论，还需要一些类心理学和社会学或常识至少一点点知识。然而，许多自由主义者和假自由主义者对于人类心理学和社会学甚至是没有任何常识的人都是无知的。他们盲目地接受所有经验主义的证据，即对所有人和所有社会和文化本质上平等和可互换的平等主义、空白的人性观。

虽然当代自由主义可以表征，那么，没有心理学和社会学的理论和理论家，甚至大部分的ALT就可以描述的，相反，如心理学和社会学没有理论。。 Alt-Righters并不是由一个普遍持有的理论联合在一起的，甚至没有任何东西甚至与规范它的含义的规范文本微不足道。相反，ALT权利在描述当代世界，特别是美国和所谓的西方世界，以及对其社会病态的识别和诊断方面基本上是统一的。事实上，人们已经正确地注意到，Alt 的权利与其说是反对，不如说是团结一致。它是反对的，而且它确实怀着激情，控制国家的精英，男同性恋者和学术界。为什么？因为它们都促进了社会退化和病理学。因此，他们提倡，和ALT右大力反对平均主义，肯定性行动[^8]，多元文化，和“自由”的大规模移民作为一种手段，使多元文化有关。同时，ALT权利 厌恶一切的文化主义或策略上明智地耸耸肩和所有的“政治正确”，没有任何道歉，所有的指控是种族歧视，性别歧视，精英主义、至上主义者，同性恋恐惧症，恐惧，等等，等等，ALT 权利 也笑了那ï无可救药我所谓的自由主义者的纲领性口号如学生自由[^9] “和平，爱，和自由，“适当地翻译成德语的Lichtschlag为“Friede，Freude，Eierkuchen” . 与此形成鲜明对比的，ALT Righters坚持认为生活是关于冲突，仇恨，斗争，斗争，不只是个体之间也不同群体间的一致行动。“千年问题”[^10] 因此恰当地总结了ALT权利：

> 平等是胡说。层次结构是必不可少的。比赛是不同的。性别不同。道德问题和退化是真实的。所有的文化都是不平等的，我们没有义务认为他们是。人是一个堕落的人，生命比空洞的唯物主义更重要。最后，白种人是重要的，文明是宝贵的。这是ALT权利。

然而，如果没有任何统一的理论，ALT权利最终想要实现的目标之间的一致性就少得多了。许多重要人物有明显的自由主义倾向，尤其是那些来这里 [^ 11]，即使他们不是100%者不认同自己是这样的。ALT Righters出现在这里，例如，已经熟悉 Rothbard 和他的工作，而所有的自由党最近的总统候选人甚至从来没有听说过Rothbard的名字，和所有的人，据我所知，Ron Paul的直言不讳的支持者他的主要竞选期间为共和党的总统候选人提名，而所有很多自称自由主义者的攻击，试图诋毁Ron Paul为他所谓的-你已经知道的来了“种族主义者”的观点。

然而，一些ALT权利的领导人和许多其职级和文件的追随者也赞同的观点不符合自由主义。卜婵安与特朗普之前，他们是互补的政策限制态度坚决，高选择性和歧视移民[^12]与限制贸易的强硬政策，经济保护主义和保护关税 [^13], [^14]。

还有一些人甚至走到更远的地方，比如Richard Spencer，他最初推广了ALT这个词。与此同时，由于最近的几次宣传噱头，使他在美国获得了一定程度的恶名，斯宾塞宣称拥有一个据称是强大统一运动的最高领导人的排名[ 15 ]。当斯宾塞出现在这里，几年前，他仍然表现出强烈的自由主义倾向。然而不幸的是，然而，这已经发生了变化，Spencer 斯宾塞现在宣布，没有任何资格可言，所有的自由主义者和自由主义者，都已经走了这么远，甚至把社会主义，只要是社会主义，只有白人。多么令人失望的失望！

鉴于缺乏任何理论基础，这一分裂的ALT权利运动成对立派系几乎不能被视为一个惊喜。然而，这个事实不应该误导人解雇，因为ALT权利也带来了许多的见解，是在接近一个回答前面提到的两个问题悬而未决的自由主义理论中心的重要性：如何维持一个自由社会秩序如何得到这样的命令从当前，不自由的状态现状。ALT权利没有发现这些见解。他们早就建立起来了，实际上，在很大程度上，它们不过是常识而已。但是最近这种见解被埋在平等主义的左派宣传的高山之下，必须记住Alt的权利是因为把它们带回来的

为了说明这种见解的重要性，让我先回答第一个未回答的问题。

许多自由主义者认为，所有这一切都需要维持一个自由社会的秩序是非侵略性的原则严格执法（NAP）。否则，只要不放弃侵略，就应该坚持“活下去”的原则。然而，虽然这种“自己活也让别人活”的声音吸引青少年反抗父母的权威，所有的社会公约和控制[^16] ，虽然原理确实把握和申请人分开生活和处理彼此只能间接地远道而来的，它不拥有和运用，或而这是不够的，当它涉及到居住在靠近彼此的人，邻居和同一社区的同居者。

A simple example suffices to make the point. Assume a new next-door neighbor. This neighbor does not aggress against you or your property in any way, but he is a “bad” neighbor. He is littering on his own neighboring property, turning it into a garbage heap; in the open, for you to see, he engages in ritual animal slaughter, he turns his house into a “Freudenhaus,” a bordello, with clients coming and going all day and all night long; he never offers a helping hand and never keeps any promise that he has made; or he cannot or else he refuses to speak to you in your own language. Etc., etc.. Your life is turned into a nightmare. Yet you may not use violence against him, because he has not aggressed against you. What can you do? You can shun and ostracize him. But your neighbor does not care, and in any case you alone thus ‘punishing’ him makes little if any difference to him. You have to have the communal respect and authority, or you must turn to someone who does, to persuade and convince everyone or at least most of the members of your community to do likewise and make the bad neighbor a social outcast, so as to exert enough pressure on him to sell his property and leave.

The lesson? The peaceful cohabitation of neighbors and of people in regular direct contact with each other on some territory – a tranquil, convivial social order – requires also a commonality of culture: of language, religion, custom and convention. There can be peaceful co-existence of different cultures on distant, physically separated territories, but multi-culturalism, cultural heterogeneity, cannot exist in one and the same place and territory without leading to diminishing social trust, increased tension, and ultimately the call for a “strong man” and the destruction of anything resembling a libertarian social order.

And moreover: Just as a libertarian order must always be on guard against “bad” (even if non-aggressive) neighbors by means of social ostracism, i.e., by a common “you are *not* welcome here” culture, so, and indeed even more vigilantly so, must it be guarded against neighbors who openly advocate communism, socialism, syndicalism or democracy in any shape or form. They, in thereby posing an open threat to all private property and property owners, must not only be shunned, but they must, to use a by now somewhat famous Hoppe-meme, be “physically removed,” if need be by violence, and forced to leave for other pastures. Not to do so inevitably leads to – well, communism, socialism, syndicalism or democracy and hence, the very opposite of a libertarian social order.

With these “rightist” or as I would say, plain commonsensical insights in mind I turn now to the more challenging question of how to move from here, the *status quo*, to there. And for this it might be instructive to first briefly consider the answer given by the liberallala, the peace-love-and-liberty, the Friede-Freude-Eierkuchen or the capitalism-is-love libertarians. It reveals the same fundamental egalitarianism, if in a slightly different form, as that exhibited also by the live-and-let-live libertarians. These, as I have just tried to show, define what we may call the “bad neighbor problem” – and what is merely a short-hand for the general problem posed by the co-existence of distinctly different, alien, mutually disturbing, annoying, strange or hostile cultures – simply out of existence. And indeed, if you assume, against all empirical evidence, that all people, everywhere, are essentially the same, then, by definition, no such thing as a “bad neighbor problem” exists.

The same egalitarian, or as the liberallala-libertarians themselves prefer call it, “humanitarian” spirit also comes to bear in their answer to the question of a libertarian *strategy*. In a nutshell, their advice is this: be nice and talk to everyone – and then, in the long run, the better libertarian arguments will win out. To illustrate, take my former-friend-turned-foe Jeffrey Tucker’s five “Don’ts When Talking Liberty.” They are:

1. don’t be belligerent;
2. don’t presume hatred of liberty; 
3. don’t presume different goals;
4. don’t presume ignorance;
5. don’t regard anyone as an enemy.”

Now, quite apart from the fact that Tucker does not seem to follow his own advice in his belligerent condemnation of the entire Alt-Right as liberty-hating fascists, I find his exhortations truly astounding. They may be good advice vis-à-vis people just sprung up from nowhere, without any traceable history whatsoever, but vis-à-vis real people with a recorded history they strike me as hopelessly naïve, unrealistic, and outright counterproductive in the pursuit of libertarian ends. For I (and I assume everyone else here) know of and have met many people in my life who *are* ignorant, who *do* have different, un-libertarian goals, and who *do* hate liberty as understood by libertarians – and why in the world should I *not* regard such people as fools or enemies? And why should I *not* hate and *not* be belligerent vis-a-vis my enemies?

As a libertarian strategy, then, Tucker’s advice must be considered simply a bad joke. But surely it is good advice if one seeks entry into the State as some sort of “libertarian” advisor, and this may well explain the enthusiasm with which Tucker’s “humanitarian” libertarianism has been embraced by the entire liberallala-libertarian crowd.

Outside egalitarian phantasy lands, however, in the real world, libertarians must above all be *realistic* and recognize from the outset, as the Alt-Right does, the inequality not just of individuals but also of different cultures as an ineradicable *datum* of the human existence. We must further recognize that there exist plenty of enemies of liberty as defined by libertarianism and that they, not we, are in charge of worldly affairs; that in many parts of the contemporary world their control of the populace is so complete that the ideas of liberty and of a libertarian social order are practically unheard of or considered unthinkable[^18]; and that it is essentially only in the West, in the countries of Western and Central Europe and the lands settled by its people, that the idea of liberty is so deeply rooted that these enemies still can be openly challenged. And confining our strategic considerations here only to the West, then, we can identify, pretty much as the Alt-Right has effectively done, these actors and agencies as our principal enemies.

They are:

1. The ruling elites in control of the State apparatus and in particular the “Deep State” or the so-called “Cathedral” of the military, the secret services, the central banks and the supreme courts. As well, they include: 
    1. The leaders of the military-industrial complex, i.e., of nominally private firms that owe their very existence to the State as the exclusive or dominant buyer of their products;
    2. The leaders of the big commercial banks, which owe their privilege of creating money and credit out of thin air to the existence of the central bank and its role as a “lender of last resort”. They together, then, State, Big-Business and Big-Banking, form an extremely powerful even if tiny “mutual admiration society,” jointly ripping off the huge mass of tax-payers and living it up big time at their expense.
2. ([A] much larger group of enemies is made up of) the intellectuals, educators and “educrats,” from the highest levels of academia down to the level of elementary schools and kindergartens. Funded almost exclusively, whether directly or indirectly, by the State, they, in their overwhelming majority, have become the soft tools and willing executioners in the hands of the ruling elite and its designs for absolute power and total control.
3. The journalists of the MSM, as the docile products of the system of “public education,” and the craven recipients and popularizers of government “information.”

Equally important in the development of a libertarian strategy then is the immediately following next question: who are the *victims*? The standard libertarian answer to this is: the tax-*payers* as opposed to the tax-*consumers*. Yet while this is essentially correct, it is at best only part of the answer, and libertarians could learn something in this respect from the Alt-Right: because apart from the narrowly economic aspect there is also a wider cultural aspect that must be taken into account in identifying the victims.

In order to expand and increase its power, the ruling elites have been conducting for many decades what Pat Buchanan has identified as a systematic “culture war,” aimed at a trans-valuation of all values and the destruction of all natural, or if you will “organic” social bonds and institutions such as families, communities, ethnic groups and genealogically related nations, so as to create an increasingly atomized populace, whose only shared characteristic and unifying bond is its common existential dependency on the State. The first step in this direction, taken already half a century or even longer ago, was the introduction of “public welfare” and “social security.” Thereby, the underclass and the elderly were turned into State-dependents and the value and importance of family and community was correspondingly diminished and weakened. More recently, further-reaching steps in this direction have proliferated. A new “victimology” has been proclaimed and promoted. Women, and in particular single mothers, Blacks, Browns, Latinos, homosexuals, lesbians, bi- and transsexuals have been awarded “victim” status and accorded legal privileges through non-discrimination or affirmative action decrees. As well, most recently such privileges have been expanded also to foreign-national immigrants, whether legal or illegal, insofar as they fall into one of the just mentioned categories or are members of non-Christian religions such as Islam, for instance. The result? Not only has the earlier mentioned “bad neighbor problem” not been avoided or solved, but systematically promoted and intensified instead. Cultural homogeneity has been destroyed, and the freedom of association, and the voluntary physical segregation and separation of different people, communities, cultures and traditions has been replaced by an all-pervasive system of forced social integration. Moreover, each mentioned “victim” group has thus been pitted against every other, and all of them have been pitted against white, heterosexual, Christian males and in particular those married and with children as the only remaining, legally un-protected group of alleged “victimizers.” Hence, as the result of the trans-valuation of all values promoted by the ruling elites, the world has been turned upside down. The institution of a family household with father, mother and their children that has formed the basis of Western civilization, as the freest, most industrious, ingenious and all-around accomplished civilization known to mankind, i.e., the very institution and people that has done most good in human history, has been officially stigmatized and vilified as the source of all social ills and made the most heavily disadvantaged, even persecuted group by the enemy elites’ relentless policy of *divide et impera*.

Accordingly, given the present constellation of affairs, then, any promising libertarian strategy must, very much as the Alt-Right has recognized:

1. Be tailored and addressed to this group of the most severely victimized people. White married Christian couples with children, in particular if they belong also to the class of tax-*payers* (rather than tax-consumers), and everyone most closely resembling or aspiring to this standard form of social order and organization can be realistically expected to be the most receptive audience of the libertarian message[^19]. Given this constellation of perpetrator-enemies vs. victims in the contemporary West, then, I can now come to the final task of trying to outline a realistic libertarian strategy for change. The specifics of which will have to be prefaced by two general considerations. For one, given that the class of intellectuals from the tops of *academia* to the opinion-molding journalists in the MSM are funded by and firmly tied into the ruling system, i.e., that they are a part of the *problem*, they also should not be expected to play a major if any role in the problem’s *solution*. Accordingly, the so-called Hayekian strategy for social change, that envisions the spread of correct libertarian ideas starting at the top, with the leading philosophers, and then trickling down from there to journalists and finally to the great unwashed masses, must be considered fundamentally unrealistic. Instead, any realistic libertarian strategy for change must be a *populist* strategy. That is, libertarians must short-circuit the dominant intellectual elites and address the masses directly to arouse their indignation and contempt for the ruling elites.
2. All the while the main addressees of a populist libertarian message must be indeed the just mentioned groups of dispossessed and disenfranchised native whites, I believe it to be a serious strategic error to make “whiteness” the exclusive criterion on which to base one’s strategic decisions, as some strands of the Alt-Right have suggested to do. After all, it is above all white men that make up the ruling elite and that have foisted the current mess upon us. True enough, the various protected “minorities” mentioned before take full advantage of the legal privileges they have been accorded and they have become increasingly emboldened to ask for ever more “protection,” but none of them and all of them together did not and do not possess the intellectual prowess that would have made this outcome possible, if it were not for the instrumental help that they received and are receiving from white men.

Now, taking our cues from the Buchanan-, the Paul- and the Trump-movement, on to the specifics of a populist strategy for libertarian change, in no specific order except for the very first one, which has currently assumed the greatest urgency in the public mind.

#### Stop mass immigration

The waves of immigrants currently flooding the Western world have burdened it with hordes of welfare parasites, brought in terrorists, increased crime, led to the proliferation of no-go areas and resulted in countless “bad neighbors” who, based on their alien upbringing, culture and traditions, lack any understanding and appreciation of liberty and are bound to become mindless future supporters of welfare-Statism.

No one is against immigration and immigrants *per se*. But immigration must be by invitation only. All immigrants must be productive people and hence, be barred from all domestic welfare payments. To ensure this, they or their inviting party must place a bond with the community in which they are to settle, and which is to be forfeited and lead to the immigrant’s deportation should he ever become a public burden. As well, every immigrant, inviting party or employer should not only pay for the immigrant’s upkeep or salary, but must also pay the residential community for the additional wear and tear of its public facilities associated with the immigrant’s presence, so as to avoid the socialization of any and all costs incurred with his settlement. Moreover, even before his admission, every potential immigrant invitee must be carefully screened and tested not only for his productivity but also for cultural affinity (or “good neighborliness”) – with the empirically predictable result of mostly, but by no means exclusively, western-white immigrant-candidates. And any known communist or socialist, of any color, denomination or country of origin, must be barred from permanent settlement – unless, that is, the community where the potential immigrant wants to settle officially sanctions the looting of its residents’ property by new, foreign arrivals, which is not very likely to say the least (even within already existing ‘commie’ communes).[^20]

#### Stop attacking, killing and bombing people in foreign countries

A main cause, even if by no means the only one, for the current invasion of Western countries by hordes of alien immigrants, are the wars initiated and conducted in the Middle East and elsewhere by the US’ ruling elites and their subordinate Western puppet-elites. As well, the by now seemingly ‘normal’ and ubiquitous terrorist attacks in the name of Islam across the Western world are in large measure the “blow-back” of these wars and the ensuing chaos throughout the Middle East and Northern Africa. There should be no hesitation to call these Western rulers what they are: murderers or accessories to mass murder. We must demand, and cry out loud instead for a foreign policy of strict non-interventionism. Withdraw from all international and supranational organizations such as the UN, NATO and the EU that intricate one country into the domestic affairs of another. Stop all government-to-government aid and prohibit all weapon sales to foreign States. Let it be *America First!, England First!, Germany First!, Italy First!*, and so on, i.e., each country trading with one another and no one interfering in anyone else’s domestic affairs.

#### Defund the ruling elites and its intellectual bodyguards

Expose and widely publicize the lavish salaries, perks, pensions, side-deals, bribes and hush monies received by the ruling elites: by the higher-ups in government and governmental bureaucracies, of supreme courts, central banks, secret services and spy agencies, by politicians, parliamentarians, party leaders, political advisors and consultants, by crony-capitalists, “public educrats,” university presidents, provosts and academic “stars.” Drive home the point that all their shining glory and luxury is funded by money extorted from tax-payers, and consequently urge that any and all taxes be slashed: income taxes, property taxes, sales taxes, inheritance taxes, etc., etc..

#### End the FED and all central banks

The second source of funding for the ruling elites, besides the money extorted from the public in the form of taxes, comes from the central banks. Central banks are allowed to create paper money out of thin air. This reduces the purchasing power of money and destroys the savings of average people. It does not and cannot make society as a whole richer, but it redistributes income and wealth within society. The earliest receivers of the newly created money, i.e., the ruling elites, are thereby made richer and the later and latest receivers, i.e., the average citizen, are made poorer. The central bank’s manipulation of interest rates is the cause of boom-bust cycles. The central bank permits the accumulation of ever greater “public debt” that is shifted as a burden onto unknown future taxpayers or is simply inflated away. And as the facilitator of public debt, the central banks are also the facilitators of wars. This monstrosity must end and be replaced by a system of free, competitive banking built on the foundation of a genuine commodity money such as gold or silver.

#### Abolish all ‘affirmative action’ and ‘non-discrimination’ laws and regulations

All such edicts are blatant violations of the principle of the equality before the law that, at least in the West, is intuitively sensed and recognized as a fundamental principle of justice. As private property owners, people must be free to associate or disassociate with others: to include or exclude, to integrate or segregate, to join or separate, to unify and incorporate or to disunite, exit and secede. Close all university departments for Black-, Latino-, Women-, Gender-, Queer-Studies, etc., etc., as incompatible with science and dismiss its faculties as intellectual imposters or scoundrels. As well, demand that all affirmative action commissars, diversity and human resources officers, from universities on down to schools and kindergartens, be thrown out onto the street and be forced to learn some useful trade.

#### Crush the “Anti-Fascist” Mob

The trans-valuation of all values throughout the West: the invention of ever more “victim groups,” the spread of “affirmative action” programs and the relentless promotion of “political correctness,” has led to the rise of an “anti-fascist” mob. Tacitly supported and indirectly funded by the ruling elites, this self-described mob of “social justice warriors” has taken upon itself the task of escalating the fight against “white privilege” through deliberate acts of terror directed against anyone and anything deemed “racist,” “right-wing,” “fascist,” “reactionary,” “incorrigible” or “unreconstructed.” Such “enemies of progress” are physically assaulted by the “anti-fascist” mob, their cars are burnt down, their properties vandalized, and their employers threatened to dismiss them and ruin their careers – all the while the police are ordered by the powers that be to “stand down” and not to investigate the crimes committed or prosecute and punish the criminals. In view of this outrage, public anger must be aroused and there must be clamoring, far and wide, for the police to be unleashed and this mob be beaten into submission.[^21]

#### Crush the street criminals and gangs

In dispensing with the principle of the equality before the law and awarding all sorts of group privileges (except to the one group of married white Christian men and their families) the ruling elites have also dispensed with the principle of equal punishment for equal crime. Some State-favored groups are handed more lenient punishment for the same crime than others, and some especially favored groups are simply let run wild and go practically unpunished at all, thus actually and effectively promoting crime. As well, no-go areas have been permitted to develop where any effort at law-enforcement has essentially ceased to exist and where violent thugs and street gangs have taken over. In view of this, public furor must be provoked and it be unmistakably demanded that the police crack-down quick and hard on any robber, mugger, rapist and murderer, and ruthlessly clear all current no-go areas of violent gang-rule. Needless to say that this policy should be colorblind, but if it happens to be, as it in fact does, that most street criminals or gang members are young Black or Latino males or, in Europe, young immigrant males from Africa, the Middle East, the Balkans or Eastern Europe, then so be it and such human specimen then should be the ones that most prominently get their noses bloodied. And needless to say also that in order to defend against crime, whether ordinary street crime or acts of terrorism, all prohibitions against the ownership of guns by upstanding citizen should be abolished.

#### Get rid of all welfare parasites and bums

To cement their own position, the ruling class has put the underclass on the dole and thus made it a most reliable source of public support. Allegedly to help people rise and move up from the underclass to become self-supporting actors, the real – and actually intended – effect of the State’s so-called “social policy” is the exact opposite. It has rendered a person’s underclass status more permanent and made the underclass steadily grow (and with this also the number of tax-funded social workers and therapists assigned to “help and assist” it). For, in accordance with inexorable economic law, every subsidy awarded on account of some alleged need or deficiency produces more, not less, of the problem that it is supposed to alleviate or eliminate. Thus, the root cause of a person’s underclass status: his low impulse control and high time preference, i.e., his uncontrolled desire for immediate gratification, and the various attendant manifestations of this cause, such as unemployment, poverty, alcoholism, drug abuse, domestic violence, divorce, female headed households, out-of-wedlock births, rotating shack-up male companions, child abuse, negligence and petty crime, is and are not alleviated or eliminated but systematically strengthened and promoted. Instead of continuing and expanding this increasingly unsightly social disaster, then, it should be abolished and be loudly demanded that one take heed of the biblical exhortation that he who can, but will not work, also shall not eat, and that he who truly cannot work, due to severe mental or physical deficiencies, be taken care of by family, community and voluntary charity.

#### Get the State out of education

Most, if not all, social pathologies plaguing the contemporary West have their common root in the institution of “public education.” When the first steps were taken, more than two centuries ago, in Prussia, to supplement and ultimately replace a formerly completely private system of education with a universal system of compulsory “public education,” the time spent in State-run schools did in most cases not exceed four years. Today, throughout the entire Western world, the time spent in institutions of “public education” is, at a minimum, around ten years, and in many cases, and increasingly so, twenty or even thirty years. That is, a large or even the largest part of time during the most formative period in a person’s life is spent in State-funded and State-supervised institutions, whose primary purpose from the very beginning it was *not* to raise an enlightened public, but to train “good soldiers” and “good public servants:” not independent and mature or “mündige Bürger,” but subordinate and servile “Staats-Bürger.” The result? The indoctrination has worked: the longer the time a person has spent within the system of public education, the more he is committed to leftist-egalitarian ideas and has swallowed and wholeheartedly internalized the official doctrine and agenda of “political correctness.” Indeed, in particular among social science teachers and professors, people *not* counting themselves as part of the Left have practically ceased to exist. Consequently, it must be demanded that the control of schools and universities be wrest away from the central State and, in a first step, be returned to regional or better still local and locally funded authorities, and ultimately be completely privatized, so as to replace a system of compulsory uniformity and conformity with a system of decentralized education that reflects the natural variation, multiplicity and diversity of human talents and interests.

#### Don’t put your trust in politics or political parties

Just as *academia* and the academic world cannot be expected to play any significant role in a libertarian strategy for social change, so with politics and political parties – after all, it is the ultimate goal of libertarianism to put an end to all politics, and to subject all interpersonal relations and conflicts to private law and civil law procedures. To be sure, under present, all-pervasively politicized conditions an involvement in politics and party politics cannot be entirely avoided. However, in any such involvement one must be keenly aware of and guard against the corrupting influence of power and the lure of money and perks that comes with it. And to minimize this risk and temptation, it is advisable to concentrate one’s efforts on the level of regional and local rather than national politics, and there to promote a radical agenda of decentralization: of nullification and peaceful separation, segregation and secession. Most importantly, however, we must take heed of Ludwig von Mises’ life-motto: Do not give in to evil, but proceed ever more boldly against it. That is, we must speak out whenever and wherever, whether in formal or informal gatherings, against anyone affronting us with by now only all-too-familiar “politically correct” drivel and left-egalitarian balderdash and unmistakably say: “No. Hell no. You must be kidding.” In the meantime, given the almost complete mind-control exercised by the ruling elites, *academia* and the MSM, it already requires a good portion of courage to do so. But if we are not brave enough to do so now and thus set an example for others to follow, matters will become increasingly worse and more dangerous in the future, and we, Western civilization and the Western ideas of freedom and liberty will be wiped out and vanish.

[^20]: Brief message to all open-border and liberallala libertarians, who will surely label this, you guessed it, “fascist”: In a fully privatized libertarian order there exists no such thing as a right to free immigration. Private property implies borders and the owner’s right to exclude at will. And “public property” has borders as well. It is not unowned. It is the property of domestic tax-payers and most definitely not the property of foreigners. And while it is true that the State is a criminal organization and that to entrust it with the task of border control will inevitably result in numerous injustices to both domestic residents and foreigners, it is also true that the State *does something* also when it decides *not* to do anything about border control and that, under the present circumstances, doing nothing at all in this regard will lead to even more and much graver injustices, in particular to the domestic citizenry.

[^21]: Query for liberallala-libertarians and the Stupids for Liberty, who are sure to object to this demand on the ground that the police asked to crush the “anti-fascist” mob are *State-_police: Do you also object, on the same grounds, that the police arrest murderers or rapists? Aren’t these legitimate tasks performed also in any libertarian order by _private* police? And if the police are not to do anything about this mob, isn’t it o.k. then that the target of its attacks, the “racist Right,” should take the task upon itself of giving the “social justice warriors” a bloody nose?
