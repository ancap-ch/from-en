## Introduction

For countless generations, mankind lived in a kind of egocentric womb of self-imposed ignorance: the world was flat, the sun, moon and stars revolved around him, ancestors beckoned to him from beyond the mists of death, and thunder was the anger of the gods.

Burrowing out from this narcissistic womb of subjective interpretation required the labour of millennia – and cost the lives of millions. The effort required to wrench our perspective from *perceptual experience* to *conceptual logic* was terrifying, exhilarating, highly disorienting and extremely dangerous. Understanding that the world was not what it *felt like*, or *seemed like*, was – and remains – the greatest feat of our intelligence. The *truth* of reality turned out to be in the eyes of the mind, not of the flesh.

The world looks flat; it is not. The sun and the moon look the same size; they are not. The stars seem to move around the earth; they do not. Learning the truth requires that we see the world from outside our senses – this does not mean a rejection of our senses, but an airtight compliance with the *real* evidence of the senses, which is not that the world is flat, but that matter, energy and physical laws are consistent. When we let go of a rock in our hand, it falls – this is the *real* evidence of the senses, not that the Earth is fixed and immovable. The idea that the world is immobile is an incorrect assumption that contradicts the direct evidence of our senses, which is that everything falls. If everything falls, the world cannot be fixed and immovable.

These are the little truths of the everyday; that rocks fall, smoke rises, fire is hot and the sun and the moon are both round. If we remain steadfastly and rigorously committed to these “little truths,” we can in time derive the great truths of physics, which provide us such awesome knowledge and power.

In between the little truths and the great truths, however, are the illusions that blind us – both in physics and in ethics.

In physics, the great truths cannot contradict the little truths. No “unified field theory” can validly contradict our direct sense-experience of a falling rock or a rising flame. The greatest mathematical theory cannot be valid if applying it returns incorrect change at the checkout counter.

Historically, however, in between our own little truths and the great truths lies what I will call the “null zone.”

### The "Null Zone"

We tell our children not to punch each other, and we believe that violence is wrong in the abstract, as a general moral rule. The “little truth” is: *don’t punch*. The “great truth” is: *violence is wrong*.

However, there exists in our minds an imaginary entity called “God,” and this entity is considered perfectly moral. Unfortunately, this entity continually and grossly violates the edict that “violence is wrong” by drowning the world, consigning souls to hell despite a perfect foreknowledge of their “decisions,” sanctioning rape, murder, theft, assault and other actions that we would condemn as utterly evil in any individual.

Thus we have the little truth (*don’t punch*) and the great truth (*violence is wrong*) but in the middle, we have this “null zone” *where the complete opposite of both our little truths and our great truths is considered perfectly true*.

Historically, we can see the same inconsistency in physics. There are no perfect circles in our direct experience, but because of a belief in God, all planetary motion had to be a “perfect circle” – a premise that retarded astronomy for centuries. Similarly, if a man turns his head, he does not reasonably believe that the entire world rotates around him – and he would happily put this forward as not just his own “little truth,” but as a *great truth*, or universal principle. Yet for most of human history, it was believed that the stars and planets rotated around the Earth, rather than that the Earth rotated. Here again we can see the “null zone” between direct sense experience and universal principle, wherein entirely opposite principles are considered to be perfectly valid.

No sane man experiences God directly. In his daily life, he fully accepts that *that which cannot be perceived does not exist*. No reasonable man flinches every time he takes a step, fearing an invisible wall that might be barring his way. The greatest abstractions of science support his approach.

Conversely, in the “null zone” of religion, the *exact opposite* of both the little truths and the great truths is believed to be true. Personally, a man believes that *that which cannot be perceived does not exist* – intellectually, science has proven this repeatedly. However, in the “null zone” of theology, the exact opposite proposition holds true – the axiom there is *that which cannot be perceived **must** exist*.

Our belief in the virtue of the military also lies in this “null zone.” If a private man is paid to murder another man, we call him a “gun for hire,” and condemn him as a hit man. If, however, this man puts on a green costume with certain ribbons *and commits the same act*, we hail him as a hero and reward him with a pension. The little truth (*I should not murder*) is perfectly consistent with the great truth (*murder is wrong*) – yet in the middle there lies a “null zone,” where murder magically becomes “virtuous.”

If this “null zone” is valid, then no logical proposition can ever hold. If a proposition is true – and the exact opposite of that proposition is also true – then logical reasoning becomes impossible. The growth of rational science has been the steady attack upon this “null zone,” and the incursion of objective consistency into these mad little pockets of subjective whim.

In old maps, before cartographers had finished their explorations, the drawings of known lands would fade into blank paper. The growth of knowledge requires first a delineation of what is not known, and then an expansion of known principles into the unknown areas.

在道德领域也是如此。

### 伤亡者

跨越这个“零地域”充满了危险。 小道理通往大真理的道路是由百万骨头堆砌而成的。 从苏格拉底之死到宗教狂热者对早期科学家的酷刑，再到数以百万计的人被谋杀、为法西斯主义和共产主义的黑色幻想而献身的人，任何人类知识的向前推动进入“零地域”都充满了相当大的危险。

“跨越零地域”—或将小道理和大真题无缝结合—必然是如此困难和危险吗？ 把感性和概念统一在同一逻辑推理上是一个巨大的挑战—但是，这一过程*必然要*花上千年万载、付出巨大代价吗？

如果我们看看人类的技术进步和经济发展，几乎我们看到的是一个数以千年的沿水平发展线，随后过去几百年里的发展出现了大规模而渐近剧增。 令人难以置信的事，一些普遍的基因突变可以解释知识一致性和物质成就的突如其来和巨大加速。 理论中声称某种“雪球效应”的产生，是由于自文明诞生以来产生的所有知识小增量的积累而神秘地推动，通常可以被完全排除在*事后解释*，因为它们没有预测价值。

如果我们知道惊人的潜力已经在我们身上存在了至少几万年—而且练习它会有巨大的利润和巨大的乐趣—那么很明显我们真的*想*使用我们惊人的心智。

于是，必然有一种下行力，它在历史上的作用是粉碎和奴役人类的天赋自由权。

在科学领域，不难看到能让我们心智持续处于近乎原始矇昧的压抑力。 以宗教形式的迷信和以贵族形式的暴力相结合，用恐吓、监禁、酷刑和谋杀威胁理性思想家。 正如农民从他的牛的低智力中获利一样，奴隶主从奴隶的恐惧中获利，神父和国王对任何敢思考的人进行死亡威胁来保留他们的特权。

简单的事实是，“神父”和“国王”曾是—现在是—而且仅仅是男人。简单的事实是，上帝和魔鬼从未存在过，但他们理应为他们的统治辩护。

我们在理解人类平等的本质和现实上取得了长足进步，但令人悲哀的事实是，*道理*领域仍迷失在“零区域”—是对“中间真理”的破坏性幻想。

### “中间真理”

Let us call the oppositional principles that reside in the “null zone” – between sense perception and conceptual consistency – the “middle truths.”

这些“中间真理”是所有人中最危险的幻想，因为他们承认真相的*出现*，同时竟*攻击*真相。

通过提供我们已经找到的真相的幻觉，实际上“中间真理”却阻止我们获得真相。它们是幻想、掠夺和剥削的最后一道防线。

因为它们不仅是非理性的，而且是*反*理性的，“中间真理”仍然是无限灵活的—只要它们为掌权者服务。 例如，基督教产生的部分原因是因为通过抨击已有神学的“原始”迷信使得罗马帝国晚期不断增长的法西斯主义。 “忘掉你的旧神，我们有一个崭新的神，他比旧神好太多了！”

“中间真理”总以真理的形式出现，并紧随着一个谎言。 “宙斯是一个异教徒”是一个真实的陈述，这是基督教徒公开地布道。 紧随其后的谎言是：“耶和华不是一个异教徒，而是一个真正的活生生的神。”

我们可以用一个例子让这更个性化一点，这个例子对于曾被建议需要有一个蹩脚的朋友的任何人来说都很熟悉。 她说，“我上一个男友真是个混蛋，”你会很强烈地表示赞同。 她补充说到，“但是我的新男友真的很*好*，“你试着不去翻白眼。

很难不用一个幻象替代另一个幻象。

在十八世纪，美国革命者哭喊着“英国政府实施暴政！”—在驱赶英国军队后，他们建立了自己的政府，开始攻击他们自己的公民。

其他革命者哭喊道，“贵族是个不公平的可憎之物”，革命者建立起民主形式的多数派专制。

“中间真理”也存在于科学中，类似地从小道理到大真理阻碍了自然的进化。 直到十八世纪，例如生物学家相信“自然发生说”，或是认为生命起源于无生命物质。 当然，这一点从未被观察过，但这符合哲学和宗教的古老文献，因此作为事实被接受。 另外，在1905年爱因斯坦革命之前，大家认为光是通过一个固定而无形的物质“以太”来移动的，正如音波是通过空气来移动的。 相信此理论的科学家没有实验证明，也没有亲身体会或是科学证据证明“以太”—它被认为有必要遵循其他应遵循的特征。

宗教也是另一个“中间真理”—是最危险的真理之一。 据我们所知，我们的确是宇宙中独一无二的物种。 长颈鹿是更高的四足动物，但是，人类不仅是“更聪明”的灵长目动物，而且是一种完全不同的动物。 这种差异的本质在很大程度上仍然是未知的—“我们不同于动物，是因为我们有灵魂，上帝创造了我们”的宗教解释是另一个“中间真理”的例子。我们的确与动物很不一样。 我们由上帝创造，我们有灵魂，那都不是真的。

正如一些寄生虫不能扎根，直到它们把已有的寄生虫驱逐，“中间真理”仅攻击先前的幻想*以便它们能取代先前幻想的地位*。 那些对先前幻想持怀疑态度的人，被新的幻想所吸引。 就这样，基督教取代了信奉异教，马克思主义取代基督教，后现代主义取代马克思主义，民主国家取代贵族统治的国家，等等。

直到获得伟大的真理，并将伟大的真理与小道理相结合，“中间真理”只是一个具有掠夺性、破坏性的谎言，正如一个可旋转的方阵—专门设计用来防止获知伟大的真理。

伟大的真理总是从小道理中获得。

世界崩塌是因为岩石崩塌了。

### "Middle Truths" And Exploitation

从生物学上来说，寄生对于许多生物来说是一个完全可行的生存策略。 在缺乏伦理规范的情况下，窃取其他生物的能量和资源是非常明智的。 通常来说，最持久、最稳定的寄生形式是*共生*，或互利共存。 因此栖息于我们肠道内的细菌帮助我们消化食物来帮助它们自己的生存。

然而，使我们不断枯竭的、不能维持我们生命的病毒不能被称为“互利”。如果我们思考我们漫长而严酷的灾难、饥饿、战争、疾病和贫穷的历史—将它与现代惊人的物质成就相对比—几千年来，很显然一种寄生形式统治着我们的思想和能力。 在过去的几百年里，人类精神的力量和创造力已经显现出来，我们可以把我们的物种视作为一个摆脱了可怕的寄生虫的有机体，它来自于临终之时无尽的喘气，以表演最惊人的体操技艺。

当我们治愈自己的疾病时，我们会感觉更好，但是疾病并不这样认为。从天花病毒的角度来看，天花病毒种族灭绝了。

同样，扼杀人类的寄生虫带着恐惧看待大多数人的自由。 由于它们的寄生摆脱了现实需求—去获取日常食物—它们不可避免地把大众的自由视为奴役自己的一种形式。 因此，农民会把"解放"他的家畜视作一场灾难吗...

建立真理必然会限制幻想。 限制幻想必然会限制剥削。 如果我能说服你，让你认为我是一个活生生的人神，生下我的神要你给我你收入的百分之十，不然你就会永远被惩罚，那么我会变得非常富有。 我是幻想的寄生物，依赖于这些幻想来维持我的营养，就像是真菌依靠温暖、潮湿—和黑暗。

Those who use moral fantasies to exploit mankind have always fought tooth and nail against those who threaten their livelihood by discovering and disseminating the truth.

We are familiar with the example of the Mafia, which threatens potential rivals with maiming and death, or the spectacle of religious sects attacking each other, or one government attacking another.

When philosophers expose the falsehoods necessary for continued exploitation, however, they are ideally not aiming to set themselves up as competitors. They do not wish to *replace* the Mafia, or the church – they wish to eliminate it completely.

A more modern analogy would be the relationship between the state, lobbyists and taxpayers. Lobbyists will ferociously attack other lobbyists who compete for the same tax dollars. However, imagine how *all* lobbyists would band together to attack anyone who proposed eliminating the state as an institution.

Parasites will aggressively compete with one another for the host’s limited resources – but it is in their best interest to band together to attack anything that threatens to eliminate the host itself.

In this way, in any society where the state and the church are nominally separated, each entity tends to compete for adherents. Where the church begins to lose ground, the state will aggressively recruit patriots – resulting in secular socialism. Where the state begins to lose ground, the church will aggressively recruit adherents – resulting in religious fundamentalism, often with tinges of libertarianism.

However, the philosophers who oppose *all* intellectual error are the sworn enemies of all the parasites that feed off illusions. The “great truths” of physics eliminate the need for supernatural agents, and render miracles impossible. The explanatory power of science wholly outshines the religious fictions that masquerade as knowledge about the physical world.

The scientific method requires that every thesis be supported by evidence and rationality. Since there is no evidence for gods – and the very *idea* of gods is innately self-contradictory – the thesis “gods exist” cannot stand. Inevitably, the religious parasites attempt to defend their thesis by trying to split reality into “two realms” – the scientific and the spiritual. However, there is no evidence for the existence of this “spiritual” realm in the present, any more than there was for the parallel universe of Platonic “Forms” two thousand five hundred years ago.

Thus the establishment of consistent and universal truth necessarily limits and destroys the exploitive potential of illusion. In particular, the “great truths,” which are universal and consistent, make redundant and ridiculous the “middle truths” – which are in fact exploitive fantasies. We are familiar with the “middle truth” of religion; a few others will be examined and revealed here, some of which may shock you.

### Effective Parasitism

The most effective parasites – or viruses – are those which fool the body into indifference. Our immune systems are designed to attack foreign substances within the body, isolating and killing them. We fear HIV and cancer in particular because they are able to bypass our immune systems. The same technique is used by intellectual parasites to disable the defence systems of those they prey upon.

If a stranger attacks you in an alley and demands your money, you will be horrified and appalled. You may fight back, you may run, or you may give him your wallet, but you would remain shocked, angry and frightened by the interaction. When you repeated the story, you would tell it in a way that reinforced the base and vile violation of your personal and property rights. Others would feel sympathy for your predicament, and would avoid said alley in the future.

This is an example of a “little truth,” which is: “Stealing from me is wrong.”

However, when a government agent sends you a letter demanding that you pay him money, you may feel a certain indignity, but you would not relate the story with the same horror and indignation to your friends.

This is an example of a “middle truth,” which obscures a “great truth,” which is that “stealing is wrong.”

This book will focus on exposing and destroying these false “middle truths.” I believe that mankind suffers endlessly under the tyranny of false ethical “middle truths” which justify the destructive world-views of religious superstition, secular despotism and the cult of the family.

My thesis in this book is that in ethics, as in every other intellectual discipline, the great truths arise directly from the little truths. The disorienting fog of the “middle truths” is a hellish path to navigate, but it is worth struggling through, because the only fundamental alternative to truth is exploitation, destruction – and, inevitably, the untimely demise of millions.
