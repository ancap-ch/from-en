## 引言

历经无数个世代，人类生活在一种自我矇昧的以自我为中心的摇篮里：地球是平的，月亮和星星围绕着人转，祖先从死亡的迷雾中向人召唤，雷声是众神的愤怒。

人们挖掘这个富有主观解释的自我崇拜的摇篮需要几千年的劳动，并且要付出数百万人的生命作为代价。 要把我们的视角从*知觉经验*转向*逻辑概念*所做的努力是可怕的，令人兴奋的，会让人非常迷茫，也极具危险。 理解世界并不是*感觉*它是什么，也不是*好像*它是什么，理解世界是—依然是—人类智慧最大的壮举。 现实的*真相*在心灵的慧眼里，而不在肉眼里。

地球看起来是平的，其实并不是。 太阳和月亮看起来大小一样，其实它们大小不一样。 星星好像围绕着地球转；其实并不是。 认识真理需要我们置于我们感官之外来看世界—这并不意味着否认我们的感官，而是严密的遵循感官的*真实*依据，这一依据不是地球是平的，而是物质，能量和物理定理的一致性。 当我们放开手中的石头，它掉下来了—这是感官*真实的*依据，而不是地球是固定不变的。 认为世界是静止的这一观点是错误的假设，它与我们感官的直接证据相矛盾，即一切事物都会坠落。 如果一切事物都会坠落，世界就无法固定不变。

这些都是日常的小道理：岩石坠落，烟雾升起，火是热的，太阳和月亮都是圆的。 如果我们继续坚定严格地致力于这些“小真理”，我们迟早都能推导出物理学的伟大真理，它为我们提供了令人如此敬畏的知识和力量。

然而，在小道理和伟大真理之间存在着蒙蔽我们的幻象—无论是在物理学里还是伦理学里都是这样。

在物理学中，伟大真理不能与小道理相矛盾。 没有“统一场理论”能有效地反驳我们对岩石坠落或火焰上升的直接的感觉经验。 把最伟大的数学理论应用于收银台中错误的退还零钱是没有效的。

然而，历史上在我们所拥有的小道理和伟大真理之间存在着我称之为的“零地域”。

### “零地域”

我们告诉我们的孩子不要相互攻击，并把它作为一个普世的道德准则，我们认为从理论上来说暴力是错误的。 “小道理”是：*不要攻击*。 “大真理”是：*暴力是错误的*。

然而，在我们的头脑中存在着一个被称为“上帝”的虚构实体，这个实体被认为是完全合乎道德的。 这个实体淹没世界，尽管他们做了完美又有先见之明的决定，但让灵魂下了地狱，制裁强奸，谋杀，盗窃，打架斗殴等行为，这些行为我们都会谴责为绝对邪恶，不幸的是，这个实体不断严重地违反“暴力是错误的”这一法令。

因此，在我们有的“小道理”（*不要攻击*）和“大真理”（*暴力是错误的*）的中间，我们有的这个“零地域”*被认为是完全正确的，它与小道理和大真理是完全对立的*。

从历史角度看，我们可以在物理学中看见相同的矛盾。 在我们的直接经验中没有完美的圆周运动，但是由于对上帝的信仰，所有的行星运动都必须是一个“完美的圆周运动”—这一前提阻碍了天文学发展长达几个世纪。 同样地，如果一个人转动他的头，他就没有理由相信：整个世界围绕着他转—他会很高兴地把这往前推进，不只是作为他的“小道理”，而是作为一个*大真理*，或是普世原则。 然而，在人类历史大部分时间里，人们相信恒星和行星围绕着地球旋转，而不是地球围绕恒星和行星旋转。 我们能在直接经验和普世原则之间看到“零地域”，其中完全对立的原则被认为是完全有效的。

理智的人不能直接感受到上帝的存在。 在他的日常生活中，他完全接受*无法感知的就不存在*。 没有理智的人无论何时每走一步他都会畏惧，害怕无形的墙可能会阻拦他的路。 科学最伟大的抽象概念支持他的方法。

相反地，在宗教的“零地域”中，小道理和大真理的*对立面*被认为是真的。 就个人而言，一个人相信*无法感知的就不存在*—就学术上而言，科学已经反复证明了这一点。 然而，在神学的“零地域”中，完全相反的命题是正确的—有个公理是*不能被感知到的**必然**存在*。

我们对军事美德的信仰也在于这个“零地域”。如果一个有秘密的人被雇佣去杀害另一个人，我们称他为“雇用枪”，谴责他为职业杀手。 然而，如果这个人穿上绿色的服装戴上特定的丝带，*犯下同样错误*，我们会称赞他为英雄，给他养老金。 小道理（*我不应该杀人*）和大真理（*杀人是错误的*）完全契合—然而在中间有一个“零地域”，在“零地域”里谋杀神奇地变成了“有道理的”。

如果这个“零地域”是有效的，那么没有逻辑命题可以保持不变。 如果一个命题是真的—这个命题的对立面也是真的—那么逻辑推理就变得不可能了。 理性科学的发展是对“零地域”的稳步抨击，也是客观一致性侵入了这些主观幻想的疯狂小口袋。

制图者完成了他们的探索以前，旧地图上对已知大陆的绘制可能会褪色成白纸。 知识的增长首先需要对未知事物做一个划分，然后将已知原则扩展到未知领域。

在道德领域也是如此。

### The Casualties

跨越这个“零地域”充满了危险。 小道理通往大真理的道路是由百万骨头堆砌而成的。 从苏格拉底之死到宗教狂热者对早期科学家的酷刑，再到数以百万计的人被谋杀、为法西斯主义和共产主义的黑色幻想而献身的人，任何人类知识的向前推动进入“零地域”都充满了相当大的危险。

“跨越零地域”—或将小道理和大真题无缝结合—必然是如此困难和危险吗？ 把感性和概念统一在同一逻辑推理上是一个巨大的挑战—但是，这一过程*必然要*花上千年万载、付出巨大代价吗？

If we look at the technological and economic progress of mankind, we see more or less a flat line for countless millennia, followed by massive and asymptotic spikes over the past few hundred years. It is inconceivable that some widespread genetic mutation could account for this sudden and enormous acceleration of intellectual consistency and material success. Theories claiming that a certain “snowball effect” came into existence, mysteriously propelled by an accumulation of all the little increments of knowledge that had occurred since the dawn of civilisation, can usually be dismissed out of hand as entirely *ex post facto* explanations, since they have no predictive value.

If we understand that our staggering potential has been available to us for at least tens of thousands of years – and that there is both great profit and great pleasure in exercising it – then it at once becomes clear that we really *do* want to use our amazing minds.

Thus there must be a downward force that has historically acted to crush and enslave the natural liberty of mankind.

In the realm of science, it is not too hard to see the oppressive forces that continually kept our minds in near-primeval ignorance. The combination of superstition in the form of religion, and violence in the form of the aristocracy, threatened rational thinkers with intimidation, imprisonment, torture, and murder. Just as a farmer profits from the low intelligence of his cows, and a slave-owner profits from the fear of his slaves, priests and kings retained their privileges by threatening with death anyone who dared to think.

The simple truth is that “priests” and “kings” were – and are – merely men. The simple truth is that the gods and devils that were supposed to justify their rule never existed.

We have made great strides in understanding the nature and reality of simple human equality, but the sad fact of the matter is that the realm of *morality* is still lost in the “null zone” – in the destructive illusions of the “middle truths.”

### "Middle Truths"

Let us call the oppositional principles that reside in the “null zone” – between sense perception and conceptual consistency – the “middle truths.”

These “middle truths” are the most dangerous illusions of all, because they grant the *appearance* of truth while actually *attacking* the truth.

By providing the illusion that we have found the truth, “middle truths” actually prevent us from gaining the truth. They are the last line of defence for fantasy, predation and exploitation.

Since they are not only irrational, but *anti*-rational, “middle truths” remain endlessly flexible – as long as they serve those in power. For instance, Christianity arose out of the growing fascism of the late Roman Empire partly by lashing out at the “primitive” superstitions of existing theologies. “Forget your old gods, we have a brand new God who is far better!”

“Middle truths” always take the form of a truth, followed by a lie. “Zeus is a pagan superstition” is a true statement, which was openly made by Christian proselytisers. The lie that followed was: “Yahweh is not a pagan superstition, but a real and living God.”

We can personalise this a little bit more with an example that will be familiar to anyone who has ever counselled a dysfunctional friend. “My last boyfriend was a real jerk,” she will say, and you will fervently agree. “My new boyfriend is really *great* though,” she will add, and you will try not to roll your eyes.

It is very hard not to replace one illusion with another.

“The British government is a tyranny!” cried the American revolutionaries in the eighteenth century – and, after evicting the British troops, they then set up their own government and started attacking their own citizens.

“Aristocracy is an unjust abomination!” cried other revolutionaries, who then set up the tyranny of the majority in the form of democracy.

“Middle truths” can also exist in science, and similarly prevent the natural progress from the little truths to the great truths. Until the eighteenth century, for instance, biologists believed in “spontaneous generation,” or the idea that life can spring from nonliving matter. This had never been observed, of course, but conformed to ancient writings both philosophical and religious, and so was accepted as fact. Also, prior to the Einsteinian revolution in 1905, light was believed to move through a fixed and invisible substance called “luminiferous ether,” just as sound waves move through air. No scientist who believed in this theory had any empirical evidence for this “ether,” either personally or scientifically – but it was considered necessary to conform to other observable characteristics.

Religion is also another “middle truth” – one of the most dangerous ones. It is true that we are a unique species in the universe, as far as we know. A giraffe is a taller quadruped, but man is not just a “smarter” primate, but something quite different. The nature of that difference remains largely unknown – the religious explanation of “we are not the same as animals because we have a soul and were created by a God” is just another example of a “middle truth.” It is true that we are very different from animals. It is not true that we were created by a god and have a soul.

Just as some parasites cannot take root until they dislodge the prior parasites, “middle truths” only attack previous illusions *so that they can take their place*. Those who are sceptical of the prior fantasies are drawn towards the new fantasy. Thus does Christianity displace paganism, Marxism displace Christianity, post-modernism displace Marxism, democracy displace aristocracy, and so on.

Until the great truths are achieved, and united with the little truths, “middle truths” are just a rotating phalanx of exploitive and destructive falsehoods – specifically designed to prevent the achievement of the great truths.

And the great truths are always achieved from the little truths.

The world falls because a rock falls.

### "Middle Truths" And Exploitation

Biologically, parasitism is a wholly viable survival strategy for many creatures. In the absence of ethical norms, stealing energy and resources from other creatures is perfectly sensible. In general, the most sustainable and stable form of parasitism is *symbiosis*, or mutually beneficial coexistence. Thus the bacteria that inhabit our intestines aid their own survival by helping us digest our food.

However, a virus that renders us continually exhausted, and barely able to keep ourselves alive, can scarcely be called “mutually beneficial.” If we think of our long and grim history of disaster, starvation, war, disease and poverty – and compare it with the astounding material successes of modernity – it is clear that a form of parasitism tyrannised our minds and capacities for millennia. Now that the last few hundred years have shown the power and creativity of the human spirit, we can view our species as an organism that has shaken off a terrible parasite, and sprung from an endless gasping deathbed to perform the most astounding feats of gymnastics.

When we cure ourselves of a disease, we feel better, but the disease does not. From the perspective of the smallpox virus, the smallpox vaccine is genocidal.

In the same way, the parasites that strangle mankind view the liberty of the majority with horror. Since their parasitism frees them from the demands of reality – to earn their daily bread – they inevitably view the freedom of the masses as a form of enslavement for themselves. Thus would a farmer view the “liberation” of his livestock as an utter disaster…

Establishing truth necessarily limits fantasy. Limiting fantasy necessarily limits exploitation. If I can convince you that I am a living man-God, and that the God who birthed me wants you to give me ten percent of your income, or you will be punished for eternity, then I can become exceedingly rich. I am a parasite of illusions, and depend on those illusions for my sustenance as surely as fungus relies on warmth, dampness – and darkness.

Those who use moral fantasies to exploit mankind have always fought tooth and nail against those who threaten their livelihood by discovering and disseminating the truth.

We are familiar with the example of the Mafia, which threatens potential rivals with maiming and death, or the spectacle of religious sects attacking each other, or one government attacking another.

When philosophers expose the falsehoods necessary for continued exploitation, however, they are ideally not aiming to set themselves up as competitors. They do not wish to *replace* the Mafia, or the church – they wish to eliminate it completely.

A more modern analogy would be the relationship between the state, lobbyists and taxpayers. Lobbyists will ferociously attack other lobbyists who compete for the same tax dollars. However, imagine how *all* lobbyists would band together to attack anyone who proposed eliminating the state as an institution.

Parasites will aggressively compete with one another for the host’s limited resources – but it is in their best interest to band together to attack anything that threatens to eliminate the host itself.

In this way, in any society where the state and the church are nominally separated, each entity tends to compete for adherents. Where the church begins to lose ground, the state will aggressively recruit patriots – resulting in secular socialism. Where the state begins to lose ground, the church will aggressively recruit adherents – resulting in religious fundamentalism, often with tinges of libertarianism.

However, the philosophers who oppose *all* intellectual error are the sworn enemies of all the parasites that feed off illusions. The “great truths” of physics eliminate the need for supernatural agents, and render miracles impossible. The explanatory power of science wholly outshines the religious fictions that masquerade as knowledge about the physical world.

The scientific method requires that every thesis be supported by evidence and rationality. Since there is no evidence for gods – and the very *idea* of gods is innately self-contradictory – the thesis “gods exist” cannot stand. Inevitably, the religious parasites attempt to defend their thesis by trying to split reality into “two realms” – the scientific and the spiritual. However, there is no evidence for the existence of this “spiritual” realm in the present, any more than there was for the parallel universe of Platonic “Forms” two thousand five hundred years ago.

Thus the establishment of consistent and universal truth necessarily limits and destroys the exploitive potential of illusion. In particular, the “great truths,” which are universal and consistent, make redundant and ridiculous the “middle truths” – which are in fact exploitive fantasies. We are familiar with the “middle truth” of religion; a few others will be examined and revealed here, some of which may shock you.

### Effective Parasitism

The most effective parasites – or viruses – are those which fool the body into indifference. Our immune systems are designed to attack foreign substances within the body, isolating and killing them. We fear HIV and cancer in particular because they are able to bypass our immune systems. The same technique is used by intellectual parasites to disable the defence systems of those they prey upon.

If a stranger attacks you in an alley and demands your money, you will be horrified and appalled. You may fight back, you may run, or you may give him your wallet, but you would remain shocked, angry and frightened by the interaction. When you repeated the story, you would tell it in a way that reinforced the base and vile violation of your personal and property rights. Others would feel sympathy for your predicament, and would avoid said alley in the future.

This is an example of a “little truth,” which is: “Stealing from me is wrong.”

However, when a government agent sends you a letter demanding that you pay him money, you may feel a certain indignity, but you would not relate the story with the same horror and indignation to your friends.

This is an example of a “middle truth,” which obscures a “great truth,” which is that “stealing is wrong.”

This book will focus on exposing and destroying these false “middle truths.” I believe that mankind suffers endlessly under the tyranny of false ethical “middle truths” which justify the destructive world-views of religious superstition, secular despotism and the cult of the family.

My thesis in this book is that in ethics, as in every other intellectual discipline, the great truths arise directly from the little truths. The disorienting fog of the “middle truths” is a hellish path to navigate, but it is worth struggling through, because the only fundamental alternative to truth is exploitation, destruction – and, inevitably, the untimely demise of millions.
