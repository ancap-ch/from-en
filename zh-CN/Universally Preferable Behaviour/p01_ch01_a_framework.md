## 道德伦理框架

道德伦理主张不同于其他类型的知识陈述。如果我说，“我喜欢爵士乐”，这可能是一个真实或错误的陈述，但它通常不被视为对你有任何约束力。我对爵士乐的偏爱只是个人喜好的陈述；基于我的陈述，你不必喜欢或不喜欢爵士乐。

同样，如果我说“我喜欢蔬菜”，那也仅仅是个人偏好的陈述。然而，如果我说“蔬菜是健康食品”，那么我已经从个人喜好的陈述转变为客观事实陈述。这就是“我喜欢冰淇淋”和“冰淇淋含有牛奶”的区别。

偏好陈述和事实陈述之间的根本区别在于，事实陈述是客观的、可检验的和有约束力的。如果你重视真理，你有义务接受一个事实，即一旦证明冰淇淋，牛奶就含有牛奶。[^1]

如果我说地球是圆的，我为这个陈述提供了充分的证据，那么就不再由你自己来决定这个陈述是否属实。如果我能证明地球是圆的，那么就不再由你自己来决定这个陈述是否属实，除非你愿意拒绝理性和证据作为真理的标准。

如果我接受数学定律的有效性，我就不能武断地否定符合这些规律的数学证明。如果我拒绝接受这样的证明，我不能再声称接受数学法则的有效性。我接受这些法律意味着我必须接受那些符合这些法律的证据。拒绝符合理性标准的证据是对整个理性标准的拒绝。

科学方法、理性本身和数学规律都是确立命题真理性的客观标准的范例。不是我的观点，二加二等于四，如果你也接受二加二等于四，那么你就不会将自己置于纯粹的意见之外，而是置身于一个理性的事实。

### 客观真相

理解真理本质的一个主要挑战是认识到“真理”并不存在于世界上，就像岩石或树木一样。

“真理”这个概念必然是一个相对的术语，但这并不意味着主观或任意的术语。“健康”这个概念也是一个相对术语 - 我们将“健康”与疾病以及相对健康标准进行比较。对于190岁的人来说，被认为是“健康”的东西几乎不被认为是120岁老人的健康。长寿的定义现在比五百年前大不一样了。

然而，这并不意味着“健康”的概念是完全相对的和主观的。根据任何定义，10岁的白血病死亡是不健康的 - 正如一位二十岁的马拉松选手在任何定义下都是健康的。目前，一个活到九十岁的人在统计上有很长的寿命，但如果医疗技术突然允许我们活到二百岁，这种情况就会改变。

随着我们对“健康”的定义的扩展，它并没有使早期的定义失效，而是扩展了它们。如果医疗技术进步，让九十岁的年轻人赢得马拉松，随着我们对“健康”的定义扩大，它不会使先前的定义无效，而是将其扩展。如果医疗技术进步让90岁的人赢得马拉松，那么我们对老年人健康状况的定义将会改变 - 但这并不意味着这位二十岁的马拉松运动员突然变得不健康了。学习代数不会使算术失效。

真理也与必要性有关。牛顿物理学已由爱因斯坦物理取代，这已被证明在极端情况下，如非常高的重力和速度更准确。然而，希望计算海洋中正确路径的水手们发现牛顿物理学的精确度不够准确。你不会想把飞船用牛顿物理学的半人马座α星，但它是完全可以从Lisbon得到一个去纽约的船。因此，参与学习和实施爱因斯坦物理的劳动力对于水手来说是净负面的。

作为一个结果，一句“牛顿物理学比爱因斯坦物理不太准确，但牛顿物理学是计算船舶路径的最佳方式”这句话可以被认为是一个有效的命题。因此，牛顿物理学既不准确，也更恰当。

如果我们想喝最纯净的水，我们可能会支付几千美元每瓶。除非我们是非常富有和极度轻浮，否则我们永远不会付出太多的代价来解渴。诚然，纯净水对我们更好，但纯度所需的价格达到递减的门槛。因此，“纯粹是更好的“让”更是雪上加霜”。

同样，这并不意味着水的纯度是完全主观的。蒸馏水总是比海水更容易饮用。

#### 真理与客观现实

真理的概念必然涉及精确的概念。如果我试图用靶心射箭，我拍摄的精度是由多远我的箭地从中心。

那么，什么是真相的“牛眼”呢？

一句话的真实性相对于它与客观现实的一致性是可度量的。

撇开语言的挑战的时刻，如果我点对海鸥说，“这是一个铁砧，我显然是错误的，因为砧是无机的，不能飞。我的陈述的真实价值是相对于现实的客观事实来衡量的。因为海鸥实际上不是铁砧，我的说法是不真实的。

当然，真理与现实之间的这个等式要求语言和我们的感官被认为是相对客观的。有很多很好的理由相信，语言和意义的证据是客观的；我们可以进入这个复杂的讨论，但应该说，因为你是用你的眼睛去读写在人类语言的一本书，我们至少可以认为，你的眼睛，和我们的语言份额，至少目的足够你准确地处理我的写作。如果不是，我们没什么好谈的，你还是一点都不明白我写呢，所以这句话也同样毫无意义，而且可能也已呈现“宋体” 。

Assuming you can tell the difference between the above two fonts, we can reasonably continue.

#### Accuracy And Consistency

It is impossible for me to accurately paint a cloud, since in the time it takes to paint it, the cloud continually changes. I can accurately paint a *photograph* of a cloud, which has become frozen in time.

If I spend an hour trying to paint a cloud, and then I ask you whether or not my painting is an accurate representation of that cloud, you must necessarily reply that it is not.

In other words, where there is no consistency, there can be no accuracy.

When we dream at night, our perceptions are that the rules of “matter” and “energy” are in a constant state of flux – we are immune to gravity, and then we fly on the back of an elephant, and then we can walk through walls. It is no more possible to develop a “scientific physics of dreams” than it is to accurately paint a cloud.

Logic, science and truth, then, are impossible in the absence of *consistency*.

Fundamentally, the laws of logic are derived from the behaviour of matter and energy, at least at the perceptual level. If I tell you to throw a ball both up and down at the same time, I am asking for the impossible, which you can easily test by attempting to fulfil my request. If I tell you to plough both the north field and the south field simultaneously, you will be unable to comply. If I demand that you turn a rose into a donkey, my demand will never be met.

Perceptual reality is consistent and objective – and it is from this consistency and objectivity that we derive the laws of logic. Our statements about reality can only accurately *represent* reality as a direct result of this consistency and objectivity.

The fact that seagulls do not arbitrarily turn into anvils – or vice versa – is the root of our capacity to accurately judge the statement: “That is a seagull.” If seagulls spontaneously and continually changed their nature, we would be unable to make either true or false statements regarding them – or anything for that matter.

This is the root of a key criterion of the scientific method – reproducibility. If I make a universal claim about the nature of gravity, then you should be able to reproduce that claim in your own environment. If reality were *not* consistent, then reproducibility would be an irrational criterion for the establishment of truth.

If you were a maths teacher, you would be very unlikely to accept a wrong answer from a student, even if that student claimed that his answer was “right” when he wrote it down, but just somehow changed in the interim.

Thus we can accept that we must measure the validity of a statement relative to objective reality – both empirically, and logically. Logic as a discipline arises only as a result of the consistency of reality; empirical observations are also valid or invalid only as a result of the consistent nature of reality.

### The Existence Of "Truth"

Truth, then, can be measured according to two central criteria:

1. Truth is a measure of the correlation between the ideas in our minds and the consistency of rationality, which is directly derived from the consistent behaviour of matter and energy in the real world.[^2]
2. Truth is also a measure of the correlation between the ideas in our minds and the nature and behaviour of matter and energy in the real world.[^3]

The first criterion is a measure of the consistency of ideas with themselves – and such consistency is a requirement because reality is consistent with itself. If I say, “I do not exist,” that is an example of an idea that is inconsistent with itself, since I must exist in order to utter the sentence. The second criterion is a measure of the accuracy of ideas relative to empirical observations of objective reality.

#### Empiricism Versus Rationality

Empiricism can be thought of as the ability to instinctively catch a thrown ball, or measure its movement; rationality is the ability to predict and understand the path that ball will take based on universal principles. Clearly, if balls randomly went in any and every direction – and magically transformed into flocks of doves to boot – we would be utterly unable to predict their behaviour.

Thus, since matter obeys immutable laws, our theories *about* matter must also obey immutable laws. If I know nothing about baseball, but watch a baseball game where the players always obey the rules, it would be irrational for me to formulate a theory about the rules of baseball that directly contradicted the behaviour of the players I was watching. Since the actions of the players are consistent, *any theory I develop regarding the rules that guide those actions must also be consistent*.

This requirement for consistency is one of the most basic requirements for truth. Since reality is consistent, theories regarding reality must also be consistent.

In fact, the first hurdle that any theory must overcome is that of *internal consistency*.

[^1]: If you do not value truth, you would never be in this debate – or any other debate – in the first place!

[^2]: Rational consistency, or internal logic.

[^3]: Empirical evidence, or empiricism.
