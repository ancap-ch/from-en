## 偏好性

现在我们理解了弄巧成拙的论点的本质，我们可以转向偏好的问题。

偏好是任何定义命题真值的方法论的核心。例如，科学方法主要由对逻辑一致性和实证验证的先天偏好来定义。对科学来说，前提是：如果你想确定一个关于物质和能量行为的有效真理，那么最好用科学的方法。

从这个意义上说，“可取的”并不意味着“更好”，而是“需要”。如果你想活下去，你最好不要吃一把砒霜。如果你想确定关于现实的有效真理，那么你的理论必须是内在一致的和经验可验证的。“普遍优先”则转化为“客观要求”，但我们会保留“优先”来区分人类和非可选可选绝对物理绝对如重力之间。

同样，如果道德理论能够完全有效，那么它们至少必须是内外一致的。换句话说，一个自相矛盾的伦理理论是无效的 - 一个违背经验主义证据和普遍普遍偏好的伦理理论也不能成立。

因此，在道德伦理学中，正如在科学、数学、工程和其他所有将理论与现实相比较的学科中一样，有效的理论必须是逻辑上是一致的和经验可验证的。

### 偏好性与存在性

如果我说“我喜欢冰淇淋”，那句话中只有一个词是模棱两可的。显然“我”存在，因为我表达了个人偏好。同样明显的是，冰淇淋也存在于现实中。然而，“喜欢”这个词更成问题。

偏好在现实中并不客观存在。如果你很好奇，你也许可以跟在我的周围，并记录每次我吃了冰淇淋，这可能会建立我的偏好有提供实证依据。然而，这种可能性可能存在，我实际上是一个受虐狂，并且不喜欢冰激凌，并且喜欢用不愉快的口味来折磨自己– 然后迷惑你说喜欢它。

我们可以找到偏好的证据，我们在现实中找不到自己的偏好。偏好存在于意识和物质之间的关系，正如重力存在于质量体之间的关系一样。

撇开自由意志和决定论这两个具有挑战性的问题，假定一个人在现在做的事情是他或她“喜欢”做的是合理的。如果我起床去上班，显然我宁愿那样做，而不是所有其他的选择。即使我讨厌我的工作，我也很明显地讨厌它，比如说，身无分文。

鉴于人类可以进行各种各样的行动，任何人正在做的事情都是从所有可能的选择中选择出来的。我选择写这本书，而不是说，学探戈。

当我们将这个简单的事实应用于伦理论证时，我们会得出一些非常有趣的结果。

### 偏好性和争论性

记住我们上面的自我挫败的参数分析，我们可以很容易地理解语句的矛盾性：“偏好不存在。鉴于每一个人的行为 - 包括做出哲学陈述 - 是优先于其他可能的行动选择，认为偏好不存在需要一个认为偏好不存在偏好，这是一个自相矛盾的陈述。认为偏好不存在的说法与语言不存在完全相同。这是一个完全自欺欺人的论点。

因为不表达偏好是不可能的，不管是含蓄的还是明确的，任何行为的人都会接受偏好存在的前提。因此，如果不接受偏好的存在，就不可能辩论偏好的存在。

### 偏好性和普遍性

下一个问题就是：偏好纯粹是主观的，还是它们是普遍的?

显然，有些偏好是主观的。音乐爱好、个人爱好、喜爱的文学等等都是主观的和个人的喜好。

当我们试图将某些偏好定义为目标时，就会产生挑战。

摆在我们面前的主张是：一些偏好是否可以是客观的，即普遍的？

当我说一些偏好可能是客观的，我并不意味着所有人都会遵循这些偏好。如果我认为呼吸是一种客观的偏好，我可以很容易地以那些通过自杀而自杀的人为榜样。如果我说吃是客观的偏好，我的论点可以用饥饿和厌食的例子来反驳。

因此，当我谈到普遍的偏好时，我是在谈论人们应该喜欢什么，而不是他们总是喜欢什么。用一个科学的类比，真正了解宇宙，人们应该用科学的方法–这并不意味着他们总是这样做，因为显然数十亿人查阅古代童话故事而不是现代科学的“答案”是没有办法实现的真相，没有科学的宇宙，但人们完全可以自由地将“真理”重新定义为“错误”，并以神秘的废话满足于自己。

同样，如果一个人想治愈感染，他应该服用抗生素，而不是表演阿兹台克舞。因为跳舞不能治愈感染，所以选择服用抗生素而不是跳跳舞是很普遍的。因此，虽然有偶尔的疯子试图通过跳舞来治疗自己，但如果一个人想要自己治好，他必须服用抗生素。

换句话说，如果你想到达山顶，希望它永远不会工作。如果你想知道宇宙的起源，祈祷永远不会给出答案。人们仍然希望和祈祷，但是这并不能使祈祷或祈祷更有效。考虑到这一点，让我们谈谈是否普遍优惠是否有效的问题。

### 争论性和普遍性

If I choose to debate, I have implicitly accepted a wide variety of premises that are worth spending some time to unpack here.

#### Premise 1: We Both Exist

If I choose to debate with you, then I necessarily must accept that we both exist. If believe that I exist, but you do not, then debating makes no sense, and would be the action of a madman. If I were to start arguing with my reflection in a mirror, I should be sedated, not debated.

#### Premise 2: The Senses Have The Capacity For Accuracy

Since human beings cannot communicate psychically, all debates necessarily involve the evidence of the senses. Writing presupposes sight; talking requires hearing; Braille requires touch. Thus any proposition that depends upon the invalidity of the senses automatically self-destructs.

#### Premise 3: Language Has The Capacity For Meaning

Similar to Premise Two, since all arguments require language, any proposition that rests on the premise that language is meaningless is immediately disproven. Using language to argue that language has no meaning is like using a courier to send a message arguing that couriers never deliver messages.

#### Premise 4: Correction Requires Universal Preferences

If you correct me on an error that I have made, you are implicitly accepting the fact that it would be *better* for me to correct my error. Your preference for me to correct my error is not subjective, but objective, and universal.

You don’t say to me: “You should change your opinion to mine because I would prefer it,” but rather: “You should correct your opinion because it is objectively incorrect.” My error does not arise from merely disagreeing with you, but as a result of my deviance from an objective standard of truth. Your argument that I should correct my false opinion rests on the objective value of truth – i.e. that truth is *universally preferable* to error, and that truth is *universally objective*.

#### Premise 5: An Objective Methodology Exists For Separating Truth From Falsehood

If you disagree with me, but I tell you that you must agree with me because I am always right, it is unlikely that you would be satisfied by the rigour of my argument. If you provided good reasons as to why I was wrong, but I just kept repeating that I was right because I am *always* right, our interaction could scarcely be categorised as a debate.

The moment that I provide some sort of objective criterion for determining truth from falsehood, I am accepting that truth is more than a matter of opinion.

This does not necessarily mean that my objective criteria are *logical* – I could refer you to a religious text, for example. However, even if I do so, I am still accepting that the truth is something that is arrived at independent of mere personal assertion – that an objective methodology exists for separating truth from falsehood.

#### Premise 6: Truth Is Better Than Falsehood

If I tell you that the world is flat, and you reply that the world is not flat, but round, then you are implicitly accepting the axiom that truth and falsehood both exist objectively, and that truth is better than falsehood.

If I tell you that I like chocolate ice cream, and you tell me that you like vanilla, it is impossible to “prove” that vanilla is objectively better than chocolate. The moment that you correct me with reference to objective *facts*, you are accepting that objective facts exist, and that objective truth is *universally preferable* to subjective error.

#### Premise 7: Peaceful Debating Is The Best Way To Resolve Disputes

If I tell you that the world is flat, and you pull out a gun and shoot me, this would scarcely be an example of a productive debate. True, our disagreement would have been “resolved” – but because only one of us was left standing at the end.

If you told me in advance that you would deal with any disagreement by shooting me, I would be unlikely to engage in a debate with you. Thus it is clear that any debate relies on the implicit premise that evidence, reason, truth and objectivity are the *universally preferable* methods of resolving disputes between individuals. It would be completely illogical to argue that differences of opinion should be resolved through the use of violence – the only consistent argument for the *value* of violence is the use of violence.[^4]

In essence, then, debating requires an objective methodology, through meaningful language, in the pursuit of universal truth, which is objectively preferable to personal error.

This preference for universal truth is not a preference of *degree*, but of *kind*. A shortcut that reduces your driving time by half is twice as good as a longer route – but both are *infinitely preferable* to driving in the completely wrong direction.

In the same way, the truth is not just “better” than error – it is *infinitely preferable*, or required.

#### Premise 8: Individuals Are Responsible For Their Actions

If I argue that human beings are not responsible for their actions, I am caught in a paradox, which is the question of *whether or not I am responsible for my argument, and also whether or not you are responsible for your response*.

If my argument that human beings are *not* responsible for their actions is true, then I am not responsible for my argument, and you are not responsible for your reply. However, if I believe that you are not responsible for your reply, it would make precious little sense to advance an argument – it would be exactly the same as arguing with a television set.[^5]

Thus, fundamentally, if I tell you that you are not responsible for your actions, I am telling you that it is universally preferable for you to believe that preference is impossible, since if you have no control over your actions, you cannot choose a preferred state, i.e. truth over falsehood. Thus this argument, like the above arguments, self-destructs.

[^4]: It will be useful to keep this particular premise in mind, since it will be very important later on.

[^5]: The question of responsibility is, of course, closely related to the question of free will versus determinism, which will be the subject of another book.
