## 存在与非存在性

我们将“不存在”定义为不具有质量或能量，或显示质量或能量的影响，如重力可察觉的关系。

上帝不拥有物质或能量，也不显示物质或能量的影响 -无论是通过感官，还是通过理性，上帝实际上都无法以任何方式，形状或形式检测或验证。

因此，如果我说，“上帝存在”，我真正说的是：

“存在的东西必须是可察觉的；上帝是不可察觉的，但上帝存在 - 因此不存在的存在”。

换句话说，通过说“上帝存在”，我创造了一个不可逾越的矛盾。我把“存在”定义为“不存在”，这与“将生命定义为”无生命的物质“或将岩石定义为”与岩石相反“或”方块“定义为”圈”。 

同样，如果我创建了一些备用的宇宙在“非存在等于存在”和“矛盾等于一致性”和“真理与谬误”和“非理性与理性，那么我真的做的是创建一个领域称为“错误，“把一切都是不真实的，并定义了这个领域的一地方“误差等于真理”。[^2]

当然，人们不会创造这个“交替的宇宙”，以使我们自己的宇宙中的真理失效，而是拯救现实中错误的东西，并称之为真。例如，没有人争辩说“上帝可能存在于另一个宇宙，所以你不能声称上帝不存在” 曾争论过, “我可能不存在于另一个宇宙，所以你不能声称我存在于此”。

他们也倾向于对“另一个宇宙，你可能同意我认为上帝不存在，所以你成为无神论者” 的论点作出回应。[^3]

如果现实有效的陈述可以无休止地反对, 因为一些虚构的境界称为“误差等于真理”无效，那么真正被说的是“没有关于真理的正面陈述可以是有效的” -然而，我们作为哲学家聪明现在知道这个说法是自相矛盾的，因为它是一个积极的陈述被认为是真的，说没有积极的陈述是真实的。如果没有什么是真的或假的，甚至是那句话，那么任何事情都不能说任何话。使用词汇，使用英语，使用可理解的句子 -这一切都毫无意义，因为在这个“另类宇宙”中，这种结构化的话语完全是一派胡言。如果在这个交替的宇宙中，真实的事物对我们在这个宇宙中所作的陈述有影响，那么显然相反也是如此，这意味着对于任何事物都不可能做出任何陈述，因为它们的完全相反也同样如此。

该声明“误差等于真理”的真实的现实是“零等于零”的重言式的疯狂。

### 人类社会的“交替宇宙”

我们花这么多时间来处理这个“交替宇宙”理论的原因是它与人类社会有直接的关系，用来证明我们之间所犯下的最大的罪恶。

根据我们个人的经验，我们知道谋杀是错误的。在上述例子中的命题，谋杀在道德上是不对的，我强烈怀疑任何人都有自己的道德本能通过UPB严格的抽象推理证实震惊。然而，在这一部分，你正式允许开始真正震惊。

科学认识上最大的飞跃是所谓的“统一理论”。爱因斯坦花了几十年的时间试图建立一个统一的场论; 而把强、弱力、电磁力、重力等综合起来的物理学理论仍然是难以捉摸的。

然而，UPB为框架，不仅证明了我们的道德本能在个人, 哲学和普遍层面上的道德本能 - 同时也对人类社会产生了深远而令人震惊的影响。

#### UPB行动

UPB框架验证道德命题要求他们是内在一致的，地点和个人方面具有普遍性来验证道德主张。

如果我们接受UPB，我们也必须接受以下推论：

•道德主张与服装无关。

这意味着一个人不能改变他的道德本性和他的衣着。改变服装的行为不会改变人的本性。因此，反对的道德规则不能基于一个人穿的衣服而有效。

当然，士兵们穿的服装与一般公民不同。普通公民被禁止谋杀；然而，士兵不仅被允许谋杀，而且在道德上被认为谋杀。

让我们再举一个例子。

正如我们在上面看到的那样，偷窃在道德上是错误的。在任何情况下，在任何情况下，所有人的道德上都是错误的。既然偷窃是不经同意强行剥夺他人财产的行为，那么税收永远是普遍的、永远的道德败坏。税收根据定义是在未经其同意的情况下强行拆除某人的财产，因为税收依赖于开始使用武力剥夺他的财产。

我们所谓的“政府”不过是这个空白地带的另一个例子，上面是向下的，其中黑色是白色，真实是虚假和邪恶是好的。

社会进步到了理性和证据从个人到普遍的飞跃，并摧毁了任何不合理的空白地带。科学的进步正是在一定程度上它拒绝神和主观的“绝对”不合理。医药的发展完全的程度，它拒绝祈祷和空洞的仪式的效果，而不是依赖的理由和证据。哲学 - 也就是整个人类社会 - 将完全推进到拒绝国家主义和宗教伦理理论的不合理的“方圆道德”的程度。

### 政府

他说政府相反的道德规则从其他社会下运作是完全一样，就像说“妖精免疫重力”。首先，妖精不存在–和的一种方法 - 我们知道他们的行为方式之一不存在的是它声称它们不受重力的影响。 First of all, leprechauns do not exist – and one of the ways in which we know that they do not exist is that it is claimed that they are immune to gravity. Everything that has mass is subject to gravity – that which is immune to gravity by definition does not have mass, and therefore does not exist. The statement “leprechauns are immune to gravity” is a tautology, which only confirms the non-existence of leprechauns – it is the semantic equivalent of “that which does not exist, does not exist.” A is A, Aristotle’s first law of logic, does precious little to confirm the existence of that which is defined as non-existence.

In the same way, when we say that it is morally good for soldiers to murder and government representatives to steal, we know that “soldiers” and “government representatives” as moral categories are *completely invalid*.

If I say that a square circle has the right to steal, I am merely saying that that which cannot exist has the right to do that which is self-contradictory – a purely nonsensical statement, but one which remains strangely compelling in the “null zone” of politics.

If I buy a soldier’s costume at a second hand store, and put it on, clearly I have not created an alternative universe wherein opposite moral rules can be valid. The moment before I put the costume on, it was wrong for me to murder – when does it become *right* for me to murder? When I put on the trousers? What if I have the trousers on, but not the vest? What if I have only one boot on? What about if both boots are on, but only one is laced? What if my hat is on backwards? What if I have put on a uniform that is not recognised by the first person I come across? Did the Beatles suddenly possess the right to murder when they shot the cover for “Sergeant Peppers”? Did they lose that right when they took off their jackets?

I ask these rhetorical questions because they are in fact deadly serious. Clearly, a military costume does not change the nature of a human being, any more than a haircut turns him into a duck, a concept, or a god.

“Ah,” you may say, “but the costume is invalid because you got it at a second hand store – putting on the uniform of the soldier no more makes you a soldier than photocopying a doctorate gives you a Ph.D.”

The analogy is incorrect, because having a Ph.D. or photocopying a doctorate does not change any of the moral rules that you are subjected to as a human being.

“Well,” you may reply, “but the difference is that the soldier possesses moral rights that are provided to him by the average citizen, for the sake of collective self-defence and so on.”

This raises a very interesting point, which is the question of whether opinions can change reality.

### Opinions And Reality

Clearly, we understand that I cannot through my opinion release you from the restraints of gravity, any more than my opinion that “two plus two equals five” makes it true.

“Opinions” are those beliefs which have no clear evidence in reality, or for which no clear evidence can be provided, or which are expressions of merely personal preferences. My personal opinion is that I prefer chocolate ice cream to vanilla – I may also have an “opinion” that Iceland is a tropical paradise, or that God exists, or that rain falls upward. Personal opinions clearly have nothing to do with morality; opinions that claim to accurately describe reality, but which do not, are merely incorrect prejudices. Believing that the rain falls upward does not reverse its course; wearing a Hawaiian shirt to Iceland does not make Reykjavik any warmer.

Thus believing that murder is morally good does not make murder morally good. Since my beliefs about a human being do not change his moral nature, my belief that his murders are virtuous does not change the virtue of his actions. If I close my eyes and imagine that you are a lizard, you do not suddenly lose your ability to regulate your own body temperature. Imagining that you are a fish does not bypass your need for scuba gear.

Opinions do not change reality.

Because opinions do not change reality, I cannot grant you any exception or reversal with regards to a universal moral rule. Since moral rules are based on universal logic, as well as the physical nature and reality of a human being, I cannot grant you the “right to murder,” any more than I can grant you the ability to levitate, walk on water or accurately say that two and two make five.

### Government As Voluntarism

The open force involved in the institution of government – the conceptual wrapper that reverses moral rules for a particular group of individuals – is something that is always kept off the table in debates. When talking about government, it is never considered a positive thing to point out “the gun in the room.” Almost by definition, governments are considered to be chosen by and for the people, and to operate with their expressed or implicit approval.

However, this is pure nonsense.

If a man holds a knife to a woman’s throat while having sex with her, that is by any definition an act of rape. He cannot say that the sex is consensual, while at the same time threatening her with injury or death if she refuses to have sex with him. If the sex is voluntary, then the knife is completely unnecessary. If the man feels the need for a knife, then clearly the sex is *not* voluntary.

In the same way, people say that taxation is part of the social contract that they have voluntarily agreed to.

This is both logically and empirically false.

We know that it is empirically false because *no social contract exists*. Neither you nor I *ever* signed a document voluntarily consenting to the income tax – we were simply born into a system that takes our money from us at the point of a gun.

### The Gun In The Room

Many people will argue at this point that taxation is not enforced at the point of a gun, but rather that people pay it voluntarily. For instance, I have never had a gun pointed in my face by a tax collector or a policeman, but I have paid taxes for decades.

This may be true, but it is completely irrelevant. If I tell a woman that I will kill her children if she does not have sex with me, and she submits herself to me, we clearly understand that an immoral action has taken place – even though I have used no weapon in my violation. Clearly, if the woman submits to me, it is because she fears that I will carry out my threat. If I told her that my pet leprechaun will kill her children if she does not have sex with me, she would very likely be disturbed, but would not fear my threat in any significant way, since it is impossible for my pet leprechaun to kill her children. Or, if I died, and my will stated that I would kill this woman’s children if she did not have sex with me, clearly she would feel relieved rather than afraid, since I cannot conceivably act out my threat from beyond the grave. Thus we pay taxes because we know that if we do not, the likelihood of being aggressed against by representatives of the state is very high. If I do not pay my taxes, I will get a letter, then another letter, then a phone call, then a summons to court – and if I do not appear in court, or do not pay my back taxes and accumulated fines and interest, policemen will come with guns to take me to jail. If I resist those policemen, they will shoot me down.

To say that force equals voluntarism is completely illogical and self-contradictory. To say that the initiation of the use of force is completely equal to the non-initiation of the use of force is to say that up is down, black is white, and truth is falsehood.

Without the “null zone,” these corrupt fictions cannot be sustained.

The “null zone” is the lair of the beast we hunt.

As we can see, we know that personally it is wrong to steal; we have very few problems with an abstract and logical ban on theft, such as we have worked out above – yet still, there exists this “null zone” or alternate universe where such oppositions can be accepted without any question or concern.

According to UPB, it is wrong for me and you to steal. Yet somehow, in this “null zone,” it is not only allowed, but also perfectly *moral*, for others to steal. We *must not* steal – they *must* steal. It is moral madness!

### Policemen

Let us take our good friend Bob away from his little room of moral theory testing and restore him to his original job as a policeman.

Clearly, when Bob wakes up in the morning, before his shift, he cannot go to his neighbour’s house and demand money at the point of a gun, no matter who tells him that it’s all right.

When Bob has his breakfast, he also cannot attack his neighbour and take his money. On his drive to work – even though he has put on his uniform – he has not punched in yet, and thus has no more rights than any other citizen. When he punches in, however, now, as if there descends an amoral pillar of fire from the very heavens, he gains the amazing ability to morally attack his neighbours and take their money.

Strangely, this is the only characteristic of his that has utterly reversed itself. He cannot fly, he cannot change his shape, he cannot successfully digest ball bearings or live in an inferno; he cannot run one thousand kilometres an hour, and neither can he walk through a brick wall. He is absolutely, utterly, and completely *the same man as he was **before** he punched in* – yet now, he is subject to completely opposite moral rules.

Even more strangely, if I am not a “policeman,” but I follow Bob to work, and do exactly what he does – I put on a costume, walk into the police station, and put a piece of cardboard into a punch clock – why, if I then do exactly what Bob does, I am completely and totally immoral, although Bob’s identical actions are completely and totally *moral*.

What kind of sense does this make? How can we conceivably unravel this impenetrable mystery?

The simple fact is that it *cannot* be unravelled, because it is completely deranged. The fact that this “opposite world” moral madness is completely irrational – not to mention violently exploitive – is so obvious that it must be buried in an endless cavalcade of mythological “voluntarism.”

We are told that we “want” Bob to take our money – which completely contradicts the fact that Bob shows up on our doorstep pointing a loaded gun in our face. By this logic, I can also go up and down the street stealing money from my neighbours, and then claim to be utterly shocked when I am arrested:

“They *want* me to take their money!”

“But then why were you threatening to shoot them if they did not give you their money?”

“Because they *owe* me their money!”

“I thought you said that they want to give you their money.”

“No, no – they owe me. It’s really *my* money!”

“On what grounds do they owe you this money?”

“We have a contract!”

“Can you show me this contract? Have they signed this contract of their own free will?”

“It’s not that kind of contract! It’s a – *social* contract… And besides – according to that social contract, I own the whole street anyway – the whole damn neighbourhood in fact! Anyone who refuses to pay me my money can move somewhere else – I’m not forcing anyone!”

“And how do you know that you own the whole neighbourhood? Do you have ownership papers?”

“Yes, of course – have a look here!”

“Well, this is just a handwritten note saying that you own the whole neighbourhood – and it’s the same handwriting as your signature. I’m afraid that we’re going to have to book you – this is just a made-up contract with yourself, which you are inflicting on other people at the point of a gun.”

This is as completely insane and corrupt as me continuing to tell a woman I am raping that she *wants* to have sex with me. Can you imagine if I were on trial for rape, and there was a videotape of the woman begging me to stop, and I had a knife to her throat, how my defence would be received if I continued to insist that she actually *wanted* to have sex with me?

In court, I would be reviled, and thrown into jail for my obvious, mad, corrupt and self-serving hypocrisy.

Ah, but in the “null zone” of government, rape is lovemaking, kidnapping is invitation, rejecting theft is evil selfishness, and coercion is kindness.

This is what I mean when I say that this “opposite world *null zone*” is the most fundamental barrier to human happiness the world over. Stealing is wrong for us; stealing is wrong in the abstract – but stealing is somehow “right” in this insane alternate universe called “government”?

[^2]: Let’s not even get *started* on the logical nightmare of the truth value contained in the statement “error equals truth.”

[^3]: This argument tends also not to work very well with maths teachers – I have never seen a student successfully argue that an incorrect answer may be correct in another universe, and so it is unjust to mark it as wrong.
