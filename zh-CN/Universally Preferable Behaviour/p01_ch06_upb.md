## UPB：道德或美学？

一般来说，我们将使用美学这个术语来指不可强制执行的偏好 - 普遍的或个人的 - 而伦理或道德将指可执行的偏好。用科学方法来验证物理理论是普遍可取的（即要求的），但我们不能用武力对不使用科学方法的人施加科学方法，因为不使用科学方法不是暴力行为。非暴力行为本质上是可以避免的。如果一个物理学家停止使用科学的方法，而是开始咨询塔罗牌，他不会猛烈地选择我，我可以避开他。另一方面, 一个强奸犯是在他的受害者的暴力造成他的偏好。

虽然我们首先专注于UPB在伦理学领域，UPB现在可以被视为一个“保护伞条款，“包括学科：

•科学方法
•逻辑
•经验主义
•辩论
•语言
•伦理

伦理是UPB的一部分，涉及受到的行为或暴力的使用。任何证明或否认使用暴力的理论都是一种道德理论，并且要服从逻辑一致性和经验证据的要求。 

让我们看看三个行动，帮助我们进一步区分道德和美学。第一种行为是非理性；第二种是说谎；第三种是谋杀。[^9]

### 非理性

假设你和我正在辩论上帝的存在。在我提出我的论点之后，你拍拍你的耳朵，唱出上帝告诉你他是存在的，因此我所有的论证都毫无意义。显然，你对我的立场的反应是非理性的。不管我多么讨厌你的行为，我还是掏出枪来射击你，发泄我的沮丧，这似乎是不合理的。我认为，使用逻辑和证据，而不是依赖于我们头脑中的声音是普遍可取的，但这种普遍偏好在物理意义上不能通过暴力或威胁来合理地强制执行。

### 说谎

假设你和我为辩论设定了规则，我们都同意根据理性和证据来判断上帝存在的问题。如果，当争论还在继续，你又回到了一个盲目的信仰位置，拒绝我的论点，否则他们的理性和证据就不存在了。换句话说，当你说这个问题将由理性和证据来决定时，你在撒谎。

这两种情况（非理性与说谎）的区别在于契约和非契约安排的区别。如果我给你一百美元，然后走开，我不能在一年后公正地对你说你现在欠我一百美元，因为这是一笔贷款。另一方面，如果你同意在一年内把钱还给我，而不这样做，情况就完全不同了。

在“撒谎”的例子中，虽然你明显地打破了你的话，并浪费了我的时间，但我拔出枪来射击你，似乎也没有道义上的或合理的。

一个合理的道德理论应该能够解释为什么会这样情况。

### 谋杀

如果你用刀向我冲过来，很少有人会争辩我保护自己的权利。如果拍摄你是我能合理保证自己安全的唯一途径，那通常会被认为是一种令人遗憾的必要性。

### 对道德的要求

某些前提条件必须存在或被接受，以便道德判断或理论具有任何有效性或适用性。显然，选择和个人责任都必须接受为公理。如果一块石头从山上跳下来撞到你的汽车上，我们就不负责任，因为它没有意识，不能选择，因此不能承担个人的责任。如果岩石脱落，只是由于时间和地质，然后没有人负责由此造成的损害你的车。然而，如果你看到我把石头推出它的位置，你不会责怪石头，而是责怪我。添加一个进一步的并发症，如果事实证明我把岩石因为另一个男人强迫我在枪口下，你更可能会责怪持枪引发的情况，而不是我。

正如我们已经讨论过的那样，参加任何辩论都需要接受选择的现实、价值观和个人责任。然而，这些因素也存在于选择一个房间的油漆颜色，但我们不能说选择色调是一种道德选择。因此，为了使选择或命题成为道德，必须有其他标准必须存在。

我们都有偏好-从单纯的个人（“我喜欢冰淇淋”）到社会上更好的（“准时好”）到普遍的道德（“你不应该谋杀”）。

很少写关于个人的喜好–书我们可以找Ann Landers讨论社会最好的行为–那么在这里，我们将关注普遍优先行为的可能性。

### 选择

如果我接受你参加宴会的邀请，但我觉得谈话很无礼，我可以决定起身离开 -我也可以选择不接受你的另一个邀请。这种逃避和/或逃避的能力是区分美学和伦理学的一个基本特征。

如果，当我决定离开你的晚宴派对时，你跳起来把我拉到我的椅子上，很明显我再也没有自由选择离开了。这时，你的粗鲁变成公然的侵略，越过美学走向道德的界限。

If, after vowing monogamy, I cheat on my wife, and she decides to leave me, I have certainly done her wrong, but the wrong that I have done by cheating would be very different from the wrong I would do if I lock her in the basement to prevent her from leaving. We would not generally consider a wife who shoots her husband for infidelity to be acting morally, but we would recognise the regrettable necessity if she had to use violence to escape from her imprisonment. In the first situation, the wife has the free choice and capacity to *leave* her husband, and thus violence would be an unjust response to the situation; in the second situation, her choice to leave her husband has been eliminated through imprisonment. Infidelity does not destroy a partner’s capacity to choose; locking her in the basement does.

### Avoidance

If you and I are both standing at the top of a cliff, and I turn to you and say, “Stand in front of me, so I can push you off the cliff,” what would your response be? If you do voluntarily stand in front of me, and I then push you off the cliff, this would more likely be considered a form of suicide on your part, rather than murder on my part. The reason for this is that you can very easily *avoid* being pushed off the cliff, simply by refusing to stand in front of me.

Similarly, if I meet you in a bar, and say: “I want you to come back to my place, so I can tie you to the bed and starve you to death,” if you do in fact come back to my place, it is with the reasonable knowledge that your longevity will not be enhanced by your decision. On the other hand, if I slip a “date rape” drug into your drink, and you wake up tied to my bed, it is clear that there is little you could have done to avoid the situation.

This question of *avoidance* is key to differentiating aesthetics from ethics. Aesthetics applies to situations that may be unpleasant, but which do not eliminate your capacity to choose.

#### Avoidance And Initiation

There is a particular issue with avoidance that will come up later in this book, which is worth clearing up here beforehand.

If I live on a high mountaintop five thousand kilometres away from you, and send you an e-mail telling you that if you ever walk in front of my house, I am going to shoot you, it is relatively easy for you to avoid this situation. My threat of force is certainly immoral, but questions would surely be raised if you immediately jumped on a plane, climbed my mountain and slowly strolled in front of my house.

On the other hand, if you live on a dead-end street, and I tell you that if you take that street to get home, I will shoot you, your capacity to avoid this situation becomes significantly limited. You could certainly tunnel into your house, or jump over a bunch of backyard fences, but all of this would be considerably inconvenient.

In a similar manner, if a representative of organised crime comes to my house and threatens to burn it down if I do not pay regular protection money, I can avoid that specific threat by moving to another continent, but that would seem like a rather unjust way to deal with the situation, since I must now initiate action in order to avoid the threat.

For the moment, we can assume that *any* threat of the initiation of violence is immoral, but the question of avoidance – particularly the *degree* of avoidance required – is also important. In general, the more that a threat interferes with the normal course of daily actions, the more egregious it is. If I have to fly to another continent in order to walk in front of your house, that is scarcely an everyday activity. If I am threatened with violence for walking down the only road towards my own home, that is a far worse intrusion upon my liberties. If I have to take specific and unprecedented action to trigger a threat, that is one thing – if I trigger the threat through normal everyday activities, that is quite another. Telling you I will slap you if you stand on your head on the dark side of the moon is scarcely a threat – telling you I will slap you if you *breathe* is.

### Ethics, Aesthetics, And Avoidability

Let’s say that you and I agree to meet at a certain location at six o’clock sharp – but then I show up half an hour late. What would your reaction be? At first, you may be a little annoyed. If I tell you that I was delayed because I stopped to give a dying man CPR and saved his life, your annoyance would likely be replaced with admiration. On the other hand, if I tell you that I am late because I was playing a video game, your annoyance would probably increase. A dying man’s need for CPR is unexpected, and therefore pretty much unavoidable – continuing to play a video game is easily avoidable, and clearly shows a lack of consideration for you.

It is this capacity to *avoid* situations that forms a central root of ethical judgements A woman raped by a random intruder in her own home is undoubtedly the complete victim of a terrible crime. A woman who gets raped after getting blind drunk at a frat party and dancing naked on a tabletop presents a more complicated case. Clearly the rape, once under way, cannot be avoided, since it is being violently inflicted – however, situations which increase the likelihood of rape can be avoided.

If someone breaks into my house and takes my wallet at gunpoint, I have every right to be outraged. If, however, I leave my wallet sitting on a park bench for a week, do I have the same right to be outraged when I return to find it gone? Instinctively we feel that this would seem to be less justified.

Clearly, this question of avoidance is central to our moral evaluation of cause and effect. Illnesses that strike without warning, and which cannot be prevented, frighten us far more than those that we can avoid. We can minimise the chances of getting lung cancer by refraining from smoking, just as we can help prevent skin cancer by using sunscreen, and avoid broken bones by eschewing extreme sports. Similarly, we can do much to avoid crime through some fairly simple habits, such as choosing moral companions, avoiding locales and situations where crime is more probable, refraining from substance abuse and so on.

There is a phenomenon known as “death by cop,” wherein suicidal people provoke an altercation with the police, then pretend to reach for a gun in order to get shot. This is an extreme example of pursuing situations where “victimisation” is almost guaranteed. This can also occur in domestic situations, wherein a wife will verbally attack a drunken husband, knowing perfectly well that alcohol inflames his violent temper. In these situations, we can have some sympathy for the man whose wallet is stolen in the park, or the woman who is attacked at the frat party, or the wife who is beaten by her husband – but at the same time, we would have some significant questions regarding their role or complicity in the wrongs they have suffered. To be just, we must differentiate between a man whose wallet is stolen at gunpoint, and a man who leaves his wallet lying around in a public place. Both men have had their wallets stolen, to be sure, but it would scarcely seem reasonable to hold them equally accountable.

Can the UPB framework help us understand, classify and extend these moral standards?
