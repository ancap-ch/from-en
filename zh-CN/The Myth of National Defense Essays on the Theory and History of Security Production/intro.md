托马斯.杰斐逊证实了《美国独立宣言》所说

> 真理是不辩自明的：人生来平等；造物主赋予人类不可剥夺的权利；其中包括生存，自由，对幸福的追求：为了保障这些权利，政府在人类中建立起来，权利来自被统治者的许可；不管什么样的政府，只要危害到人民的这些权利，人们就有权利改变或者废除这些政府，并建立起新政府，人们以这样的原则为基石，并以似乎最能影响到他们的安全和幸福的形式组织权利。 为了谨慎起见，成立多年的政府不应当因为轻微的一时的原因而改变；因此，所有经验表明，在罪恶可容忍时人们更倾向于忍受，而不是通过废除他们已习惯的形式来纠正。 当有一连串滥用职权和强取豪夺始终追求同一目标，这表明一个会使它们沦落到极其专制统治下的计划，他们有义务为了他们未来的安全稳定提供新保卫而推翻这样的政府，这是他们的权利。

在提出独立宣言的两百年后，提出这个问题似乎是恰如其分的：政府是否已按所设计地行事，经验或是理论已经有根有据地为我们提出了考虑我们未来的安全稳定的更有效的保障。 本卷旨在问答这个基本问题。 事实上，最近由于2001年9月11日发生的事件让这个问题呈现出新的紧迫感。 政府应该保护我们远离恐怖主义。 然而，美国在政府在恐怖分子袭击世界贸易中心和五角大楼中起了什么作用？ 美国政府命令每年要有十亿美元的国防预算，它的总数等于24个最大政府支出国年度国防预算之和。 它雇佣全球范围内的间谍和告密者。 然而，它无法阻止商业客机被劫持，并被用作对抗杰出公民和军事目标的导弹。 更糟糕的是，美国政府不仅没能阻止9月11日的灾难，事实上促成了这一事件发生的可能性。 奉行干涉主义的外交政策（在一百多个国家采取经济制裁，驻扎部队，无情地轰炸，扶持专制政权，在无法解决的土地问题和民族纠纷中偏袒，或试图在全球范围内进行军政管理），政府给外国恐怖分子提供了十足的动机，也让美国成为了他们的首要目标。 此外，如果士兵们只装备了几把刀，那么他们会造成多么可怕的伤害呢? 显然，这是可能的，因为政府禁止航空公司和飞行员用武力保护自己的财产，从而使每一家商业航空公司都容易受到侵害，免受劫机者的侵害。在驾驶舱里，一支价值50美元的手枪可能已经完成了政府手中4000亿美元无法做到的事情。从这些失败中吸取了什么教训？在事件发生后，美国的外交政策更加积极地进行干预和威胁。美军推翻阿富汗政府，被说成是“窝藏”的恐怖分子 Osama bin Laden (奥萨马•本•拉登)。在这一过程中，数千无辜平民被杀害为“附带损害”，但斌拉扥没有被抓获或惩罚到今天，几乎两年后的攻击。美国政府一旦在阿富汗安装，美国政府就把注意力转向与其他敌国，特别是拥有巨大石油储备的伊拉克的战争。美国甚至拒绝排除对付敌方政权的核武器。毫无疑问，这一政策有助于进一步将新兵人数提高到愿意对美国采取极端暴力作为报复手段的人群中。与此同时，国内政府利用危机，煽动进一步增加自己的权力，牺牲人民的自由和财产权利。政府支出，尤其是“防务”的支出大大增加，新的“国土安全”政府部门也建立起来了。机场安全由联邦政府和政府官员接管，并采取了一个完整的电子公民监督的决定性步骤。那么，事实上，当前的事件迫切需要对国防和安全问题进行系统的重新思考，以及政府、市场和社会在提供这些问题方面各自的作用。

政治经济学家和政治哲学家中最普遍接受的两个主题是：第一，从消费者的角度来看，每一个“垄断”都是“坏的”。垄断在这里被理解为古典意义上的排他性特权给予一个单一的生产者的商品或服务；也就是说，由于没有“自由进入”到一个特定的生产线。换句话说，只有一个代理商A可以生产给定的商品x。任何这样的垄断者对于消费者来说都是“坏”的，因为他们会阻止潜在的新进入者进入他的生产领域，他的产品x的价格会更高，而x的质量会更低。第二，安全生产必须由政府承担，是政府的主要职能。在这里，独立宣言”所采用的宽泛意义上的安全被理解为：保护生命，财产（自由）以及追求家庭暴力（犯罪）以及外部（外国）侵略（战争）的幸福。按照一般公认的术语，政府是法律和秩序的地域垄断（最终的决策者和执行者）。这两个命题显然是不相容的，很少引起经济学家和哲学家的关注，就目前而言，典型的反应是对第一个命题而不是第二个命题的反应。本书的贡献者挑战了这种“正统”观点，并为相反论点提供了经验和理论上的支持：第二个命题而不是第一个命题是错误的，应该被拒绝。就经验历史证据而言，正统观点的支持者面临着明显的尴尬。最近结束的二十世纪的特点是在所有人类历史上无与伦比的侵犯人权行为。鲁道夫•鲁梅尔（Rudolph Rummel）在“政府的死亡”一书中估计，二十世纪约有一亿七千万人死于政府。历史证据表明，政府不应该保护公民的生命，自由和追求幸福，而应该被视为对人类安全的最大威胁。正统观点的支持者（愿意妥协第一个关于垄断的“邪恶”，以维持第二个国家政府的必要性）的论点，不能完全忽视这一看似压倒性的证据。如果他们想从反驳政府为法律和秩序提供必不可少的论点出发，就必须修改第二篇论文。经验表明，一些国家是侵略者，而不是保护者。因此，如果不是完全抛弃第二个论点，那么就需要进一步的说明：只能说有些国家是保护的。因此，在过去的一个世纪里，特别是在令人沮丧的安全记录方面，政府没有像这样破坏政府，而是试图将这一记录解释为特定政府形式的结果。许多政治科学家，包括上述鲁梅尔，试图通过各种统计方法，它是缺乏民主的政府，这说明了“异常”的二十世纪。诚然，民主国家发动战争反对非民主政权，但不会对其他民主国家。因此，它似乎跟本文也成为美国新保守主义的民间传说的一部分，一旦威尔逊主义者实现了“为世界安全的民主”的梦想，永恒的和平与安全就会实现。同样，像詹姆斯•布坎南（James Buchanan）和“宪政经济学派”这样的政治经济学家也暗示，政府在内部和外部安全方面的悲惨记录可以通过旨在严格限制的宪法改革来系统地改善的政府权力。这两个解释都在本卷中被审查和否决。。对于民主的和平性质的论文，几位作者指出，与军事历史学家如J.F.C. Fuller 和 M. Howard，这是一个选择性的、甚至是错误的阅读历史记录。让我只提两个这样的误读。首先，这篇论文怎么能说明一个看似明显的反例，比如美国南部独立战争（美国之间的战争）以及其前所未有的无情暴虐？答：通过排除和忽略它或淡化它的意义。其次，和平民主主义的支持者通常支持他们的主张，将传统君主制和现代独裁分为独裁和非民主，并将他们归类为真正的“民主国家”。然而历史上（如果有任何分组的话）应该把民主和专政统一起来。传统的君主制只不过是表面上的独裁统治。相反，独裁统治是大众民主的常态产物。与俄罗斯，德国，奥地利和中国的前皇帝相比，列宁，斯大林，希特勒和毛泽东明显是民主的统治者。事实上，列宁，斯大林，希特勒和毛泽东（以及他们几乎所有规模较小，知名度较低的接班人）都坦率地憎恨君主和贵族的一切。他们知道自己是民主的大众政治的崛起者，他们统治时期就采用了民主政治（选举，公民投票，群众集会，大众传媒宣传等）。另一方面，关于旨在限制国家政权的宪法改革的提议，本书的几位撰稿人解释说，如果对这种限制的解释和执行留给政府的话，任何这种尝试都应被视为徒劳无益本身或其一个机构，如政府最高法院。（请参阅下面的更多内容。）本书的贡献者更可信的是第三篇论文，由经济学家路德维希•冯•米塞斯（Ludwig von Mises）提出，可能被认为是上述的结合。Mises说，为了履行其作为安全提供者的主要职能，政府必须满足两个条件：必须民主地组织起来，而且必须原则上允许无限分离。








> 每当一个特定地区的居民，无论是一个村庄，整个地区或相邻地区，让它知道，由一个自由进行公民投票，他们不再希望保持团结的国家所属的时候，他们的愿望是要尊重和遵守。这是防止革命和国际战争的唯一切实可行的有效途径。 （路德维希•冯•米塞斯（Ludwig von Mises），自由主义[纽约的欧文顿（Irvington-on-Hudson），纽约：经济教育基金会，旧金山，加利福尼亚州：科布登出版社，1985 ]，109页）

One obvious attraction of this thesis is that it can account for the events of the American War of Southern Independence. Thus, until 1861, it was generally taken for granted in the U.S. that a right to secession existed, and that the Union was nothing but a voluntary association of independent states; but when the desire for the unrestricted right to secede was no longer respected, the state turned from protector to aggressor. Mises’s thesis is accorded considerable attention in this volume, and the role of secession as a means for limiting or escaping government depredation is emphasized repeatedly. However, in requiring a protective state to allow unlimited secession from its jurisdiction, Mises’s explanation essentially renders the State a voluntary membership organization with taxes amounting to voluntarily paid (or withheld) membership dues. With an unlimited right to secession even at the level of individual households, the government is no longer a “State,” but a club. Hence, strictly speaking, Mises’s thesis must be considered a rejection of proposition two rather than merely its revision. The contributors to this volume concur with this judgment, not only for empirical reasons but even more so for theoretical ones. Every attempt to explain the dismal performance of governments (States) qua providers of security as inherent in the nature of state-government must begin with a precise definition of state-government (the State). The definition of the State adopted throughout this volume is uncontroversial. It corresponds closely to that proposed by Thomas Hobbes and adopted to this day by countless political philosophers and economists. Briefly, Hobbes argued that in the state of nature, men would constantly be at each others’ throats. *Homo homini lupus est*. Each individual, left to his own devices and provisions, would spend too little on his own defense. Hence, permanent interpersonal warfare would result. The solution to this presumably intolerable situation, according to Hobbes and his followers, is the institution of a State (government). In order to institute peaceful cooperation—security—among themselves, two individuals, A and B, require a third independent party, S, as ultimate judge and peacemaker. However, this third party, S, is not just another individual, and the good provided by S, that of security, is not just another “private” good. Rather, S is a sovereign and has as such two unique powers. On the one hand, S can insist that his subjects, A and B, not seek protection from anyone but him; that is, S is a compulsory territorial monopolist of protection and ultimate decision making (jurisdiction). On the other hand, S can determine unilaterally (without unanimous consent) how much A and B must spend on their own security; that is, S has the power to impose taxes in order to provide security “collectively.” Based on this definition of government as a compulsory territorial monopolist of protection and jurisdiction equipped with the power to tax without unanimous consent, the contributors to this volume argue that, regardless of whether such a government is a monarchy, a democracy, or a dictatorship, any notion of limiting its power and safeguarding individual life, liberty, and property must be deemed illusory. Under monopolistic auspices the price of justice and protection must rise and its quality must fall. A tax-funded protection agency, it is pointed out, is a contradiction in terms: it is an expropriating property protector and can only lead to ever more taxes and less protection. In fact, even if a state limited its activities exclusively to the protection of life, liberty, and property (as a protective state à la Jefferson would do), the further question of how much security to provide would arise. Motivated like everyone else by selfinterest and the disutility of labor, but with the unique power to tax without consent, a government’s answer will always be the same: to maximize expenditures on protection—and almost all of a nation’s wealth can be consumed by the cost of protection—and at the same time to minimize the production of protection. Furthermore, a monopoly of jurisdiction must lead to a deterioration in the quality of justice and protection. If one can appeal only to the State for justice and protection, justice and protection will be distorted in favor of government—constitutions and supreme courts notwithstanding. After all, constitutions and supreme courts are state constitutions and courts, and whatever limitations to government action they might contain is determined by agents of the very same institution. Accordingly, the definitions of life, liberty, and property and their protection will continually be altered and the range of jurisdiction expanded to the state’s advantage. The first person to provide a systematic explanation for the apparent failure of governments as security producers along the above sketched lines was Gustave de Molinari (1818–1912), a prominent Belgian-born French economist, student of JeanBaptiste Say, and teacher of Vilfredo Pareto, and for several decades the editor of the *Journal des Économistes*, the professional journal of the French Economic Association, *the Societé d’Économie Politique*. De Molinari’s central argument was laid out in his article “De la Production de la Securité” of February 1849. The argument is worth quoting because of its theoretical rigor and its seemingly visionary foresight:

> If there is one well-established truth in political economy, it is this: That in all cases, for all commodities that serve to provide for the tangible or intangible needs of consumers, it is in the consumer’s best interest that labor and trade remain free, because the freedom of labor and trade have as their necessary and permanent result the maximum reduction of price. And this: That the interests of the consumer of any commodity whatsoever should always prevail over the interests of the producer. Now in pursuing these principles, one arrives at this rigorous conclusion: That the production of security should, in the interests of the consumers of this intangible commodity, remain subject to the law of free competition. Whence it follows: That no government should have the right to prevent another government from going into competition with it, or require consumers of security to come exclusively to it for this commodity... Either this is logically true, or else the principles on which economic science is based are invalid. (Gustave de Molinari, *Production of Security*, J.H. McCulloch, trans. [New York: Center for Libertarian Studies, 1977], pp. 3–4)

De Molinari then predicted what would happen if the production of security is monopolized:

> If, on the contrary, the consumer is not free to buy security wherever he pleases, you forthwith see open up a large profession dedicated to arbitrariness and bad management. Justice becomes slow and costly, the police vexatious, individual liberty is no longer respected, the price of security is abusively inflated and inequitably apportioned, according to the power and influence of this or that class of consumers. (Molinari, *Production of Security*, pp. 13–14)

Nearly all contributors to this volume pay explicit tribute to Molinari’s pathbreaking theoretical insight. Hence, the present volume is dedicated to the memory of Gustave de Molinari. If Molinari’s explanation of the dismal performance of government as security provider by the nature of government qua compulsory territorial monopolist of law and order is accepted, however, then the question of alternatives arises. Accordingly, the bulk of this volume consists of contributions to this quest for private and voluntary (market-produced) alternatives to the failed and fundamentally flawed system of state-protection. How could and would an alternative system of freely competing security producers work? Based on historical experience and economic logic, how effective are private alternatives such as mercenaries, guerrillas, militias, partisans, and privateers? What are the consequences of the free proliferation of weapons, in particular of nuclear arms? What is the role of ideology and public opinion in defense and war? What type of good is defense, a “private” or a “public” good? Can protective defense be provided by freely competing and financed insurance agencies? How would the “logic” of competitive insurance-protection differ from that of monopolistic state-protection? How can the transition from a system of monopolistic to competitive security production be achieved? What is the role of secession in this process? How can state-free societies—natural orders—possibly defend themselves against state attacks and invasions? These are the central questions addressed and answered in the present volume by an international assembly of contributors from philosophy, economics, history, sociology, and political science.

The contributions to Section One on state-making and warmaking set the stage historically and conceptually. Marco Bassani and Carlo Lottieri locate the topic and theme of the volume in history and the history of political thought. They emphasize the historical modernity of the institution of a State—States have not always existed—and direct particular attention to medieval (feudal) Europe as an example of a “Society without State,” from which valuable insights regarding the present and its possible paths of transformation can be gained. They explain the ideological revolution, associated with such names as Machiavelli, Bodin, Hobbes, and Rousseau, that supported and led up to the rise of the State. They review the rise of a liberal-libertarian ideological opposition to Statism, associated in particular with the names of Molinari (in the nineteenth century) and Rothbard (in the twentieth). They note the importance of European “realism,” i.e., the “elitist” social theorists such as G. Mosca, V. Pareto, and R. Michels in Italy and Carl Schmitt in Germany, for a correct understanding of the “non-neutral” nature of the State and sovereignty. And they explore the prospects for liberty and protection in the current world torn between a tendency toward political centralization (a One World Order) and an opposite tendency toward decentralization and secession. Murray N. Rothbard (1926–1995), the author of the second contribution to Section One, is the most important twentiethcentury disciple of Molinari. In synthesizing Molinari’s monopoly (or rather antimonopoly) theory with Ludwig von Mises’s neo-Austrian system of free-market economics (praxeology) and natural-law ethics, Rothbard created a grand new anti-Statist theoretical system, of Austro-Libertarianism. As they were by Molinari, most contributors to this volume have been profoundly influenced by Rothbard and his system. In his contribution to this volume, published originally in 1963 and reprinted here with the permission of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, Rothbard introduces the conceptual and terminological distinctions fundamental to all of the following. He clarifies the meaning of property, aggression, crime, selfdefense, punishment, State, peace, war (“just” and “unjust”), revolution, imperialism, neutrality, and isolationism, and he explains the inherently aggressive nature of the State, i.e., the indissoluble link between War-Making and State-Making. The contributions to Section Two focus on the subject of government forms, war, and strategy. Erik von Kuehnelt-Leddihn (1909–1999), in the last article completed before his death, presents a sweeping portrait of European history and the role of monarchy and Christian kings. In the European-Christian worldview, the king was seen as part of a natural, quasi-familial hierarchical or “vertical” social order: of “God the Father in Heaven, the Holy Father in Rome, the King as the Father of the Fatherland, and the Father as the King in the Family.” He describes the gradual deconstruction of this vertical worldview and its displacement, beginning with the French Revolution and completed with World War I and II, by a “new” egalitarian or “horizontal” outlook incompatible with monarchy and kings. He identifies democracy (majority rule), socialism (international and national), and popular dictatorship as expressions of this new horizontal worldview. Furthermore, he provides ample historical illustration of how the transformation from monarchy to democracy changed the conduct of war from limited warfare to total war. Gerard Radnitzky, in his wide-ranging essay, bolsters Kuehnelt-Leddihn’s case against democracy. Following Anthony de Jasay, Radnitzky begins with a detailed analysis of the economics and politics of majoritarian democracy and refutes as illusory and impossible the claims of constitutional economists such as James Buchanan. A discussion of the thesis “democracies are more peaceful” occupies the center of his chapter. Based on analytical considerations and detailed historical evidence, Radnitzky rejects the thesis.Further, he identifies the thesis “that democracies do not make war with each other” as “a cornerstone of the New World Order crowd” and U.S. imperialism and hegemony. He concludes with a few game-theoretical considerations regarding the possibility of private defense coalitions and some remarks on the likelihood of the decline and demise of the State. Bertrand Lemennicier provides an economic-conceptual and formalistic, game-theoretical explanation of the effects and prospects of government policies and treaties concerning the nonproliferation of nuclear weapons. In accordance with standard economic cartel theory, Lemennicier argues that any such agreements are bound to fail due to external and internal pressure. The cartel members cannot lastingly prevent nonmember countries from developing nuclear weapons independently. And within the cartel, each member has a constant incentive to cheat (and sell). Moreover, Lemennicier argues that even if a cartel agreement could be maintained and enforced, this would still be a “bad” idea. The world is made less safe rather than more so when a single country dominates in nuclear possession and enforcement. “The U.S. retains a monopoly on nuclear dissuasion and plays the part of world enforcer, excluding international exchanges for countries seeking nuclear weapons,” writes Lemennicier. “Such a position is costly, and the U.S. has no legitimate claim to such a role.” The contributions to Section Three review the historical record of private alternatives to State defense and warfare. Joseph Stromberg considers the example of professional “standing armies” commanded by aristocratic officers. He looks at the experience with mercenary armies in Renaissance Italy. He discusses the role of a militia in republican theory and practice from ancient Greece and Rome to the United States and Switzerland. Special attention is given to guerrilla warfare. Its essentially defensive nature is explained, and its role in the American Revolution, in the War for Southern Independence, and in the Second Anglo-Boer War is discussed. Based on this evidence, Stromberg suggests as a solution to the problem of defensive protection some combination of voluntary militias (inspired if possible by a unifying ideology or faith) and modern mercenaries (in the form of professional insurance-protection companies), both steeped in the theory and practice of guerrilla warfare. Larry Sechrest opens his contribution with a brief discussion of the nature of the “good” of defense and argues that defense is a distinctly “private” good (while “national defense” is an “imaginary” good). He then applies these theoretical considerations to the subject of naval warfare. In particular, he provides a detailed survey of “privateering” as a form of naval warfare conducted by privately owned ships from the twelfth to the nineteenth centuries. Sechrest explains how privateers operated, the legal customs that grew up around them, and how remarkably effective and profitable they were. Finally, as to why the practice of privateering declined after the nineteenth century, Sechrest argues that this has no technological reasons. To the contrary, privateering died out because it was “too” effective and threatened the jobs of the regular State-navies. Jeffrey Rogers Hummel begins with a discussion of the anthropological preconditions of State formation and the reasons for the historical triumph of States over Stateless societies. He explores the reasons—population size, geography, political decentralization, wealth and technology—for the success of some States and world regions and the failure of others. In particular, Hummel investigates and emphasizes the importance of ideas and ideological convictions, of motivation and morale, in war and defense. Finally, he ponders the ideological requirements of liberating oneself of the “macroparasitism” of one’s own State and the prospects of defending a free territory against the potential aggression of another, foreign State. Hummel expresses considerable optimism regarding the effectiveness of such a defense—because free societies will be wealthier and technologically more advanced than statist societies—but cautions that the maintenance of a free society (rather than a regression to Statism) requires eternal ideological vigilance on the part of the public. The final section, Section Four, is dedicated to the theory of private security production and its various practical applications. In his contribution, Walter Block argues that to claim “that a tax collecting government can legitimately protect its citizens against aggression is to contradict oneself, since such an entity starts off the entire process by doing the very opposite of protecting those under its control.” In support of this claim, Block reviews, analyzes, and refutes the entire panoply of statist arguments: the “prisoner’s dilemma,” the “free rider,” the “externality,” and the “public goods” thesis in favor of “national defense.” Defense, Block explains, is defense of private property and as “private” as private property. Last, he discusses the thesis, popular especially in “public choice” and “constitutional economics” circles, that States are forms of clubs (and clubs forms of States), and he concurs with Joseph Schumpeter’s verdict that this thesis “only proves how far removed this part of the social sciences is from scientific habits of mind.” In my own contribution to this volume, I open with a reconstruction the Hobbesian myth of “collective security” and its empirical and logical refutation. He then proceeds to a detailed analysis of risk, property, and insurance. He comments on the “arbitrariness” of “national” borders, and hence of “national” defense (in contrast to the “natural” borders of private property and the defense of such borders). He provides a comparative analysis of insurance-protection versus State-protection and contrasts the logic of State-warfare to that of freely financed protection agencies. Finally, Hoppe points out that insurance agencies, in contrast to States, will not disarm those they protect, and he addresses the question of how a free and armed society in conjunction with professional protection-insurance agencies would likely go about defending itself against State aggression. Guido Hülsmann, in the final contribution to this volume, deals with secession as a means of establishing a private-property order and assuring effective protection. He discusses the nature of secession and its comparative advantages as compared to other forms of political reform. After examining the conditions that must be met for secession to be successful, Hülsmann turns to a key problem of secessionist movements: defense against the government from which they are seceding. He argues that secessionist defense organizations must themselves be run on the basis of private-property principles to ensure that the political goal of libertarian secession be reached and that its military effectiveness be as high as possible. Though the implications of the arguments made in this volume are radical and sweeping, the principles are quite simple at root. In economics, the contributors seek the consistent application of market theory, not its arbitrary exclusion from whole areas of life, such that it applies also to the delivery of goods and services associated with security and defense. In politics, the contributors seek only the application of the principle Jefferson presented in his Declaration of Independence, that people have the right and duty to throw off governments that are not effecting their safety and find alternatives that provide guards for future security. In both respects, these ideas represent a relatively unexplored application of traditional liberal theory. And yet, given the continued rise of the national-security state in our own time, the future of liberty itself may hinge on our willingness to push these principles to their fullest extent.
