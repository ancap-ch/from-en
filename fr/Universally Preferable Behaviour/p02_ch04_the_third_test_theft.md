## The Third Test: Theft

We will have to spend a little bit more time on theft, since it inevitably brings into the picture the question of property rights, which is highly contentious for some.

There are many ways of approaching the question of property rights, from “homesteading” to legal definitions to practical considerations etc. I will address none of those here, because the question of property rights must fall into the framework of UPB, if UPB is to stand as a rational methodology for evaluating moral propositions.

Clearly, the moral proposition with regard to property rights is this: either human beings have the right to own property, or they do not.

Now the first “property” that must be dealt with is the body. “Ownership” must first and foremost consist of control over one’s own body, because if that control does not exist, or is not considered valid, then the whole question of morality – let alone property – goes out the window.

UPB is a framework for evaluating moral propositions, or arguments about universally preferable behaviour for all mankind. First and foremost, a man must be responsible for his own actions if they are to be judged morally, since as we have argued above, the capacity to choose actions is fundamental to any ethical evaluation.

If a man has no control over his body, then clearly he has no responsibility for his actions – they are not in fact “his” actions, but rather the actions of his body. Now, no one would rationally argue that if a man strangles another man, it is the murderous fingers that should be put on trial and punished. Clearly, the body cannot entirely control itself, but rather must be to some degree under the direction of the conscious mind.

What this means is that a man is responsible for the actions of his body, and therefore he is responsible for the *effects* of those actions. A man is responsible for where he puts his penis, which is how we know that we can judge him for raping someone. He “owns” the actions of his body as surely as he owns his body. To say that a man is responsible for his body but not the effects of his body is to argue that a man is responsible for aiming and throwing a knife, but not for where it lands.

Also, arguing that a man is not responsible for the effects of his body is a self-detonating statement, similar to the ones we examined above. If I say to you: “Men are not responsible for the actions of their bodies,” it would be eminently fair for you to ask me who is working my vocal chords and mouth. If I say that I have no control over my speech – which is an effect of the body – then I have “sustained” my thesis at the cost of invalidating it completely.

If I am not at all responsible for my speech, then there is no point arguing with me. A tape recorder is also not responsible for its speech, which is why we tend not to get into virulent disagreements with magnetic strips. In cheesy horror films, young girls seem to be particularly susceptible to demonic possession – the inevitable priest who shows up always offers to talk to the demon in charge of the girl, at which point the girl starts making a sound like Don Ho gargling with ball bearings.

This ridiculous portrait is accurate in one sense though – if some other being is in full control of the girl’s vocal chords, it is that being which needs to be addressed, not the girl, who has no control over her responses.

Thus if I say to you that I do not have control over my speech, you can ask me: who does? If I reply that no one does, then it makes about as much sense to argue with me as it does to argue with a television set, or the aforementioned boulder as it bounces down a hillside towards you car.

Thus the very act of controlling my body to produce speech demands the acceptance of my ability to control my speech – an implicit affirmation of my ownership over my own body.

Now, if demonic possession were a valid occurrence, and a girl possessed by a demon spat on a priest, we would not call the *girl* rude, but would rather pity her for being inhabited by such an impolite demon. Whoever has control over the girl’s body is culpable for the effects of her actions – this is why we would not call a man who stole while sleepwalking “evil,” since he did not have full control over his own body (although we may restrain him in other ways). This is also the basis for the legal defence of “not guilty by reason of insanity,” which is that we assume that a man who is insane does not have full control over his actions.

Thus to reject the ownership of the body is to reject all morality, which, as we have seen above, is utterly impossible. Logically, since morality is defined as an enforceable subset of UPB, to reject morality is to say that it is universally preferable to believe that there is no such thing as universal preferences.

Finally, to use one’s ownership of one’s own body in the form of speech to reject the notion that one can control one’s own body, is a blatant and insurmountable self-contradiction.

It is in this way that any rejection of self-ownership can be utterly discarded.

Since we own our bodies, we also inevitably own the *effects* of our actions, be they good or bad. If we own the effects of our actions, then clearly we own that which we produce, whether what we produce is a bow, or a book – or a murder.

### Property And UPB

Even if we reject the above, we can still use UPB to definitively assert the existence of universal property rights.

As mentioned above, either human beings have property rights, or they do not. Except for a few grey areas, which we will get to shortly, this remains a universal proposition.

If a man does not have the right to use property, then he does not have the right to use his own body. He does not have the right to use his own lungs, and therefore must stop breathing. Although this sounds silly, it is an immediate and inevitable result of the premise that human beings do not have property rights.

It is fairly safe to assume that anyone you are debating property rights with is drawing breath, and thus agrees with you that he has the right to use his own body at least.

The question then comes up whether or not human beings have the right to *exclusive* property use. For instance, property could be defined as a sort of time-share principle of ownership, insofar as everyone should have the right to own everything, on some schedule or another.

This means of course that a man with lung cancer has a right to at least one lung of a healthy person. Since all ownership starts with the body, if we do not have the right to exclusive ownership over our own body, then we must share our body with other people, or be immoral. The sick man has a right to one of our lungs, and if we withhold it from him, that is exactly the same as stealing it. Similarly, both you and I have the right to use Celine Dion’s singing voice, since it is wholly selfish of her to pretend that she has exclusive ownership of it.

If human beings do not possess exclusive ownership over their own bodies, then the crime of rape becomes meaningless, since a woman clearly does not exclusively own her vagina, and neither does a man own his own various orifices. If exclusive self-ownership is not an axiom, then even the crime of murder becomes meaningless.

It is no crime to commit suicide, any more than it is to set fire to your own house, since the destruction of one’s own property is a valid exercise of ownership. However, if exclusive self-ownership is invalid, then there can be no distinction between murder and suicide. If my liver is failing, and I have a right to take yours, then I can “repossess” it in perfect accordance with morality and honourable behaviour. If this procedure kills you, so what? Without exclusive self-ownership, there is no “you” to begin with…

Thus we can reasonably say that exclusive self-ownership is a basic reality – that all human beings at all times and in all places have exclusive ownership over their own bodies, and thus have exclusive ownership over the effects of their own bodies, both in terms of moral behaviour and property creation or acquisition.

### The Grey Areas

Naturally, any statement such as the above brings the inevitable howls of “complexity,” which I fully agree with.

Let us say that I mean to give you five dollars as a gift, but by mistake I hand you a ten dollar bill, saying, “This is for you.” Few people would consider it theft if I said, the moment after I handed it to you: “Sorry, I meant to give you five dollars, not ten,” and took the larger note back, even though I am taking back property that I have voluntarily relinquished.

On the other extreme, if you are one of my sons, and I pay for your university education, and explicitly tell you that you never need to pay me back, my generosity will doubtless affect your spending habits. It would scarcely seem reasonable for me to clap my forehead after your graduation ceremony and cry, “Oh, I thought you were one of my *other* sons!” and demand repayment.

Similarly, it is generally accepted that children cannot enter into legal contracts, but that adults can. In many societies, the differentiating age is eighteen years. This means, of course, that at the stroke of midnight between a man’s seventeenth year and eighteenth birthday, his capacity to enter into legal contracts arrives fully formed. Has he gone through some massive biological transformation in that split second? Certainly not, although at eighteen he is biologically very different than he was at the age of ten, both in terms of physical and mental development.

For the sake of efficiency, if not perfect morality, arbitrary transitions are often placed between one state and another. Childhood is definitely one state; adulthood is quite another. The transition between childhood and adulthood is blended; it is not black and white, but rather like the day descending into dusk, and then night. Noon is definitely not night, and midnight is definitely not daytime, but there are times in between when it is harder to tell, although the direction of the transition is always clear.

In the same way, a man who is greatly mentally deficient can be considered far less responsible for his own actions. A man with an IQ of sixty-five is mentally scarcely more than a little child – a man with an IQ of one hundred is an average adult. If we say that a man with an IQ of eighty becomes responsible, then we are by definition saying that a man with an IQ of seventy-nine is not responsible – is that a clear, fair, and utterly objective demarcation? Certainly not, but in order for most concepts to be practical, the criterion of “good enough” and a reasonable cost/benefit analysis must be put into place. As mentioned above, no water is perfectly pure, but waiting for perfect purity would simply cause a man to die of thirst.

Given that the question of moral responsibility and intellectual capacity only applies to a very small percentage of people right on the border, and that creating objective and perfect tests is very likely to prove impossible, there will inevitably be some “rules of thumb” that win the day. We can only assume that, since biologists live with this kind of occasional subjectivism every day, moral philosophers can somehow survive as well.

### Property As Universality

UPB thus gives us clear options with regards to property rights. It cannot be the case that some men have property rights, while other men do not. It cannot be the case that men in Washington have property rights, while women in Baltimore do not. It cannot be the case that men have property rights today, but not tomorrow, and so on.

It also cannot be the case that men have only fifty percent property rights.

If I argue: “Men only have fifty percent property rights,” then I create yet another insurmountable contradiction. You may well ask me which half of my sentence was *not* generated by me. If I only have fifty percent property rights, then clearly I only have fifty percent control over my own body – if I put forward the above sentence, then clearly I am only in control of fifty percent of that sentence, since I only have fifty percent control over my voice. Who, then, is responsible for the other fifty percent of my sentence?

This may sound esoteric, but it is a deadly serious question, for reasons that we will get to shortly.

Let us say that we can somehow magically bypass the “fifty percent ownership of the body” problem, and say that human beings only have fifty percent property rights when it comes to *external* objects.

How does that work in practice?

Well, if I have two lawnmowers and you have none, then clearly it would be logical for you to have the right to take one of my lawnmowers, since I can only ever own half of my lawnmower collection.

However, when you take possession of one of my lawnmowers, unfortunately you are only ever allowed to own *half* of that lawnmower, since we only have the right to fifty percent ownership over external objects. Thus you must immediately find somebody with whom you can share the lawnmower. This brings your “just” ownership down to twenty-five percent. However, your new co-owner cannot have the right to twenty-five percent of the lawnmower, because he only has fifty percent rights for whatever ownership he possesses – thus he must find somebody to take fifty percent of the twenty-five percent that he has – and so on and so on and so on.

The problem with any theory that argues for less than one hundred percent property rights is that it instantly creates a “domino effect” of infinite regression, wherein everybody ends up with infinitely small ownership rights over pretty much everything, which is clearly impossible. Thus it must be the case – both logically and practically – that we have full ownership over our own bodies, and over the effects of our bodies, in terms of external property. We do not need a homesteading theory, or other “just acquisition” approaches to justify property rights – they are justified because anybody who acts in any way, shape or form – including arguing – is axiomatically exercising one hundred percent control over his own body, and “homesteading” both oxygen and sound waves in order to make his case.

Thus, by combining this axiomatic reality with UPB, we can easily understand that since anyone debating property rights is exercising one hundred percent control over his own property, the only question is whether or not property rights vary from individual to individual – a question definitively settled by the axiomatic fact of self-ownership, as well as the UPB framework. Any moral proposition must be universal and consistent, and this is how we also know that *everyone* has one hundred percent property rights.

Any other possibility is logically and empirically impossible.

### Testing "Theft"

Revenons à nos patients moraux cobayes, Bob et Doug.
Si le vol est moralement bon, alors une fois encore, nous sommes confrontés au problème de l'impossibilité de la traduction simultanée de la moralité. Si Bob a un briquet, et il est moralement bon à voler, puis Doug doit voler Bob est plus léger. Toutefois, dès l'instant que Doug est en train de voler Bob est encore plus léger, Bob ne peut pas lui-même être moral. Le moment *après* Doug vole son briquet, Bob doit voler “son” plus léger arrière – cependant, c'est seulement le “vol” si le briquet est *pas* légitimement Bob en premier lieu. Lorsque Doug vole Bob est encore plus léger, le plus léger n'est pas légitimement devenir Doug propriété, sinon la notion de vol, n'aurait aucun sens. Si, le moment où j'ai voler quelque chose, il devient mon légitime de la propriété, puis restitution deviendrait elle-même le vol d'. Si, cependant, je ne suis *pas* d'établir la propriété légitime par le vol Bob est plus léger, il est clair qu'il est impossible pour le Bob à “voler” le plus léger *retour*, parce que nous ne pouvons pas voler ce que nous avons déjà, et mon vol n'a pas invalidé Bob est la propriété de son briquet.

Ainsi, si le vol est bonne, alors la bonté devient un état réalisable seulement à l'instant que Doug vole Bob est plus léger. En cet instant, seulement Doug peut être morale, et Bob ne peut pas être. Après cela, la bonté devient impossible à réaliser pour l'une ou l'autre partie, à moins que Doug continue à Bob léger en arrière et puis arrachant loin encore.

Bien sûr, il semble ridicule de s'imaginer que l'idéal moral de l'état est pour un homme de continuer à donner un autre homme à l'arrière de la propriété qu'il a volé, et puis immédiatement à voler de nouveau. Ainsi, la logique semble valider notre compréhension instinctive de la folie de ce comme un idéal moral – mais nous allons aller un peu plus loin, pour voir si elle tient toujours.

Rappelez-vous, nous ne sommes pas particulièrement concernée par les criminels, mais plutôt avec la morale des théories pour justifier les violations des droits de propriété. Par exemple, si Doug vole Bob est plus facile parce que Doug estime que “Pas de droits de propriété valide”, puis Doug théorie morale instantanément auto-explose.

Si aucun des droits de propriété valide, puis de voler est complètement illogique d'action, puisque le vol est une affirmation de la volonté de contrôle de la propriété.

Droits de propriété eux-mêmes ne sont rien de plus que l'affirmation d'un désir de garder le contrôle sur les actifs. Il est facultatif, dans la mesure où vous et je peux rejoindre certains hippie de la commune, et décider de ne plus jamais faire valoir nos droits de propriété. Ou, si elle devient connue dans mon quartier, que je suis plus qu'heureux si quelqu'un prend ma propriété, il semble un peu plus susceptibles que ma tondeuse à gazon va aller manquant. De même, si je mets un ordinateur portable sur ma pelouse avec un signe en disant: “toi si tu le veux”, alors que je suis clairement comprendre que je n'ai aucun désir de maintenir l'actuel ou futur de contrôle sur l'ordinateur portable.

Si Doug vole Bob est plus léger, c'est parce que Doug a un désir de prendre le contrôle sur le briquet – ce qui est la définition même des droits de propriété. Si Doug vole Bob est plus facile parce que Doug estime que les droits de propriété ne sont pas valides, puis ce qu'il est en train de dire: “je veux prendre le contrôle de Bob plus léger, car il n'est jamais valide pour reprendre le contrôle de n'importe quel objet.”

Si Doug ne voler Bob est plus léger, mais défend alors son vol grâce à un rejet de droits de propriété, il est clair que Doug ne peut pas opposer à Bob de prendre son briquet arrière – puisque les droits de propriété ne sont pas valides, Doug a maintenant plus aucune demande valide pour propre le plus léger que Bob. Enfin, si Doug vole Bob est plus léger, selon le principe “le vol est la bonne,” il est clair que Doug n'ont pas pu logique d'objection à quelqu'un d'autre de voler le plus léger immédiatement. Cependant, il serait précieux que peu de sens pour Doug passer du temps et de l'énergie voler Bob est plus léger si au moment où il l'avait en son chaud les petites mains, quelqu'un d'autre l'a saisi loin de lui. En d'autres termes, le travail à prendre le contrôle d'un morceau de la propriété n'est valable que si vous pouvez faire valoir vos droits de propriété sur l'objet volé. Aucun homme ne se donnera la peine de voler un porte-monnaie si il a la certitude qu'il sera volé de lui au moment où il obtient ses mains sur elle.
En d'autres termes, le vol, dans la pratique, est à la fois une affirmation de droits de propriété et un déni des droits de propriété. Toute théorie morale qui prend en charge le vol ainsi à la fois affirme et nie l'existence de droits de propriété – une insurmontable contradiction qui a complètement invalide toute cette théorie.
Si l'on regarde les aspects moraux du communisme, par exemple, les droits de propriété sont explicitement refusé pour l'individu. Toutefois, ces personnes qui se font appeler “le gouvernement” ne revendiquer le droit de propriété du contrôle. Ce que cela signifie dans la pratique, c'est qu'il est *mal* pour certains hommes, de contrôle de la propriété, mais il est *bien* pour d'autres hommes pour le contrôle de la propriété. Depuis il n'y a pas de distinction biologique en termes d'espèces, entre le souverain et les gouvernés, nous pouvons clairement voir qu'ici, pour la même espèce, nous avons complètement à l'opposé de règles de morale, qui ne peut pas être valable. La REMONTÉE explicitement des exigences morales, les règles soient les mêmes pour tous les hommes, en tous lieux et à tout moment – dire qu'il est immoral de Ivan Denisovich à l'exercice de ses droits de propriété – mais *morale* pour Joseph Staline à l'exercice de *son* droits de propriété – crée un rang contradiction, qui s'apparente à dire que verser de l'eau dans une piscine à la fois la remplit et se vide en même temps. Tout physicien qui a proposé ce dernier aurait ri de sa profession – moralistes, cependant, de proposer régulièrement de l'ancienne, et sont accueillis avec de mystérieuses niveaux de respect.
