## Etik Kategoriler

UPB 'nin sahadaki yapısı ile, şimdi UPB 'nin en yaygın ahlaki savlarımızı nasıl doğruladığının veya geçersiz kıldığının bir incelemesine bakabiliriz. Eğer ''fizik teori''miz bir insanın beysbol topunu nasıl yakalayabildiğini açıklayabiliyorsa, canavara karşı en azından ilk -ve en önemli- engeli aşmış ve ilk en büyük darbemizi yapmışızdır.

### Yedi Kategori

As mentioned above, propositions regarding universally preferable behaviour fall into three general categories – positive, negative and neutral. To help us separate aesthetics from ethics, let us start by widening these categories to encompass *any* behaviour that can be subjected to an ethical analysis. These seven categories are:

1. Bu iyi (evrensel olarak tercih edilebilir ve şiddet yoluyla uygulanabilir, örneğin "cinayet işlemeyin").
2. It is aesthetically positive (universally preferable but not enforceable through violence, such as “politeness” and “being on time”).
3. It is personally positive (neither universally preferable nor enforceable, such a predilection for eating ice cream).
4. It is neutral, or has no ethical or aesthetic content, such as running for a bus.
5. It is personally negative (predilection for not eating ice cream).
6. Estetik olarak negatif ("edepsizlik" ve "geç kalmak").
7. Bu kötü (evrensel olarak yasaklanmış) ("tecavüz").

Ideally, we should be able to whittle these down to only two categories – universally preferable and aesthetically positive – by defining our ethical propositions so that what is universally banned is simply a mirror image of what is universally preferable, and ditching merely personal preferences and neutral actions as irrelevant to a discussion of ethics.

For instance, the Non-Aggression Principle (NAP) states that the initiation of the use of force is immoral – thus the non-initiation of the use of force is universally preferable, while the initiation of the use of force is universally banned. Eğer yasaklanan şey tercih edilen şeyin tam tersi ise, bunun için fazladan bir kategoriye gerek yoktur.

Ayrıca ahlaki filozoflar olarak, en acımasız ihlallere odaklanarak rasyonel etiğin incelemesine öncelik vermeliyiz. Clearly, the most immoral actions must be the violent enforcement of unjust preferences upon others. If actions such as “theft” or “murder” are defined as UPB, the examination of such definitions must be our very highest priority.

Böylece, çabalarımızı öncelikle evrensel olarak tercih edilen ve uygulanabilir eylemler üzerinde yoğunlaştıracağız.

### Virtue And Its Opposite

The opposite of “virtue” must be “vice” – the opposite of “good” must be “evil.” If I propose the moral rule, “thou shalt not steal,” then stealing must be evil, and *not* stealing must be good. This does not mean that “refraining from theft” is the sole definition of moral excellence, of course, since a man may be a murderer, but not a thief. We can think of it as a “necessary but not sufficient” requirement for virtue.

Each morally preferable action must by its very nature have an opposite action – because if it does not, then there is no capacity for choice, no possibility of avoidance, and therefore no capacity for virtue or vice. If I propose the moral rule: “thou shalt defy gravity,” then clearly morality becomes impossible, immorality cannot be avoided, and therefore the moral rule must be invalid.

If I propose the moral rule: “thou shalt not go to San Francisco,” this can be logically rephrased as: “thou shalt go anywhere but San Francisco.” In this way, the moral rule “thou shalt not steal” can be equally proposed in the positive form – “thou shalt respect property rights.” Since respecting property rights is a virtue, violating property rights must be a vice.

### What Is Missing

Conspicuously absent from the above list are traditional virtues such as courage, honesty, integrity and so on – as well as their opposites: cowardice, falsehood and corruption.

It may seem that these virtues should fall into the realm of aesthetically positive behaviour, such as being on time, but I for one have far too much respect for the traditional virtues to place them in the same category as social niceties. The reason that they cannot be placed into the category of universally preferable is that, as we mentioned above, the framework of UPB only deals with *behaviours*, not with attitudes, thoughts, states of mind or emotions. The scientific method can process a logical proposition; it cannot process “anger” or “foolhardiness.” These states of mind are not unimportant, of course – in fact, they are essential – but they cannot be part of any objective system for evaluating ethical propositions, since they are essentially subjective – and therefore unprovable – states of being.

Thus UPB can only deal with objectively verifiable actions such as murder, assault and so on.
