## Varoluş Varolmayışa Karşı

"Var olmayışı", kütle veya enerjiye sahip olmayan olarak tanımlarız veya kütlenin veya enerjinin etkilerini gösteririz, örneğin saptanabilir etkileşimleri olan yerçekimi gibi.

Tanrı kütle veya enerjiye sahip değildir ya da kütlenin veya enerjinin etkilerini göstermez - Tanrı, aslında, duyular yoluyla veya akılcılık yoluyla hiçbir şekilde saptanabilir ya da doğrulanabilir değildir.

Bu yüzden eğer “Tanrı var” dersem, gerçekte söylediğim şudur:

“*Var olanın saptanabilir olması gerekir; Tanrı saptanamaz, ancak Tanrı vardır - bu nedenle Tanrı, varolmayan, vardır.*”

Başka bir deyişle, “Tanrı var” diyerek, aşılmaz bir çelişki oluşturdum. “Varoluşu”u, “varolmayış” olarak tanımladım, “hayatı”, “cansız madde” veya “kayayı”, “kayanın zıddı” olarak ya da “kare”yi, “daire” olarak tanımlamak ne kadar mantıklıysa, bu da o kadar mantıklıdır.

Benzer şekilde, “varolmayışın varoluşa eşit olduğu”,  “çelişkinin tutarlılığa eşit olduğu”, “hakikatin sahteye eşit olduğu” ve “mantıksızlığın akılcı olmaya eşit olduğu” alternatif bir evren yaratırsam, gerçekte yaptıpım şey; “yanlış” adı verilen bir yer yaratıp, doğru olmayan her şeyi onun içine koymak ve bu yeri “yanlış doğruya eşittir” şeklinde tanımlamaktır.[^2]

Elbette ki, insanlar kendi evrenimizdeki gerçeği geçersiz kılmak için bu “alternatif evren”i yaratmazlar, fakat gerçekte yanlış olanı kurtarıp doğru olarak adlandırılar. Örneğin,“Tanrı başka bir evrende var olabilir, bu nedenle Tanrı'nın var olmadığını iddia edemezsiniz” diyen hiç kimse; “*Ben* diğer evrende olmayabilirim, bu yüzden burada olduğumu söyleyemezsiniz.” iddiasında bulunamaz.

Ayrıca şu argümana karşı iyi bir cevap vermeme eğilimindedirler: “Başka bir evrende, Tanrı'nın var olmadığı konusunda benimle anlaşıyor olabilirsiniz, bu sizi ateist yapar.”[^3]

“Yanlış doğruya eşittir” denilen bazı hayali bölger onları geçersiz kıldığı için, gerçeğe ilişkin geçerli ifadeler,  sonsuza kadar tersi olabiliyorsa, gerçekte söylenen şu ki “hakikatle ilgili olumlu bir ifade geçerli olamaz” - ancak bu ifadenin kendisiyle çelişkili olduğunu bilmek için filozoflar kadar aklıyız, zira bu, olumlu ifadelerin doğru olamayacağını söyleyen, doğru olduğu düşünülen olumlu bir beyandır. Hiçbir şey doğru veya yanlış olamıyorsa - hatta bu ifade bile - o zaman herhangi bir şey hakkında hiçbir ifade edilemez. Kelimeleri kullanma, İngilizceyi kullanmak, anlaşılır cümleler kullanmak - hepsi anlamsızdır, çünkü bu “alternatif evren”de böyle yapılandırılmış sözler tamamen saçmalık olabilir. Bu alternatif evrende doğru olabilecek şeyler, bu evrende yaptığımız açıklamalar üzerinde bir etkiye sahipse, açıkça tersi de doğrudur; bu, tam tersinin eşit derecede geçerli olabileceği için herhangi bir şey hakkında hiçbir ifade edilemez demektir.

“Yanlış doğruya eşittir” açıklamasının gerçekte doğrusu, “hiçlik hiçliğe eşittir” şeklinde totolojik bir saçmalıktır.

### İnsan Toplumunda "Alternatif Evren"

Bu “alternatif evren” teorisi ile çok fazla zaman harcamamızın nedeni, bunun insan topluluğuyla doğrudan alakalı olması ve aramızdaki en büyük kötülükleri “haklı kılmak” için kullanılmasıdır.

Kendi kişisel deneyimlerimizden, cinayetin yanlış olduğunu biliyoruz. Yukarıdaki örneklerde cinayetin ahlaki açıdan yanlış olduğunu öne sürmeye çalışırken, herhangi birinin, UPB'nin sıkı soyut akıl yürütme yöntemiyle ahlaki içgüdülerinizi doğrulamak için şok olduğundan şüpheliyim. Ancak bu bölümde resmen şok olmaya başlayabilirsiniz.

Bilimsel anlayıştaki en büyük atılım, sözde “kuramların birleştirişmesi”dir. Einstein on yıllar boyunca birleşik bir alan teorisi geliştirmeye çalışıtı; güçlü ve zayıf kuvvetleri, elektromanyetizma, yerçekimi ve benzer fizik teorilerilerini birleştirmek hala 
 zor olmaya devam ediyor.

Bununla birlikte, bir çerçeve olarak UPB, ahlaki içgüdülerimizi kişisel, felsefi ve evrensel düzeyde haklı kılmakla kalmaz  – aynı zamanda insan toplumu için derin ve şok edici etkilere sahiptir.

#### Eylemde UPB

UPB çerçevesi ahlaki önermeleri, iç tutarlı olmalarını talep ederek doğrular ve zaman, mekan ve birey açısından evrenseldir.

UPB'yi kabul edersek, aşağıdaki sonuçları da kabul etmeliyiz:

- Ahlaki önermeler kostümden bağımsızdır.

Bunun anlamı; bir adam, ahlaki duruşunu, elbilseleriyle değiştiremez demektir. Birinin kostümünü değiştirme eylemi o kişinin temel niteliğini değiştirmez. Dolayısıyla, karşıt ahlaki kurallar, birinin giydiği kıyafetlere dayanarak geçerli olamaz.

Askerler tabii ki, sıradan vatandaştan farklı kostüm giyerler. Ortalama vatandaşa cinayet yasaktır; bununla birlikte, askerlere *izin* verilen sadece ödürmek değildir fakat öldürdükleri için ahlaki olarak *övülürler*.

Başka bir örnek verelim.

Yukarıda gördüğümüz gibi, hırsızlık ahlaki olarak yanlıştır. Bu, tüm insanlar için her durumda ve koşulda ahlaki açıdan yanlıştır. Hırsızlık, başka birinin mülkünün rızası olmadan zorla alınması olduğundan, vergilendirme daima, evrensel ve sonsuza kadar ahlaki bir kötülüktür. Vergilendirme, tanımı gereği, rızası olmadan birinin mülkünün zorla alınmasına neden olur; zira vergilendirme, bir adamın mülkünü soymak için kuvvet kullanımının başlatılmasına dayanır.

“Hükümet” olarak adlandırdığımız şey, yukarının aşağı, siyahın beyaz, doğrunun yanlış, kötülüğün iyilik olduğu bu *hiçbir şey alanı*nın bir başka örneğidir.

Toplum; tam olarak, sebeplerin ve kanıtların kişiselden evrensele doğru büyük bir sıçrama yaptığı seviyede ve yolundaki mantıksız *hiçbir şey alanları*nı yok ederek ilerliyor. Bilim tam olarak Tanrı'nın mantıksızlığını ve öznel “mutlakları” reddetme derecesinde ilerlemektedir. Tıp, ibadetin ve boş ritüelin etkinliğini reddetme ve bunun yerine akıl ve kanıtlara dayanma yolunda ilerlemektedir. Ayrıca felsefe - ve genel olarak insan toplumu -, “kare-daire ahlakı” mantıksızlığındaki devletçi ve dini etik teorileri reddetme derecesine ilerleyecektir.

### Hükümet

Hükümetin toplumun geri kalanına karşı ahlaki kurallarla faaliyet gösterdiğini söylemek “leprechaun adlı cüce cinler yerçekiminden etkilenmez” demekle tamamen aynıdır. Her şeyden önce, masal kahramanı olan leprechaun adlı cüce cinler yoktur - ve olmadığını bilme yollarımızdan birisi de yerçekiminden muaf oldukları iddiasıdır. Kütlesi olan her şey yerçekimine tabidir - tanımı gereği yerçekiminden etkilenmeyenin kütlesi yoktur ve bu nedenle mevcut değildir. “Leprechaun'lar yerçekimine karşı bağışıktır” ifadesi, sadece leprechaun'ların varlığını doğrulayan bir totolojidir - “var olmayan varoluşun" semantik karşılığıdır. A, A'dır, Aristo'nun ilk mantık yasasıdır, yokluk olarak tanımlanmışın varlığını doğrulamak onu değersizleştirir.

Aynı şekilde, askerler için öldürmek ve hükümet temsilcileri için çalmanın alhlaki olarak iyi olduğunu söylediğimizde, biliyoruz ki "askerler" ve "hükümet temsilcileri" ahlaki kategori olarak *tamamen geçersizdir*.

Kare şeklindeki bir çemberin çalmaya hakkı olduğunu söylüyorsam, aslında sadece şunu söylüyorum; var olmayanın kendiyle çelişme hakkı vardır - bu tamamen saçma bir ifadedir ama siyasetin “hiçbir şey alanı”'nda garip bir şekilde çekici kalıyor.

İkinci el dükkânında bir askerin kıyafetini alıp giyersem, açıktır ki karşıt ahlaki kuralların geçerli olduğu alternatif bir evren yaratmış olmam. Kostümü giymeden önce, öldürmek benim için yanlıştı - öldürmek benim için zaman ne zaman *doğru* haline gelir? Pantolonu giydiğim zaman? Pantolonumu giyseydim, ama yeleği giymesem ne olurdu? Sadece bir tek botum varsa? Peki ya her iki bot da ayağımdaysa, ama sadece birisi bağlanmışsa? Şapkam geriye doğru giderse ne olur? Karşılaştığım ilk kişi tarafından tanınmayan üniforma giyseydim ne olurdu? Beatles, “Sergeant Peppers” kapağının çekimlerinde birdenbire öldürme hakkına sahip olmuş muydu? Ceketlerini çıkarırken haklarını kaybettiler mi?

Aslında ölümcül derece ciddi oldukları için bu retorik sorularu soruyorum. Açıkça görülüyor ki, askeri bir kostüm insan doğasını değiştirmez; bir saç kesimi onu ördek, konspet ya da bir tanrı haline dönüştürmek başka bir şey değildir.

Belki “Aa,” diyorsun, "ama kostüm geçersiz çünkü ikinci el dükkânında buluyorsun - asker üniformasını giymek seni asker yapmaz öyle olsaydı doktora fotokopisi sana Dr. ünvanını kazandırırdı"

Benzetme yanlış, çünkü doktora derecesine veya doktora fotokopisine sahip olmak, insan olarak tabi tutulduğunuz ahlaki kurallardan hiçbirini değiştirmez.

“Eh,” deyip, “ancak fark, askerin; toplu savunma yapması için, normal vatandaşların kendisine sağladığı ahlaki haklara sahip olmasıdır” diye yanıtlayabilirsiniz.

Burada çok ilginç bir nokta ortaya çıkarıyor, bu görüşlerin gerçekliği değiştirip değiştiremeyeceği sorusudur.

### Görüşler ve Gerçek

Açıkça anlıyoruz ki, görüşlerim sayesinde sizi yerçekimi kısıtlamalarından kurtaramam, bu benim görüşümün, "iki artı iki beşe eşittir"i doğru yapmasından öte bir şey değildir.

“Fikirler”, gerçekte açık bir delile sahip olmayan veya açık bir delil sağlanamayan ya da sadece kişisel tercihlerin ifadeleri olan inançlardır. Kişisel görüşüm çikolatalı dondurmayı vanilyalıya tercih etmemdir - İzlanda'nın tropikal bir cennet olduğuna veya Tanrı'nın varlığına ya da yağmurun yukarı doğru yağdığına dair bir “görüşüm” olabilir. Kişisel görüşlerin açıkça ahlak ile hiçbir ilgisi yoktur; gerçekliği doğru bir şekilde tanımladığını iddia eden görüşler ancak yanlış önyargılardır. Yağmurun yukarı doğru yağdığına olan inanç onun yönünü tersine çevirmez; İzlanda'da Hawaii gömleği giymek Reykjavik'i daha sıcak yapmaz.

Dolayısıyla cinayetin ahlaki açıdan iyi olduğuna inanmak, cinayeti ahlaki açıdan iyi yapmaz. İnsana ilişkin inancım onun ahlaki yapısını değiştirmediğinden, cinayetlerinin erdemli olduğuna olan inanmam onun eylemlerinin erdem şeklini değiştirmez. Gözlerimi kapatır ve sizin bir kertenkele olduğunuzu düşünürsem, aniden kendi vücut ısınızı düzenleme yeteneğinizi kaybetmezsiniz. Bir balık olduğunuzu hayal etmek, tüplü dalış kıyafeti ihtiyacınızı ortadan kaldırmaz.

Görüşler gerçekliği değiştirmez.

Görüşler gerçekliği değiştirmediğinden, Evrensel bir ahlaki kuralla ilgili olarak size herhangi bir istisna veya tersine çevirme hakkı veremem. Ahlaki kurallar evrensel mantığa dayandığı için hemde insanlığın gerçekliği ve fiziksel yapısı gereği, size, bir söyleyişinizle iki artı ikinin beş olması veya su üstünde yürüme, uçma yeteneği veremediğim gibi “öldürme hakkı” da veremem.

### Gönüllülük Hükümeti

Devlet kurumunda yer alan açık kuvvetler - belirli bir grup birey için ahlaki kuralları tersine çeviren kavramsal sarıcı - tartışma ortamında daima masanın üzerinde duran bir şeydir. Hükümet hakkında konuşurken, "Odadaki silahı" belirtmek için asla olumlu bir şey olarak görülmemelidir. Neredeyse tanım gereği, hükümetler, halk için ve halk tarafından seçilmiş sayılır, ve açık veya kapalı onayları ile çalışır.

Ancak, bu katıksız saçmalıktır.

Bir erkek, bir kadının boğazına bıçak tuturak onunla seks yapıyorsa, bu herhangi bir tanımla tecavüz demektir. Onunla seks yapmayı reddederse, yaralama ya da ölümle tehdit ediyorken, seksin rıza ile olduğunu söyleyemez. Seks gönüllü ise bıçak tamamen gereksizdir. Adam bir bıçağa ihtiyaç duyuyorsa, bu açıkça gönüllü bir seks *değildir*

Benzer şekilde, insanlar vergilemenin gönüllü olarak kabul ettikleri sosyal sözleşmenin bir parçası olduğunu söylüyorlar.

Bu mantıksal ve ampirik olarak iki türlü de yanlıştır.

Ampirik olarak yanlış olduğunu biliyoruz çünkü böyle bir *sosyal sözleşme yok*. Ne siz ne de ben gönüllü olarak gelir vergisine razı olduğumuz gösteren bir belgeyi *hiçbir zaman* imzalamak - biz sadece silahı işaret ederek bizden paramızı alan alan bir sistemde doğduk.

### Odadaki Silah

Çok kişi, bu noktada, vergilendirmenin silah zoruyla olmadığını, daha çok kişilerin gönüllü olarak ödediklerini öne sürecektir. Örneğin bir vergi toplaycısı veya bir polis memuru tarafından yüzüme doğrultulan bir silah olmadı, ancak on yıllarca vergilerimi ödemiştim.

Bu doğru olabilir, ancak tamamen alakasızdır. Bir kadına, benimle seks yapmazsa çocuklarını öldüreceğimi söylersem ve bana kendisini gelirse, ahlaki olmayan bir eylemin gerçekleştiğini açıkça anlıyoruz – tecavüzüm sırasında silah kullanmamama rağmen. Clearly, if the woman submits to me, it is because she fears that I will carry out my threat. If I told her that my pet leprechaun will kill her children if she does not have sex with me, she would very likely be disturbed, but would not fear my threat in any significant way, since it is impossible for my pet leprechaun to kill her children. Or, if I died, and my will stated that I would kill this woman’s children if she did not have sex with me, clearly she would feel relieved rather than afraid, since I cannot conceivably act out my threat from beyond the grave. Thus we pay taxes because we know that if we do not, the likelihood of being aggressed against by representatives of the state is very high. If I do not pay my taxes, I will get a letter, then another letter, then a phone call, then a summons to court – and if I do not appear in court, or do not pay my back taxes and accumulated fines and interest, policemen will come with guns to take me to jail. If I resist those policemen, they will shoot me down.

To say that force equals voluntarism is completely illogical and self-contradictory. To say that the initiation of the use of force is completely equal to the non-initiation of the use of force is to say that up is down, black is white, and truth is falsehood.

Without the “null zone,” these corrupt fictions cannot be sustained.

The “null zone” is the lair of the beast we hunt.

As we can see, we know that personally it is wrong to steal; we have very few problems with an abstract and logical ban on theft, such as we have worked out above – yet still, there exists this “null zone” or alternate universe where such oppositions can be accepted without any question or concern.

According to UPB, it is wrong for me and you to steal. Yet somehow, in this “null zone,” it is not only allowed, but also perfectly *moral*, for others to steal. We *must not* steal – they *must* steal. It is moral madness!

### Policemen

Let us take our good friend Bob away from his little room of moral theory testing and restore him to his original job as a policeman.

Clearly, when Bob wakes up in the morning, before his shift, he cannot go to his neighbour’s house and demand money at the point of a gun, no matter who tells him that it’s all right.

When Bob has his breakfast, he also cannot attack his neighbour and take his money. On his drive to work – even though he has put on his uniform – he has not punched in yet, and thus has no more rights than any other citizen. When he punches in, however, now, as if there descends an amoral pillar of fire from the very heavens, he gains the amazing ability to morally attack his neighbours and take their money.

Strangely, this is the only characteristic of his that has utterly reversed itself. He cannot fly, he cannot change his shape, he cannot successfully digest ball bearings or live in an inferno; he cannot run one thousand kilometres an hour, and neither can he walk through a brick wall. He is absolutely, utterly, and completely *the same man as he was **before** he punched in* – yet now, he is subject to completely opposite moral rules.

Even more strangely, if I am not a “policeman,” but I follow Bob to work, and do exactly what he does – I put on a costume, walk into the police station, and put a piece of cardboard into a punch clock – why, if I then do exactly what Bob does, I am completely and totally immoral, although Bob’s identical actions are completely and totally *moral*.

What kind of sense does this make? How can we conceivably unravel this impenetrable mystery?

The simple fact is that it *cannot* be unravelled, because it is completely deranged. The fact that this “opposite world” moral madness is completely irrational – not to mention violently exploitive – is so obvious that it must be buried in an endless cavalcade of mythological “voluntarism.”

We are told that we “want” Bob to take our money – which completely contradicts the fact that Bob shows up on our doorstep pointing a loaded gun in our face. By this logic, I can also go up and down the street stealing money from my neighbours, and then claim to be utterly shocked when I am arrested:

“They *want* me to take their money!”

“But then why were you threatening to shoot them if they did not give you their money?”

“Because they *owe* me their money!”

“I thought you said that they want to give you their money.”

“No, no – they owe me. It’s really *my* money!”

“On what grounds do they owe you this money?”

“We have a contract!”

“Can you show me this contract? Have they signed this contract of their own free will?”

“It’s not that kind of contract! It’s a – *social* contract… And besides – according to that social contract, I own the whole street anyway – the whole damn neighbourhood in fact! Anyone who refuses to pay me my money can move somewhere else – I’m not forcing anyone!”

“And how do you know that you own the whole neighbourhood? Do you have ownership papers?”

“Yes, of course – have a look here!”

“Well, this is just a handwritten note saying that you own the whole neighbourhood – and it’s the same handwriting as your signature. I’m afraid that we’re going to have to book you – this is just a made-up contract with yourself, which you are inflicting on other people at the point of a gun.”

This is as completely insane and corrupt as me continuing to tell a woman I am raping that she *wants* to have sex with me. Can you imagine if I were on trial for rape, and there was a videotape of the woman begging me to stop, and I had a knife to her throat, how my defence would be received if I continued to insist that she actually *wanted* to have sex with me?

In court, I would be reviled, and thrown into jail for my obvious, mad, corrupt and self-serving hypocrisy.

Ah, but in the “null zone” of government, rape is lovemaking, kidnapping is invitation, rejecting theft is evil selfishness, and coercion is kindness.

This is what I mean when I say that this “opposite world *null zone*” is the most fundamental barrier to human happiness the world over. Stealing is wrong for us; stealing is wrong in the abstract – but stealing is somehow “right” in this insane alternate universe called “government”?

### Practicality

Once the violence of government is intellectually exposed – and the supposed “voluntarism” of citizens is revealed as a vicious fraud – the argument always comes back that we *need* government to supply us with public goods such as protection, regional defence, roads etc.

I have written dozens of articles exposing the falsehood of this position, so I will not bother to reiterate those arguments here, since they are not essential to a book on morality, but rather would be more appropriate to a book explaining the principles and practicalities of a voluntary society.[^4]

The “argument from practicality” in no way solves the problem of violence. If I see you eating cheeseburgers every day, I can tell you that it is impractical for you to do so, if you want to maintain a healthy weight. I cannot claim that it is *evil* for you to eat cheeseburgers, for reasons that we have gone into already. I cannot justly compel you through force to increase the “practicality” of your actions.

Thus saying that the government is justified in forcing us to become more “practical” is completely false, which is verified by the UPB framework – even if we assume that government solutions are more “practical,” which in fact they are not.

Also, if government representatives claim that a social contract allows them to force an “impractical” population to behave more “practically,” an insurmountable contradiction is created.

If I force a woman to marry a man I have chosen for her, then clearly I believe that I have infinitely better judgement about the suitability of a husband for her than she does. In fact, I do not believe that she is open to reason at all, or has any clue about her own self-interest, because I am taking *no* account of her preferences, but am forcing her to marry a man of my choosing.

When I force this woman to get married, I can only justify the use of force – even on immediate, pragmatic grounds – by claiming that she is mentally unfit to make her own choices with regards to marriage.

If the woman is mentally unfit to make her own choices with regards to marriage, then clearly she is also *mentally unfit to delegate a representative to make that choice for her*. If she has no idea what constitutes a good or suitable husband, then how can she evaluate me as fit to decide who will be a good or suitable husband for her?

If a man of extraordinarily low intelligence does not understand the concept of “health,” would it be reasonable to expect him to be rational in his choice of a doctor? In order to competently choose a doctor, we must understand the concepts of health, efficacy, cost, professionalism and so on. In the same way, if I do not allow a woman to have any say in who she marries, then clearly I must believe that she has no understanding of what makes a good husband – but if she has no understanding of what makes a good husband, then she has no capacity to transfer that choice to me, since she will have no way of evaluating *my* criteria for what makes a good husband.

If I cannot decide what colour to paint my house, and my solution is to sign a contract with a painter allowing him to choose the colour for me – and in that contract I sign away all my future freedoms to resist his decisions, and give him the right to kidnap and enslave me if I disagree with any of his decisions, or refuse to pay for them – then clearly I am not of sound mind. If I give someone the power to compel me *for the rest of my life*, then clearly I do not believe that I am competent to make my own decisions.

If I do not think that I am competent to make my own decisions, then clearly my decision to subject myself to violence *for the rest of my life* is an incompetent decision.

Either I am capable of making competent decisions, or I am not. If I *am* capable of making competent decisions, then subjecting myself to force for the rest of my life is invalid. If I am *not* capable of making competent decisions, then my decision to subject myself to force for the rest of my life is also invalid.

Even if the above considerations are somehow bypassed, however, it is still impossible to justly enforce a social contract through a government. Clearly, I cannot sign a contract on *your* behalf, or on my children’s behalf, which will be binding upon you or them for the rest of time. I cannot buy a car, send you the bill, and justly demand that you pay it. If I claim the power to impose unilateral contracts on you, UPB also grants *you* this power, and so you will just return the contract to me in my name.

In the same way, even if I choose to pay my taxes voluntarily, I cannot justly impose that choice upon you, since a voluntary contract is a merely personal preference, and so cannot be universally enforced through violence.

### The Necessity Of The State?

This whole question becomes even more ludicrous when we look at the most common moral “justification” for the power of democratic governments, which is based upon the “will of the majority.”

First of all, “will” is an aspect of the individual, while “majority” is a conceptual tag for a group. The “majority” can no more have a “will” than a “chorus line” can “give birth.” If you doubt this, just try building a tree house with the concept “forest” rather than with any individual pieces of wood.

Two additional objections constantly recur whenever the question of the necessity of a government arises. The first is that a free society is only possible if people are perfectly good or rational – in other words, that citizens *need* a centralised government because there are evil people in the world.

The first and most obvious problem with this position is that if evil people exist in society, they will also exist within the government – and be far more dangerous thereby. Citizens can protect themselves against evil individuals, but stand no chance against an aggressive government armed to the teeth with police and military might. Thus the argument that we need the government because evil people exist is false. If evil people exist, the government *must* be dismantled, since evil people will be drawn to use its power for their own ends – and, unlike private thugs, evil people in government have the police and military to inflict their whims on a helpless (and relatively disarmed) population. Thus the argument is akin to the idea that “counterfeiters are very dangerous, so we should provide an exclusive monopoly over counterfeiting to a small group of individuals.” Where on earth do people think the counterfeiters will go first?[^5]

Logically, there are four possibilities as to the mixture of good and evil people in the world:

1. All men are moral.
2. All men are immoral.
3. The majority of men are immoral, and a minority moral.
4. The majority of men are moral, and a minority immoral.[^6]

In the first case (*all men are moral*), the government is obviously not needed, since evil cannot exist.

In the second case (*all men are immoral*), the government cannot be permitted to exist for one simple reason. The government, it is generally argued, must exist because there are evil people in the world who desire to inflict harm, and who can only be restrained through fear of government retribution (police, prisons, *et al*). A corollary of this argument is that the less retribution these people fear, the more evil they will do.

However, the government *itself* is not subject to any force or retribution, but is a law unto itself. Even in Western democracies, how many policemen and politicians go to jail?

Thus if evil people wish to do harm, but are only restrained by force, then society can *never* permit a government to exist, because evil people will work feverishly to grab control of that government, in order to do evil and avoid retribution. In a society of pure evil, then, the only hope for stability would be a state of nature, where a general arming and fear of retribution would blunt the evil intents of disparate groups. As is the case between nuclear-armed nations, a “balance of power” breeds peace.

The third possibility is that *most* people are evil, and only a few are good. If that is the case, then the government also cannot be permitted to exist, since the majority of those in control of the government will be evil, and will rule despotically over the good minority. Democracy in particular cannot be permitted, since the minority of good people would be subjugated to the democratic control of the evil majority. Evil people, who wish to do harm without fear of retribution, would inevitably control the government, and use its power to do evil free of the fear of consequences.

Good people do not act morally because they fear retribution, but because they love virtue and peace of mind – and thus, unlike evil people, they have little to gain by controlling the government. In this scenario, then, the government will inevitably be controlled by a majority of evil people who will rule over all, to the detriment of all moral people.

The fourth option is that most people are good, and only a few are evil. This possibility is subject to the same problems outlined above, notably that evil people will always want to gain control over the government, in order to shield themselves from just retaliation for their crimes. This option only changes the *appearance* of democracy: because the majority of people are good, evil power-seekers must lie to them in order to gain power, and then, after achieving public office, will immediately break faith and pursue their own corrupt agendas, enforcing their wills through the police and the military.[^7] Thus the government remains the greatest prize to the most evil men, who will quickly gain control over its awesome power – to the detriment of all good souls – and so the government cannot be permitted to exist in this scenario either.

It is clear, then, that there is no situation under which a government can logically or morally be allowed to exist. The only possible justification for the existence of a government would be if the majority of men are evil, but all the power of the government is always controlled by a minority of good men.[^8]

This situation, while interesting theoretically, breaks down logically because:

1. The evil majority would quickly outvote the minority or overpower them through a coup;
2. There is no way to ensure that only good people would always run the government; and,
3. There is absolutely no example of this having ever occurred in any of the brutal annals of state history.

The logical error always made in the defence of the government is to imagine that any collective moral judgements being applied to any group of people is *not also being applied to the group which rules over them*. If fifty percent of people are evil, then *at least* fifty percent of people ruling over them are also evil.[^9] Thus the existence of evil can never justify the existence of a government.

If there is no evil, governments are unnecessary. If evil exists, the governments are far too dangerous to be allowed to exist.

Why is this error so prevalent?

There are a number of reasons, which can only be touched on here. The first is that the government introduces itself to children in the form of public school teachers who are considered moral authorities. Thus are *morality* and *authority* first associated with the government – an association that is then reinforced through years of grinding repetition.

The second is that the government never teaches children about the root of its power – violence – but instead pretends that it is just another social institution, like a business or a church or a charity, but more moral.

The third is that the prevalence of religion and propaganda has always blinded men to the evils of the government – which is why rulers have always been so interested in furthering the interests of churches and state “education.” In the religious world-view, absolute power is synonymous with perfect virtue, in the form of a deity. In the real political world of men, however, increasing power always means increasing evil. With religion, also, all that happens must be for the good – thus, fighting encroaching political power is fighting the will of the deity. There are many more reasons, of course, but these are among the deepest.[^10]

At the beginning of this section, I mentioned that people generally make *two* errors when confronted with the idea of dissolving the government. The first is the belief that governments are necessary because evil people exist. The second is the belief that, in the absence of governments, any social institutions that arise will inevitably take the place of governments. Thus, Dispute Resolution Organisations (DROs), insurance companies and private security forces are all considered potential cancers that will swell and overwhelm the body politic.

This view arises from the same error outlined above. If *all* social institutions are constantly trying to grow in power and enforce their wills on others, then by that very argument a centralised government cannot be allowed to exist. If it is an iron law that groups always try to gain power over other groups and individuals, then that power-lust *will not end if one of them wins, but will continue to spread across society virtually unopposed until slavery is the norm*.

The only way that social institutions can grow into violent monopolies is *to offload the costs of enforcement onto their victims*. Governments grow endlessly because they can pay tax collectors with a portion of the taxes they collect. The slaves are thus forced to pay for the costs of their enslavement.

In a voluntary society, there would be no taxation, and thus any group wishing to gain monopolistic power would have to fund its army itself, which would never be economically feasible or profitable.[^11]

It is very hard to understand the logic and intelligence of the argument that, in order to protect us from a group that *might* overpower us, we should support a group that *already has* overpowered us. It is similar to the statist argument about private monopolies – that citizens should create a governmental monopoly because they are afraid of private monopolies. It does not take keen vision to see through such nonsense.

What is the evidence for the view that decentralised and competing powers promotes peace? In other words, are there any facts that we can draw on to support the idea that a balance of power is the only chance that the individual has for freedom?

Organised crime does not provide many good examples, since gangs so regularly corrupt, manipulate and use the power of the government police to enforce their rule, and so such gangs cannot be said to be operating in a state of nature. Also, criminal gangs profit enormously by supplying legally-banned substances or services, and so also flourish largely due to state policies.

A more useful example is the fact that no leader has ever declared war on another leader who possesses nuclear weapons. In the past, when leaders felt themselves immune from personal retaliation, they were more than willing to kill off their own populations by waging war. Now that they are themselves subject to annihilation, they are only willing to attack countries that cannot fight back.

This is an instructive lesson on why such men require disarmed and dependent populations – and a good example of how the fear of reprisal inherent in a balanced system of decentralised and competing powers *is the only proven method of securing and maintaining personal liberty*.

Fleeing from imaginary devils into the protective prisons of governments only ensures the destruction of the very liberties that make life worth living.

### Governments And Religion

The idea that being born creates a contract with a fictional agency, which in practical terms makes you a quasi-slave to specific individuals, is common to both religion and the state – and one other, far more personal agency, which I talk about in my first book “On Truth: The Tyranny Of Illusion.”

Whenever a priest says: “Obey God,” what he is really saying is: “Obey *me*.” Since God does not exist, any commandment that the priest claims is coming from God, is actually coming from the priest. “God” is just the fictional entity used to bully you conceptually in order to obtain your very practical subservience in the real world, to real individuals, in terms of voluntarily handing over money, time and resources.

It is far more efficient for exploiters to have their slaves consider slavery a virtue, since it cuts down enormously on the costs of controlling them. If I can convince you that it is evil to avoid serving me, and virtuous to be my slave, then I do not need to hire nearly as many thugs to bully, control and steal from you.

Religious and state mythologies, then, are fictions that vastly reduce the costs of controlling populations; they are the lubricant and fuel for the ghastly machinery of institutionalised violence.

Throughout the world, rulers are a very small percentage of the population. How can it be possible for one to two percent of people to control everybody else? There is a certain monopoly on armaments, to be sure, but that monopoly is relatively easy to counter, since most governments make a fortune selling weapons throughout the world.

The sad reality is that people as a whole are enslaved to fictional entities such as nations, gods, cultures – and governments.

Our personal pride would instinctively rebel against a immediate and enforced slavery to another human being – however, we seem to almost revel in slavery to *mythology*.

Our desire to be good – combined with the thrill of virtue that we get by obeying moral mythologies – has us lining up to willingly hand our resources over to those who claim to represent these mythologies.

One central reason that we know that governments and gods are unnecessary is that they are so effective. *We know that most people desperately want to be good because they are so easily controlled by moral theories*.

The logic of obedience to mythology is patently foolish. If a priest tells me that I have to obey “God,” this is exactly the same as him telling me that I must obey an entity called “Nog.” Even if I accept that this fictional entity is worthy of eternal obedience, this still in no way would compel me to obey *the priest*. If I tell you to “obey your heart,” can I then reasonably say: “and *I alone* speak for your heart”?

Of course not.

When we strip away mythology and fiction from our “interactions” with our rulers, what emerges is a grim, stark and murderously exploitive reality.

Let’s take as an example a very real and present danger: taxation.

#### Taxation

I am told that, by virtue of choosing to live in Canada, I owe “the government” more than fifty percent of my income.

Stripped of mythology, what does this really translate to?

In reality, I will wait until the end of time for “the government” to come and pick up its money. Waiting for “the government” to drop by is like wanting to date the concept “femininity.” I may as well try to pay for my dinner with the word “money.”

In reality, when I am told that I must pay my taxes to “the government,” what this actually means is that I must write a check to transfer my money into a particular bank account, which is then accessed by particular individuals. These individuals then have the right to take that money, and spend it as they see fit – these particular individuals thus have complete control over my money.

At no point whatsoever does any such entity as “the government” lift a finger, make a move, open a bank account, or spend a penny. Imagining that a concept called “the government” has the capacity to take or spend your money is exactly the same as waiting for “God” to come and pick you up and take you to church.

Thus the real interaction is that one guy sends me a letter telling me that I owe him money. I have no contract with this guy, and he does not in fact own any of my property, although some other guys wrote a supposed “contract” which claims that he does.

If I do not pay this guy, he will send another guy over to my house to collect the money – plus “interest” and “charges.”

Normally, when a man with a gun comes to my house and demands my money, I have the right to use force to defend myself. In this case, however, because he is in a costume and claims to represent a fictional entity, I am not allowed to use force to defend myself.

Now, if I come to your house tonight dressed as a “high elf of Narnia” and demand the money that you owe to the “Queen of Sorrows,” assuming it is not Halloween, you are allowed to stare at me in amazement, and order me off your property.

If I do not pay the man who comes to take my money, he is allowed to pull out a gun, point it at my chest, and kidnap me – or shoot me if I resist. He can hold me in a tiny cell for year after year, where I will be subjected to the most violent brutality and continual rape, until he chooses to let me go.

Interestingly, if a man legitimately owes me money, I am not allowed to kidnap him and subject him to torture and rape for year after year. Thus taxation utterly violates the UPB framework, since it is the violent transfer of property using the initiation of force.

Stealing, as we have proven, is evil.

Einstein revolutionised physics by claiming – and proving – that the speed of light was constant.

We can revolutionise the world by accepting the claim – and the proof – that stealing is always evil.

### Government, Religion, And UPB

When we take the UPB framework and apply it to moral propositions regarding government and religion, some very interesting results occur.

The proposition that is most often used to justify government power is: “the government has the right to take your money.” This, however, is an utterly imprecise and false statement. The “government” does not have the right to take your money, since “the government” is merely a concept, an abstract description for a self-defined group of people. UPB requires a more consistent and objective statement. Since moral rules must be the same for everyone in all places and at all times, we must rephrase the rule in this way:

“*Human beings can morally take money from other human beings if they make up a conceptual agency that justifies their actions.*”

If we return to Bob and Doug in our little room of moral experimentation, we can very quickly see that this becomes an impossible proposition.

If Bob says to Doug: “I now represent the ideal concept ‘FUBAR,’ which fully justifies me taking your lighter from you. Since you now owe me your lighter, you must hand it over, or I will be compelled to take it from you by force.”

What will Doug’s reaction be? Remember, according to UPB, whatever is valid for Bob must also be valid for Doug. Inevitably, Doug will reply: “Oh yeah? Well *I* now represent the ideal concept ‘ANTI-FUBAR,’ which fully justifies me retaining possession of my lighter. Since you now have no right to take my lighter, if you try to take it, I will be compelled to defend myself by force.”

As you can see, if *Bob* has the right to make up imaginary obligations and impose them on Doug, then *Doug* has the right to make up imaginary obligations and impose them on Bob. Clearly, we immediately end up in a perfect stalemate. If it is morally good to impose made-up obligations on other people, but it is impossible to do it if *everyone* possesses that ability, then morality becomes impossible. The only way that Bob can impose his made-up obligation on Doug is if Doug refuses to impose his made up obligation on Bob – thus we have a situation where what is moral for one person can only be achieved by the other person acting in an anti-moral manner. Virtue can thus only be enabled by vice, which is impossible – and we have opposing moral rules for two human beings in the same circumstance, which UPB instantly rejects as invalid.

In other words, every imaginary abstract justification for the use of force can be countered by another imaginary abstract justification for the use of force. If I have an imaginary friend that can justify everything I do, then *you* also can have an imaginary friend that can justify everything you do. Thus neither of us can possess the ability to impose our imaginary obligations on others.

#### Religion And UPB

The same holds true for religion.

The statement: “You must obey me because God commands it,” must be restated more accurately as: “an entity that I have made up commands you to obey me.” The principle that UPB requires, then, is: “Human beings must impose unchosen positive obligations on others, and justify those obligations according to imaginary entities.”

Here we see the same issues as above. Bob tells Doug: “You must give me your lighter, because my imaginary friend tells you to.” Naturally, Doug replies: “You must not ask me for your lighter, because *my* imaginary friend forbids you to.” If Bob’s “commandments” are valid, then Doug’s “commandments” are equally valid, and so cancel each other out.

In the same way, if a man claims that his concept called “the government” justifies his theft of my property, then I can claim that my concept called “the anti-government” justifies my *retention* of my property, and we are both equally “valid” in our justifications.

If this tax collector then claims that his concept called “the government” only justifies his theft of *my* property, not my retention of it, then we are no further ahead. He can take my thousand dollars, but then I can invoke my concept to “steal” that money back, and his moral theory commands us to spend the rest of eternity handing back and forth the thousand dollars.

#### UPB And "The Majority"

UPB does not allow for the accumulation of individuals to override or reverse the properties of each individual. Ten lions do not make an elephant, a government, or a god. Ten thousand soldiers might make an “army,” but they cannot reverse gravity, or make murder moral.

Returning one last time to the room of Bob and Doug, let’s introduce “Jane.”

Now that there are three people in the room, we can look at the “majority rule” principle.

If Bob, Doug and Jane take a “vote” on whether or not it is moral to rape Jane, we would all recoil at such an unjust and immoral premise. Clearly, even if Jane were “outvoted,” we would not consider the resulting rape to be transformed into a morally good act.

Why not?

Well, UPB does not recognise the reality of aggregations, since the “majority” is a mere conceptual tag; it does not exist in reality, any more than “gods” or “governments” do. Thus to claim that the concept of “the majority” has any sort of moral standing is utterly invalid – it is like saying that “the Fatherland” can impregnate a woman, or that one can sit in the word “chair.”

To say that “the majority” has rights or attributes which directly contradict the rights or attributes of any individual also contradicts rational principles, since any conceptual grouping is only validated by the accurate identification of individual characteristics. If I say that “mammals” are warm-blooded living creatures, can I logically include three plastic flamingos in the category “mammal”?

Of course not.

Thus if it is evil for human beings to rape, can I logically create a category called “the majority” and then claim that for *these* human beings, rape is now morally good?

Of *course* not.

### Majority Rule

Can I create a moral rule that says: “the majority should be able to do whatever it wants”?

Of course I can, but it will never be valid or true.

Only *individuals* act – the “majority” never does. If moral rules can change when a certain number of people get together, then UPB is continually violated.

If it is moral for Bob and Doug to rape Jane because they have “outvoted her,” what happens when Jane’s two friends show up and vote against Bob and Doug’s infernal desires?

Well, suddenly Bob and Doug are the ones outvoted, and rape becomes “evil” for them again.

Nothing substantial has changed in these “outvoting” scenarios, but we have a series of opposing moral rules for the same men – a violation of UPB, and thus invalid.

Rape cannot be good, then evil, then good again, just because a few hands are raised or lowered.

Thus if you think that “majority rule” sounds like a reasonable moral proposition, and a perfectly valid moral theory, then I am afraid you’re going to have to go back to the beginning of this book and start again!☺
