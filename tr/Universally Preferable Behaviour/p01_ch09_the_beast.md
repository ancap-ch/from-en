## Canavar

An objective review of human history would seem to point to the grim reality that by far the most dangerous thing in the world is *false ethical systems*.

If we look at an ethical system like communism, which was responsible for the murders of one hundred seventy million people, we can clearly see that the real danger to individuals was not random criminals, but *false moral theories*. Similarly, the Spanish Inquisition relied not on thieves and pickpockets, but rather priests and torturers filled with the desire to save the souls of others. Nazism also relied on particular ethical theories regarding the relationship between the individual and the collective, and the moral imperative to serve those in power, as well as theories “proving” the innate virtues of the Aryan race.

Over and over again, throughout human history, we see that the most dangerous instruments in the hands of men are not guns, or bombs, or knives, or poisons, but rather *moral theories*. From the “divine right of kings” to the endlessly legitimised mob rule of modern democracies, from the ancestor worship of certain Oriental cultures to the modern deference to the nation-state as personified by a political leader, to those who pledge their children to the service of particular religious ideologies, it is clear that by far the most dangerous tool that men possess is *morality*. Unlike science, which merely describes what is, and what is to be, moral theories exert a near-bottomless influence over the hearts and minds of men by telling them what *ought* to be.

When our leaders ask for our obedience, it is never to themselves as *individuals*, they claim, but rather to “the good” in the abstract. JFK did not say: “Ask not what I can do for you, but rather what you can do for me...” Instead, he substituted the words “your country” for himself. Service to “the country” is considered a virtue – although the net beneficiaries of that service are always those who rule citizens by force. In the past (and sometimes even into the present), leaders identified themselves with God, rather than with geography, but the principle remains the same. For Communists, the abstract mechanism that justifies the power of the leaders is *class*; for fascists it is the *nation*; for Nazis it is the *race*; for democrats it is “the will of the people”; for priests it is “the will of God” and so on.

Ruling classes inevitably use ethical theories to justify their power for the simple reason that human beings have an implacable desire to act in accordance to what they believe to be “the good.” If service to the Fatherland can be defined as “the good,” then such service will inevitably be provided. If obedience to military superiors can be defined as “virtue” and “courage,” then such violent slavery will be endlessly praised and performed.

### Propaganda

The more false the moral theory is, the earlier that it must be inflicted upon children. We do not see the children of scientifically minded people being sent to “logic school” from the tender age of three or four onwards. We do not see the children of free market advocates being sent to “Capitalism Camp” when they are five years old. We do not see the children of philosophers being sent to a Rational Empiricism Theme Park in order to be indoctrinated into the value of trusting their own senses and using their own minds.

No, wherever ethical theories are corrupt, self-contradictory and destructive, they must be inflicted upon the helpless minds of dependent children. The Jesuits are credited with the proverb: “Give me a child until he is nine and he will be mine for life,” but that is only because the Jesuits were teaching superstitious and destructive lies. You could never imagine a modern scientist hungering to imprint his falsehoods on a newborn consciousness. Picture somebody like Richard Dawkins saying the above, just to see how ridiculous it would be.

Any ethicist, then, who focuses on mere criminality, rather than the institutional crimes supported by ethical theories, is missing the picture almost entirely, and serving mankind up to the slaughterhouse. A doctor who, in the middle of a universal and deadly plague, focused his entire efforts on communicating about the possible health consequences of being slightly overweight, would be considered rather deranged, and scarcely a reliable guide in medical matters. If your house is on fire, mulling over the colours you might want to paint your walls might well be considered a sub-optimal prioritisation.

Private criminals exist, of course, *but have almost no impact on our lives comparable to those who rule us on the basis of false moral theories*. Once, when I was eleven, another boy stole a few dollars from me. Another time, when I was twenty-six, I left my ATM card in a bank machine, and someone stole a few hundred dollars from my account.

On the other hand, I have had hundreds of thousands of dollars taken from me by force through the moral theory of “taxation is good.” I was forced to sit in the grim and brain-destroying mental gulags of public schools for fourteen years, based on the moral theory that “state education is a virtue.”[^12]

Paramı çalan çocuk (ve adam) şüphesiz ki o parayı kişisel zevk ve ihtiyaçları için kullandı. Diğer yandan, paramı çalan hükümet, fakire zulmetmek, savaşa ödenek sağlamak, zengini doyurmak, para borç almak ve böylece çocuklarımı fakirleştirmek - ve benden çalan kişilerin maaşlarını ödemek için kullanıyor.

Eğer korkunç bir salgına maruz kalmış büyük bir şehirde bir doktor olsaydım, ve bu salgının su boruları ile iletildiği keşfetseydim, eğer gerçekten vatandaşlarımın sağlığını düşünüyor olsaydım- mantıklı yanıtım ne olurdu?

Eminim ki çatılara çıkıp salgının içme sularından kaynaklandığını avazım çıktığınca bağırırdım. Eminim ki insanların yakalandığı bu hastalığın gerçek kaynağını anlaması için bütün önlemleri alırdım.

Eminim ki, bu kadar evrensel ve önüne geçilebilir bir zehirlenmenin bilgisiyle, zamanımı yüzleştiğiniz gerçek tehlikenin rastgele bir bireyin gelecekte sizi zehirlemeye karar verebileceğiyle ilgili küçük bir ihtimali tartışmakla harcamazdım.

Nitekim, şiddet ve ahlaksızlık ile ilgilenen bir filozof olarak, kişisel suçlulara mı odaklanmalıyım, yoksa umumi olanlarla mı?

The violations that I experienced at the hands of private criminals fade to insignificance relative to even *one day* under the tender mercies of my “virtuous and good masters.”

If, then, the greatest dangers to mankind are false ethical theories, then our highest prioritisation should be the discovery, communication and refinement of a valid, rational, empirical and consistent ethical theory. If we discover that most plague victims are dying from impure water, then surely telling them to purify their water should be our first and highest priority.

Let us now turn to that task.
