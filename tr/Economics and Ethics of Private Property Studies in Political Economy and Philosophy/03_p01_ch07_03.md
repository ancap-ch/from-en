### Dolandırıcılık sorunu II: Kısmi Rezerv Bankacılığı ve Sözleşme Özgürlüğü

Murray Rothbard'ın kısmi rezerv bankacılığını dolandırıcılık olarak sınıflandırması, özellikle etik ve mülkiyet-hakları teorisinin uzun ve yoğun bir çalışmasının sonucuydu. Selgin ve White, doğrudan, ekonomiyi entelektüel olarak bağımsız ve etikten ayrı görüyorlar. Bu, mülkiyet ve mülkiyet hakları teorisi hakkında ön bilgi sahibi olmaksızın incelenebilir. Onlar yine de kapsamlı etik yönergeler yapmaktan çekinmiyorlar. Kısmi rezerv bankacılığının manevi savunmasında Selgin ve White, bir mülkiyet teorisi özetlemeyi bırak, nadiren mülkiyete değiniyorlar. Bu, bir dizi temel hata ve sorunla sonuçlanıyor: mülkiyet ve mülkiyet başlıkları arasındaki ayrım konusundaki karışıklık; bir eşyanın(mülkiyet) eş zamanlı olarak birden fazla kişi tarafından sahiplenilmesinin imkanı ya da imkansızlığı konusundaki karışıklık; sözleşme ve sözleşme teorisine karşı mülkiyet ve mülkiyet teorisinin mantıksal önceliği konusundaki karışıklık; ve kişinin mülküyle (Herhangi bir kimsenin değil) beraber sözleşme yükümlülüklerini yerine getirme gerekliliği konusundaki karışıklık.

Bu zorluklar, yazarların "sözleşme özgürlüğü" konusundaki tartışmalarına girmektedir. Yazarların argümanları anlaşılır.

> Eğer bir banka belirtmiyorsa ya da kendisini açıkça %100 rezerv tutmaya zorluyorsa, önemsiz rezervler banka ve müşteri arasındaki sözleşmeyi ihlal etmez…. Kısmi rezerv tutma iznini veren gönüllü sözleşme düzenlemelerini yasaklamak bu nedenle piyasaya bir müdahaledir, özel mülkiyet haklarının vazgeçilmez bir parçası olan sözleşme özgürlüğünde bir kısıtlamadır.[^14]

Bu pasaj Selgin'in ve White'ın çoktan belirttiği aşırı-öznelciliği tekrardan gün yüzüne çıkarıyor. Bu görüşe göre, geçerli bir sözleşme yapan—teşkil eden ve tanımlayan—gönüllü anlaşmalardır. Buna rağmen, geçerli sözleşmeler gayrimenkul transferine ilişkin anlaşmalardır; bundan dolayı, geçerli sözleşmelerin yelpazesi aslında mülkiyetin doğası tarafından temel olarak kısıtlanmıştır(ve ancak o zaman anlaşma tarafından). Bu yüzden Hoppe (p. 70) açıkladı

> Sözleşme özgürlüğü, karşılıklı avantajı olan *her* sözleşmeye izin verilmesi gerektiğini vurgulamaz…. Sözleşme özgürlüğü, A ve B'nin *kendi mülkleriyle ilişkili* herhangi bir sözleşme yapmasına izin verilmesi anlamına gelir, ancak kısmi rezerv bankacılığı üçüncü tarafların mülkleri ile ilgili sözleşme yapmayı kapsar.[^15]

Selgin ve White, bu yüklemeyi kısmen yanıltıcı bir şekilde "üçüncü-taraf etkileri" olarak nitelendiriyorlar ve mülkiyet ile mülkiyet haklarının niteliğine ilişkin olarak temel karışıklıkla birlikte sırayla Hoppe'u suçlayarak karşı koyuyorlar. Öncelikle şunu belirtiyorlar

> başkalarının eylemlerinden, C'nin mallarının *değerine* dağılma … kaçınılmaz serbest pazar olgusudur ve C'nin mal haklarının ihlali anlamına gelmez, [whereas] C'nin mallarının *fiziksel istilaları* … elbette ki C'nin mülkiyet haklarının korunmasıyla tutarsızdır. Açıktır ki, eğer A ve B, C veya C'nin haklı mallarına karşı herhangi bir fiziksel saldırganlık veya tehdit olmaksızın, sadece C mallarının *piyasa değerini* etkileyen herhangi bir işlemden men edilirlerse, özel mülkiyet, sözleşme özgürlüğü ve serbest piyasa rekabetinin ilkeleri tamamen ortadan kalkar. B'nin Cd kayıtlarını A'ya satmayı teklif etmesi yasaklanacak mı, sadece C'nin vinil kayıt envanterinin pazar değerini düşürdüğü için mi?[^16]

Second, they state that the reduction of the purchasing power of money, which they admit must result from every issue of fiduciary media, is as such a harmless value-effect and thus “provides no justification for legally barring the bank’s action.” Hence they conclude that Hoppe’s argument is “invalid” (and incompatible with Rothbard’s theory of property).

Selgin ve White'ın karşı argümanı iki hatayı içeriyor. Birincisi, büyük önerme doğruyken, Hoppe'un önerme hakkında hatalı olduğunu söylemek yanlıştır. Hoppe, mülkiyet hakları teorisini kapsamlı bir şekilde yazmıştır ve sadece Selgin ve White'ın bahsettiği ayrımdan haberdar değil, aynı zamanda praxeolojik bir savunma sağlamaktadır; Dolayısıyla bu bakımdan Rothbard ile Hoppe arasında hiçbir yargı farkı yoktur.[^17]

İkincisi, küçük önerme, açıkça yanlıştır(ve dolayısıyla sonuç da budur). Selgin ve White, mütevelli medyanın yayınlanmasından kaynaklanan paranın satın alma gücündeki düşüşün başka herhangi bir şeyin(arz ve / veya talep değişiklikleri sebebiyle) fiyatındaki düşüş gibi zararsız bir olayla aynı türden olduğunu iddia ediyor. That money owners lose purchasing power as a result of fractional reserve banking, they claim, is not different from the situation in which the owners of potatoes or cars suffer a value-loss due to a larger supply of or a reduced demand for potatoes and cars.

Here again, Selgin and White conflate money (gold)—that is, property—and money substitutes (banknotes)—that is, property titles. To be sure, the issue of fiduciary media does not lead to physical damage to real property. After all, a banknote is just a piece of paper, and paper does not exert any relevant physical effect on the external world. But the same can be said also about the issue of fiduciary titles to potatoes or cars (titles backed by assets other than potatoes or cars). They, too, are merely pieces of paper, and as such have no impact on the real world. Yet there exists an important difference between changes in a potato or car owner’s wealth position due to changes in the supply or demand for potatoes or cars on the one hand, and changes brought about by changes in the supply or demand for titles to nonexisting (unchanged) quantities of potatoes or cars on the other hand. Surely, the owners of potatoes or cars are affected differently in both cases. In the first case, if the price of potatoes or cars falls due to a larger potato or car supply, all current potato or car owners remain (unchangingly) in possession of the same quantity of property (potatoes or cars). No one’s physical property is diminished. Likewise, if the price falls because potato or car buyers are willing to offer only lesser quantities of other goods in exchange for potatoes or cars, this by itself has no effect on any current potato or car owner’s physical quantity of potatoes or cars. In distinct contrast in the second case, the issue and sale of an additional title to an unchanged quantity of potatoes or cars *does* lead to a quantitative diminution of some current potato or car owner’s physical property. It does not merely have a value-effect: the purchasing power of potato or car titles will fall. It does have a physical effect: the issuer and seller of fiduciary potato or car titles misappropriates other people’s potatoes or cars. He appropriates other people’s property without relinquishing any property of his own (in exchange for an empty property title).[^18]

### The Issue of Fraud III: The "Proof from Existence" Fractional Reserve Banking and State

Neither the title-transfer theory of contract nor the principle of freedom of contract supports the claim that the issue of fiduciary media and fractional reserve banking is ethically justified. To the contrary, only one other argument remains in support of the claim that fractional reserve banking represents a legitimate form of business.

The argument boils down to a proof from existence: X, Y, or Z exists; it would not exist if it were not beneficial; hence, it should exist (and outlawing it would be detrimental and morally wrong).

Thus, write Selgin and White:

> the group [of people] whose freedom of contract we are concerned with here is not a small eccentric bunch, but is the great mass of people who have demonstrated that they do prefer banks that operate on fractional reserves…. Depositors continue to patronize these banks, demonstrating their preference, for them.[^19]
> 
> … By the principle of demonstrated preference depositors must be presumed to benefit from the package they have agreed to accept, risk and all.[^20]
> 
> \[Consequently,\] \[if\] *any* person knowingly prefers to put money into an (interest-bearing) fractional-reserve account, rather than into a (storage-fee-charging) 100 percent reserve account, then a blanket prohibition on fractional-reserve banking by force of law is a binding legal restriction on freedom of contact in the market for banking services.[^21]
> 
> [Moreover,] … [b]enefits accrue to bank depositors and noteholders, who receive interest and services paid for by the extra bank revenue generated from lending out a portion of its liabilities. Benefits accrue to bank borrowers who enjoy a more ample supply of intermediated credit, and to everyone who works with the economy’s consequently larger stock of capital equipment. And benefits must accrue to bank shareholders, who could choose to have the bank not issue demand liabilities if they found the risks not worth bearing.[^22]

Selgin and White have here put the cart before the horse. The existence of a practice, however widespread, has no bearing on the question of whether it is justifiable or not. Consider first, for illustrative purposes, the following analogy concerning the ethical permissibility of a state, that is, of a territorial monopolist of law and order (or of justice and protection).[^23]

In the words of Selgin and White (applied here in a different context and paraphrased), the group of people whose freedom of contract we are concerned with is not a small eccentric bunch, but is the great mass of people who have demonstrated that they do prefer states (judges and protectors) that operate on a monopolistic basis. Territorial inhabitants continue to patronize these states, demonstrating their preference for them. By the principle of demonstrated preference, territorial inhabitants must be presumed to benefit from the package they have agreed to accept, risk and all. Consequently, if any person knowingly prefers to put money into a tax-bearing state account, rather than into a protection-fee-charging account in nontaxing justice and protection agencies, then a blanket prohibition on state-formation by force of law is a binding legal restriction on freedom of contract in the market for justice and protection services. Moreover, benefits accrue to state depositors and noteholders, who receive interest and services paid for by the extra state revenue generated from employing parts of the deposits for extra tax collections. Benefits accrue to state borrowers who enjoy a more ample supply of intermediated credit, and to everyone who works with the economy’s consequently larger stock of capital equipment. And benefits must accrue to state shareholders, who could choose to have the state not engage in taxation if they found the risks not worth taking.

Given their own libertarian credentials, Selgin and White would presumably reject this analogy as false and inappropriate. But if so, why? What is it that invalidates the second *proof*, but not the first? What if anything, makes a blanket prohibition (or permission) of fractional reserve banking categorically different from a blanket prohibition (or permission) of state formation and operation?

The answer—that no such difference exists and that both proofs are equally invalid—is to be found in the Rothbardian principle of demonstrated preference. While Selgin and White invoke this principle in support of their conclusion regarding the ethical permissibility of fractional reserve banking, they miss its implication. The principle of demonstrated preference, as explained by Rothbard in his celebrated “Toward a Reconstruction of Utility and Welfare Economics,” *presupposes* property rights. Not all demonstrated preferences are ethically permissible or socially beneficial. Instead, the only such preferences that are permissible and welfare enhancing are these that are expressed by means of one’s own property and nothing but one’s own property. Every preference demonstration by means of property other than one’s own—with other people’s property—is impermissible and nonbeneficial.

As for the demonstrated preference for states, it runs afoul of Rothbard’s principle. In Rothbard’s analysis, which is presumably accepted by the participants on both sides of the current debate, the violation can be quickly pinpointed. Private property, as the result of acts of (original) appropriation and/or production, implies the owner’s right to exclusive jurisdiction regarding his property, including the right to employ this property in defense against possible invasions and invaders. Indeed, there can be no property without an owner’s right to physical defense, and it is the very purpose of private property to establish separate domains of exclusive jurisdiction. No private-property owner can possibly surrender his right to ultimate jurisdiction over and defense of his property to someone else—unless he sells or otherwise transfers his property (in which case someone else would have exclusive jurisdiction over it). That is, so long as something (a good) has not been abandoned, its owner must be presumed as retaining these rights; and as far as his relations to others are concerned, every property owner may then only partake in the advantages of the division of labor and seek better and improved protection of his unalterable property rights through cooperation with other owners of property. Every property owner can buy from, sell to, or otherwise contract with everyone else concerning supplemental property protection and security services. Yet each owner also may at any time unilaterally discontinue any such cooperation with others. In distinct contrast, a territorial monopoly of protection and jurisdiction—a state—implies that every property owner is prohibited from discontinuing his cooperation with his protector, and that no one (except the monopolist) may exercise ultimate jurisdiction over his own property. Rather, everyone except the monopolist has lost his right to defense and is thus rendered defenseless vis-à-vis his own protector. Obviously, such an institution stands in contradiction to every owner’s demonstrated preference of not giving up his property. Contrary to their demonstrated preference, the monopolist prohibits the people from using their property in physical defense against possible invasions by himself and his agents. A monopoly of protection and jurisdiction rests thus from the outset on an impermissible act of expropriation (taxation) and provides the monopolist and his agents with a license to further expropriation and taxation. Every owner’s range of permissible actions regarding his own property, and hence the value of his property, is diminished, whereas the monopolist’s range of action and control is correspondingly enlarged and his exclusive privilege is reflected in an increase in the value of his property (capitalization of monopoly profit).

Presently, states exist everywhere, and almost everyone resides under state *protection*. Regardless of this preference demonstration, however, there is nothing wrong, ethically or economically, with blanket protection against state formation. No one may form a state, for the same reason that no one may expropriate or rob anyone else. In a court of law, it would be sufficient that a single property owner objected to the monopoly’s existence, and the monopolist would have to cease in his current operation as a tax-yielding protection agency and be repaired to the legal status of a nontaxing but fee-charging law-and-security agency (a normal specialized firm). A tax-yielding protection agency is a contradiction in terms—an invasive protector—and must be forbidden, irrespective of any benefits accruing to state depositors, state borrowers, and state owners. To do so is not a legal restriction on freedom of contract in the market for justice and protection services, but the very presupposition of freedom of contract and justice. Everyone putting money or any other resources into a tax-yielding protection account is engaged in unlawful action and subject to punishment.

Just as states exist everywhere, so do fractional reserve banks, and nowadays practically everyone is banking with fractional reserve banks. What, if anything, is the difference between the status of a state and that of a fractional reserve bank? Why should fractional reserve banks not be outlaw banks just as states outlaw protection agencies? To be sure, just as there can be no doubt concerning a demand for protection services, there can also be no doubt as to a demand for banking services. Yet the demand for protection services that private property owners may properly demonstrate does not include a demand for tax-yielding protection services, as we have seen. It exclusively permits a demand for fee-charging protection agencies. Why should an analogous distinction not be true also for banking services? Why should a demand for interest-yielding demand deposit accounts not be just as impermissible as the demand for tax-yielding protection accounts, on the ground that both interest-yielding deposit accounts and tax-yielding property protection are contradictions in terms? Why should the functions of a money warehouser and clearing institution (100-percent-reserve-deposit banking) and as an intermediary of credit (savings-and-loan banking) not be the only just forms of banking (just as fee-charging protection agencies are the only legitimate form of protection)?

[^23]: To avoid any misunderstanding, the term monopoly is employed here in its Rothbardian definition as an exclusive privilege (or the absence of free entry). A monopoly of law and order means that one may turn for justice and protection only to one party—the state—and that it is exclusively this party that determines the content of justice and protection.
