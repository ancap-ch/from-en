## Der dritte Test: Diebstahl

Wir werden ein wenig mehr Zeit mit Diebstahl verbringen müssen, da dies unweigerlich die Frage der Eigentumsrechte ins Spiel bringt, was für einige sehr umstritten ist.

Es gibt viele Möglichkeiten, sich mit der Frage der Eigentumsrechte zu befassen, vom "Homesteading" über rechtliche Definitionen bis zu praktischen Erwägungen usw. Ich werde hier keine ansprechen, denn die Frage der Eigentumsrechte muss in den Rahmen von UPB fallen, wenn UPB als eine rationale Methode zur Bewertung moralischer Vorschläge stehen soll.

Der moralische Vorschlag in Bezug auf Eigentumsrechte ist eindeutig Entweder haben Menschen das Recht, Eigentum zu besitzen oder nicht.

Jetzt ist die erste "Eigenschaft", mit der umgegangen werden muss, der Körper. "Eigentümer" muss in erster Linie aus Kontrolle über den eigenen Körper bestehen, denn wenn diese Kontrolle nicht existiert oder nicht als gültig angesehen wird, dann ist die ganze Frage der Moral - geschweige denn Eigentum- geht aus dem Fenster.

UPB ist ein Rahmenwerk zur Bewertung von moralischen Aussagen oder von Argumenten über allgemein bevorzugtes Verhalten für die gesamte Menschheit. In erster Linie muss ein Mensch für seine eigenen Handlungen verantwortlich sein, wenn er moralisch beurteilt werden soll, denn wie wir oben argumentiert haben, ist die Fähigkeit, Handlungen zu wählen, für jede ethische Bewertung grundlegend.

Wenn ein Mann keine Kontrolle über seinen Körper hat, dann hat er eindeutig keine Verantwortung für seine Handlungen - sie sind nicht "seine" Handlungen sondern die Handlungen seines Körpers. Nun würde niemand vernünftig argumentieren, dass, wenn ein Mann einen anderen Mann erwürgt, es die mörderischen Finger sind, die vor Gericht gestellt und bestraft werden sollten. Natürlich kann sich der Körper nicht vollständig selbst kontrollieren, sondern muss zu einem gewissen Grad unter der Leitung des Bewusstseins stehen.

Das bedeutet, dass ein Mann für die Handlungen seines Körpers verantwortlich ist und daher für die *Auswirkungen* dieser Handlungen verantwortlich ist. Ein Mann ist dafür verantwortlich, wo er seinen Penis ablegt, und so wissen wir, dass wir ihn wegen Vergewaltigung beurteilen können. Er "besitzt" die Handlungen seines Körpers so sicher wie er seinen Körper besitzt. Zu sagen, dass ein Mann für seinen Körper verantwortlich ist, aber nicht für die Auswirkungen seines Körpers, ist zu argumentieren, dass ein Mann dafür verantwortlich ist, ein Messer zu zielen und zu werfen, aber nicht dafür, wo es landet.

Auch argumentiert man, dass ein Mann nicht für die Auswirkungen seines Körpers verantwortlich ist, eine selbstzündende Aussage, ähnlich der, die wir oben untersucht haben. Wenn ich zu dir sage: "Männer sind nicht verantwortlich für die Handlungen ihrer Körper", wäre es sehr fair für dich, mich zu fragen, wer meine Stimmbänder und den Mund bearbeitet. Wenn ich sage, dass ich keine Kontrolle über meine Rede habe - was eine Auswirkung des Körpers ist - dann habe ich meine These "aufgehalten", auf Kosten einer völligen Ungültigkeitserklärung.

Wenn ich überhaupt nicht für meine Rede verantwortlich bin, dann hat es keinen Sinn, mit mir zu streiten. Ein Tonbandgerät ist auch nicht für seine Sprache verantwortlich, weshalb wir nicht in virulente Meinungsverschiedenheiten mit Magnetstreifen geraten. In kitschigen Horrorfilmen scheinen junge Mädchen besonders anfällig für dämonische Besessenheit zu sein - der unvermeidliche Priester, der auftaucht, bietet immer an, mit dem für das Mädchen verantwortlichen Dämon zu sprechen, woraufhin das Mädchen ein Geräusch wie Don Ho mit dem Gurgeln beginnt Lager.

Dieses lächerliche Porträt ist jedoch in einem gewissen Sinne richtig - wenn ein anderes Wesen die Stimmbänder des Mädchens vollständig kontrolliert, ist es dieses Wesen, das angesprochen werden muss, nicht das Mädchen, das keine Kontrolle über ihre Antworten hat.

Wenn ich also zu dir sage, dass ich meine Rede nicht kontrollieren kann, kannst du mich fragen: Wer macht das? Wenn ich antworte, dass niemand es tut, dann macht es ungefähr so viel Sinn, mit mir zu streiten, als mit einem Fernseher oder dem oben erwähnten Felsbrocken zu streiten, wenn er auf einem Hügel in Richtung Ihres Autos springt.

So erfordert die bloße Handlung, meinen Körper zu kontrollieren, um Sprache zu produzieren, die Akzeptanz meiner Fähigkeit, meine Rede zu kontrollieren - eine implizite Bestätigung meines Besitzes über meinen eigenen Körper.

Nun, wenn dämonische Besessenheit ein gültiges Ereignis wäre, und ein *Mädchen*, das von einem Dämon besessen ist, der auf einen Priester spuckt, würden wir das Mädchen nicht unhöflich nennen, aber wir würden sie eher bemitleiden, weil sie von solch einem unhöflichen Dämon bewohnt wurde. Wer den Körper des Mädchens kontrolliert, ist schuld an den Auswirkungen ihrer Handlungen - deshalb würden wir keinen Mann nennen, der während des Schlafwandelns "böse" gestohlen hat, da er nicht die volle Kontrolle über seinen eigenen Körper hatte (obwohl wir ihn auf andere Weise zurückhalten können). Dies ist auch der Grund für die Rechtliche Verteidigung von "Nicht schuldig durch den Wahnsinns", was bedeutet, dass wir einen guten Mann haben, der die Kontrolle über seine Hand hat.

Thus to reject the ownership of the body is to reject all morality, which, as we have seen above, is utterly impossible. Logically, since morality is defined as an enforceable subset of UPB, to reject morality is to say that it is universally preferable to believe that there is no such thing as universal preferences.

Finally, to use one’s ownership of one’s own body in the form of speech to reject the notion that one can control one’s own body, is a blatant and insurmountable self-contradiction.

It is in this way that any rejection of self-ownership can be utterly discarded.

Since we own our bodies, we also inevitably own the *effects* of our actions, be they good or bad. If we own the effects of our actions, then clearly we own that which we produce, whether what we produce is a bow, or a book – or a murder.

### Property And UPB

Even if we reject the above, we can still use UPB to definitively assert the existence of universal property rights.

As mentioned above, either human beings have property rights, or they do not. Except for a few grey areas, which we will get to shortly, this remains a universal proposition.

If a man does not have the right to use property, then he does not have the right to use his own body. He does not have the right to use his own lungs, and therefore must stop breathing. Although this sounds silly, it is an immediate and inevitable result of the premise that human beings do not have property rights.

It is fairly safe to assume that anyone you are debating property rights with is drawing breath, and thus agrees with you that he has the right to use his own body at least.

The question then comes up whether or not human beings have the right to *exclusive* property use. For instance, property could be defined as a sort of time-share principle of ownership, insofar as everyone should have the right to own everything, on some schedule or another.

This means of course that a man with lung cancer has a right to at least one lung of a healthy person. Since all ownership starts with the body, if we do not have the right to exclusive ownership over our own body, then we must share our body with other people, or be immoral. The sick man has a right to one of our lungs, and if we withhold it from him, that is exactly the same as stealing it. Similarly, both you and I have the right to use Celine Dion’s singing voice, since it is wholly selfish of her to pretend that she has exclusive ownership of it.

If human beings do not possess exclusive ownership over their own bodies, then the crime of rape becomes meaningless, since a woman clearly does not exclusively own her vagina, and neither does a man own his own various orifices. If exclusive self-ownership is not an axiom, then even the crime of murder becomes meaningless.

It is no crime to commit suicide, any more than it is to set fire to your own house, since the destruction of one’s own property is a valid exercise of ownership. However, if exclusive self-ownership is invalid, then there can be no distinction between murder and suicide. If my liver is failing, and I have a right to take yours, then I can “repossess” it in perfect accordance with morality and honourable behaviour. If this procedure kills you, so what? Without exclusive self-ownership, there is no “you” to begin with…

Thus we can reasonably say that exclusive self-ownership is a basic reality – that all human beings at all times and in all places have exclusive ownership over their own bodies, and thus have exclusive ownership over the effects of their own bodies, both in terms of moral behaviour and property creation or acquisition.

### The Grey Areas

Naturally, any statement such as the above brings the inevitable howls of “complexity,” which I fully agree with.

Let us say that I mean to give you five dollars as a gift, but by mistake I hand you a ten dollar bill, saying, “This is for you.” Few people would consider it theft if I said, the moment after I handed it to you: “Sorry, I meant to give you five dollars, not ten,” and took the larger note back, even though I am taking back property that I have voluntarily relinquished.

On the other extreme, if you are one of my sons, and I pay for your university education, and explicitly tell you that you never need to pay me back, my generosity will doubtless affect your spending habits. It would scarcely seem reasonable for me to clap my forehead after your graduation ceremony and cry, “Oh, I thought you were one of my *other* sons!” and demand repayment.

Similarly, it is generally accepted that children cannot enter into legal contracts, but that adults can. In many societies, the differentiating age is eighteen years. This means, of course, that at the stroke of midnight between a man’s seventeenth year and eighteenth birthday, his capacity to enter into legal contracts arrives fully formed. Has he gone through some massive biological transformation in that split second? Certainly not, although at eighteen he is biologically very different than he was at the age of ten, both in terms of physical and mental development.

For the sake of efficiency, if not perfect morality, arbitrary transitions are often placed between one state and another. Childhood is definitely one state; adulthood is quite another. The transition between childhood and adulthood is blended; it is not black and white, but rather like the day descending into dusk, and then night. Noon is definitely not night, and midnight is definitely not daytime, but there are times in between when it is harder to tell, although the direction of the transition is always clear.

In the same way, a man who is greatly mentally deficient can be considered far less responsible for his own actions. A man with an IQ of sixty-five is mentally scarcely more than a little child – a man with an IQ of one hundred is an average adult. If we say that a man with an IQ of eighty becomes responsible, then we are by definition saying that a man with an IQ of seventy-nine is not responsible – is that a clear, fair, and utterly objective demarcation? Certainly not, but in order for most concepts to be practical, the criterion of “good enough” and a reasonable cost/benefit analysis must be put into place. As mentioned above, no water is perfectly pure, but waiting for perfect purity would simply cause a man to die of thirst.

Given that the question of moral responsibility and intellectual capacity only applies to a very small percentage of people right on the border, and that creating objective and perfect tests is very likely to prove impossible, there will inevitably be some “rules of thumb” that win the day. We can only assume that, since biologists live with this kind of occasional subjectivism every day, moral philosophers can somehow survive as well.

### Property As Universality

UPB thus gives us clear options with regards to property rights. It cannot be the case that some men have property rights, while other men do not. It cannot be the case that men in Washington have property rights, while women in Baltimore do not. It cannot be the case that men have property rights today, but not tomorrow, and so on.

It also cannot be the case that men have only fifty percent property rights.

If I argue: “Men only have fifty percent property rights,” then I create yet another insurmountable contradiction. You may well ask me which half of my sentence was *not* generated by me. If I only have fifty percent property rights, then clearly I only have fifty percent control over my own body – if I put forward the above sentence, then clearly I am only in control of fifty percent of that sentence, since I only have fifty percent control over my voice. Who, then, is responsible for the other fifty percent of my sentence?

This may sound esoteric, but it is a deadly serious question, for reasons that we will get to shortly.

Let us say that we can somehow magically bypass the “fifty percent ownership of the body” problem, and say that human beings only have fifty percent property rights when it comes to *external* objects.

How does that work in practice?

Well, if I have two lawnmowers and you have none, then clearly it would be logical for you to have the right to take one of my lawnmowers, since I can only ever own half of my lawnmower collection.

However, when you take possession of one of my lawnmowers, unfortunately you are only ever allowed to own *half* of that lawnmower, since we only have the right to fifty percent ownership over external objects. Thus you must immediately find somebody with whom you can share the lawnmower. This brings your “just” ownership down to twenty-five percent. However, your new co-owner cannot have the right to twenty-five percent of the lawnmower, because he only has fifty percent rights for whatever ownership he possesses – thus he must find somebody to take fifty percent of the twenty-five percent that he has – and so on and so on and so on.

The problem with any theory that argues for less than one hundred percent property rights is that it instantly creates a “domino effect” of infinite regression, wherein everybody ends up with infinitely small ownership rights over pretty much everything, which is clearly impossible. Thus it must be the case – both logically and practically – that we have full ownership over our own bodies, and over the effects of our bodies, in terms of external property. We do not need a homesteading theory, or other “just acquisition” approaches to justify property rights – they are justified because anybody who acts in any way, shape or form – including arguing – is axiomatically exercising one hundred percent control over his own body, and “homesteading” both oxygen and sound waves in order to make his case.

Thus, by combining this axiomatic reality with UPB, we can easily understand that since anyone debating property rights is exercising one hundred percent control over his own property, the only question is whether or not property rights vary from individual to individual – a question definitively settled by the axiomatic fact of self-ownership, as well as the UPB framework. Any moral proposition must be universal and consistent, and this is how we also know that *everyone* has one hundred percent property rights.

Any other possibility is logically and empirically impossible.

### Testing "Theft"

Let us return to our patient moral guinea pigs, Bob and Doug.

If theft is morally good, then once again we face the problem of the impossibility of simultaneous morality. If Bob has a lighter, and it is morally good to steal, then Doug must steal Bob’s lighter. However, the moment that Doug is stealing Bob’s lighter, Bob cannot himself be moral. The moment *after* Doug steals his lighter, Bob must then steal “his” lighter back – however, it is only “stealing” if the lighter is *not* legitimately Bob’s in the first place. When Doug steals Bob’s lighter, the lighter does not legitimately become Doug’s property, otherwise the concept of theft would make no sense. If, the moment I steal something, it becomes my legitimate property, then restitution would itself become theft. If, however, I do *not* establish legitimate ownership by stealing Bob’s lighter, then clearly it is impossible for Bob to “steal” the lighter *back*, because we cannot steal what we already own, and my theft has not invalidated Bob’s ownership of his lighter.

Thus, if stealing is good, then goodness becomes a state achievable only in the instant that Doug steals Bob’s lighter. In that instant, only Doug can be moral, and Bob cannot be. After that, goodness becomes impossible to achieve for either party, unless Doug keeps giving Bob’s lighter back and then snatching it away again.

Of course, it seems patently ridiculous to imagine that the ideal moral state is for one man to keep giving another man back the property he has stolen, and then immediately stealing it again. Thus logic seems to validate our instinctual understanding of the foolishness of this as a moral ideal – but let’s go a little further, to see if it still holds.

Remember, we are not particularly concerned with individual criminals, but rather with moral theories that justify violations of property rights. For instance, if Doug steals Bob’s lighter because Doug believes that “No property rights are valid,” then Doug’s moral theory instantly self-detonates.

If no property rights are valid, then stealing is a completely illogical action, since stealing is an assertion of the just desire to control property.

Property rights themselves are nothing more than the assertion of a just desire to retain control over assets. It is optional, insofar as you and I can join some hippie commune, and decide to never assert our property rights ever again. Or, if it becomes known in my neighbourhood that I am more than happy if somebody takes my property, it seems somewhat more likely that my lawnmower will go missing. Similarly, if I put a notebook computer on my front lawn with a sign saying “yours if you want it,” then I am clearly signalling that I have no desire to retain current or future control over the notebook.

If Doug steals Bob’s lighter, it is because Doug has a desire to gain control over the lighter – which is the very definition of property rights. If Doug steals Bob’s lighter because Doug believes that property rights are invalid, then what he is really saying is: “I want to gain control over Bob’s lighter because it is never valid to gain control over any object.”

If Doug does steal Bob’s lighter, but then defends his theft through a rejection of property rights, then clearly Doug cannot object to Bob taking his lighter back – since property rights are invalid, Doug now has no more valid claim to own the lighter than Bob did. Finally, if Doug steals Bob’s lighter under the principle “theft is good,” then clearly Doug could have no logical objection to someone else stealing the lighter immediately. However, it would make precious little sense for Doug to spend time and energy stealing Bob’s lighter if the moment he had it in his hot little hands, someone else snatched it away from him. In other words, working to gain control of a piece of property is only valid if you can assert your property rights over the stolen object. No man will bother stealing a wallet if he has certain knowledge that it will be stolen from him the moment he gets his hands on it.

In other words, theft in practice is both an affirmation of property rights and a denial of property rights. Any moral theory that supports theft thus both affirms and denies the existence of property rights – an insurmountable contradiction which completely invalidates any such theory.

If we look at the moral aspects of communism, for instance, property rights are explicitly denied for the individual. However, those individuals who call themselves “the government” do claim the right to control property. What this means in practice is that it is *evil* for some men to control property, but it is *good* for other men to control property. Since there is no biological distinction in terms of species between ruler and ruled, we can clearly see that here, for the same species, we have completely opposite moral rules, which cannot be valid. UPB explicitly demands that moral rules be consistent for all men, in all places, and at all times – saying that it is immoral for Ivan Denisovich to exercise his property rights – but *moral* for Joseph Stalin to exercise *his* property rights – creates a rank contradiction, akin to saying that pouring water into a swimming pool both fills it and empties it at the same time. Any physicist who proposed the latter would be laughed out of his profession – moralists, however, regularly propose the former, and are greeted with mysterious levels of respect.
