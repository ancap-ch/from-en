Drittens, jeder, der staatliche Polizeistationen und Gerichte gesehen hat, ganz zu schweigen von den Gefängnissen, weiß, wie wahr es ist, dass die Produktionsfaktoren die uns eine solche Sicherheit bieten, überstrapaziert, schlecht gepflegt und schmutzig sind. Da niemand, der diese Produktionsfaktoren verwendet, sie tatsächlich besitzt (niemand kann sie verkaufen und sich die Einnahmen aus dem Verkauf privat aneignen) und Verluste (und Gewinne) im Wert des verwendeten Kapitals sozialisiert werden, wird jeder dazu neigen, sein Privatvermögen zu erhöhen, das sich aus der Verwendung der Faktoren auf Kosten von Kapitalwertverlusten ergibt. Daher werden die Grenzkosten zunehmend dazu tendieren, den Wert des Grenzprodukts zu überschreiten, und es wird zu einer Überauslastung des Kapitals kommen. Und wenn dies ausnahmsweise nicht der Fall ist und eine Überauslastung nicht erkennbar sein sollte, dann ist dies nur zu Kosten möglich, die vergleichsweise viel höher sind als bei vergleichbaren privaten Unternehmen.[^26]

Zweifellos würden all diese Probleme, die einem System der monopolistischen Sicherheitsproduktion innewohnen, relativ schnell gelöst werden, sobald eine bestimmte Nachfrage nach Sicherheitsdienstleistungen durch einen Wettbewerbsmarkt, mit einer völlig anderen Anreizstruktur für die Hersteller, befriedigt werden würde. Das soll nicht heißen, dass eine "perfekte" Lösung für das Sicherheitsproblem gefunden werden würde. Es würde immer noch Überfälle und Morde geben; und nicht alle Beute würde wiedergefunden werden, noch alle Mörder würden gefangen werden. Aber in Bezug auf Verbraucherbewertungen würde sich die Situation in dem Maße verbessern, in dem die Natur des Menschen es erlauben würde, sich zu verbessern. Erstens, solange es ein Wettbewerbssystem gibt (d.h. solange die Hersteller von Sicherheitsdiensten von freiwilligen Käufen abhängig sind, von denen die meisten wahrscheinlich die Form von Dienstleistungs- und Versicherungsverträgen annehmen, die vor einem tatsächlichen "Auftreten" von Unsicherheit oder Aggression vereinbart wurden), könnte kein Erzeuger sein Einkommen erhöhen, ohne die von den Verbrauchern wahrgenommenen Leistungen oder die Qualität des Produkts zu verbessern. Darüber hinaus könnten alle Sicherheitsproduzenten zusammengenommen die Bedeutung ihrer jeweiligen Branche nicht stärken, es sei denn, die Verbraucher würden, aus welchen Gründen auch immer, die Sicherheit höher bewerten als andere Waren und somit sicherstellen, dass die Produktion von Sicherheit niemals auf Kosten der Nicht-Sicherheit erfolgt - oder reduzierte Produktion von, sagen wir, Käse als konkurrierendem Privatgut. Hinzu kommt, dass die Hersteller von Sicherheitsdiensten ihre Angebote in erheblichem Maße diversifizieren müssen, da eine stark diversifizierte Nachfrage nach Sicherheitsprodukten bei Millionen und Abermillionen von Verbrauchern besteht. Unmittelbar abhängig von der freiwilligen Unterstützung der Verbraucher würden sie sofort finanziell geschädigt werden, wenn sie nicht angemessen auf die verschiedenen Bedürfnisse der Verbraucher oder ihre Wünsche reagieren würden. Somit hätte jeder Verbraucher einen direkten, wenn auch kleinen Einfluss auf die Produktion von Waren, die auf dem Sicherheitsmarkt erscheinen oder verschwinden. Anstatt ein einheitliches "Sicherheitspaket" für jedermann anzubieten, ein Merkmal der staatlichen Produktionspolitik, würde eine Vielzahl von Dienstleistungspaketen auf dem Markt erscheinen. Sie würden auf die unterschiedlichen Sicherheitsbedürfnisse verschiedener Menschen zugeschnitten sein und unterschiedliche Berufe, unterschiedliches Risikoverhalten, unterschiedliche Schutz- und Versicherungsbedürfnisse sowie unterschiedliche geografische Standorte und zeitliche Beschränkungen berücksichtigen.

Aber das ist bei weitem nicht alles. Neben der Diversifizierung würden sich auch Inhalt und Qualität der Produkte verbessern. Nicht nur würde sich die Behandlung der Verbraucher durch die Mitarbeiter von Sicherheitsunternehmen sofort verbessern, die "Ich-könnte-mich-weniger-scheren", die Willkür und sogar Brutalität, die Nachlässigkeit und Säumigkeit der gegenwärtigen Polizei- und Justizsysteme würden letztendlich verschwinden. Da Polizisten und Richter von freiwilliger Unterstützung durch die Verbraucher abhängig wären, könnten Fälle von Misshandlung von Verbrauchern, Unhöflichkeit oder Unfähigkeit sie ihre Arbeit kosten. Further, the peculiarity that the settlement of disputes between a client and his business partner is invariably entrusted to the latter’s judgment, would almost certainly disappear from the books, and conflict arbitration by independent parties would become the standard offered by producers of security. Most importantly, in order to attract and retain customers the producers of such services would have to offer contracts that would allow the consumer to know what he was buying and enable him to raise a valid, intersubjectively ascertainable complaint if the actual performance of the security producer did not live up to the contract. More specifically, insofar as they are not individualized service contracts where payment is made by a customer to cover his own risks exclusively but are rather insurance contracts that require pooling one’s own risks with those of other people, contrary to the present statist practice these contracts most certainly would no longer contain any deliberately built-in redistributive scheme favoring one group of people at the expense of another. Otherwise, if anyone had the feeling that the contract offered to him required him to pay for other people’s peculiar needs and risks—factors of possible insecurity, that is, that he did not perceive as applicable to his own case—he would simply reject signing it or discontinue his payments.

Yet when all this is said, the question will inevitably surface. “Wouldn’t a competitive system of security production necessarily result in permanent social conflict, in chaos and anarchy?” Several responses can be made to this question. First, it should be noted that such an impression would by no means be in accordance with historical, empirical evidence. Systems of competing courts have existed at various places (e.g., in ancient Ireland or at the time of the Hanseatic League) before the arrival of the modern nation state, and as far as we know they worked well.[^27] Judged by the then existent crime rate (crime per capita), the private police in the so-called Wild West (which incidentally was not as wild as some movies imply) were relatively more successful than today’s state-supported police).[^28] And turning to contemporary experience and examples, millions and millions of international contracts exist even now—contracts of trade and travel—and it certainly seems to be an exaggeration to say, for instance, that there is more fraud, more crime, more breach of contract there than in domestic relations. And this, it should be noted, without there being one big monopolistic security producer and lawmaker. Finally it is not to be forgotten that even now in a great number of countries there are various private security producers alongside the state: private investigators, insurance detectives, and private arbitrators. Their work seems to confirm the thesis that they are more, not less, successful in resolving social conflicts than their public counterparts.

However, this historical evidence is very much subject to dispute, in particular regarding whether any general information can be derived from it. Yet there are systematic reasons, too, why the fear expressed by the question is not well-founded. Paradoxical as it may seem, establishing a competitive system of security producers implies erecting an institutionalized incentive structure to produce an order of law and law-enforcement that embodies the highest possible degree of consensus regarding the question of conflict resolution. Such a structure will tend to generate less rather than more social unrest and conflict than would occur under monopolistic auspices.[^29] In order to understand this paradox, it is necessary to take a closer look at the only typical situation that concerns the skeptic and that allows him to believe in the superior virtue of a monopolistically organized order of security production: when a conflict arises between A and B, both are insured by different companies and the companies cannot come to an immediate agreement regarding the validity of the conflicting claims brought forward by their respective clients. (No problem would exist if such an agreement were reached or if both clients were insured by one and the same company—at least the problem then would not be different in any way from that emerging under a statist monopoly.) Would not such a situation always result in a shoot-out? This is highly unlikely. First, any violent battle between companies would be costly and risky, in particular if these companies had reached a respectable size (which would be important for them to have in order to appear as effective guarantors of security to their prospective clients in the first place). More importantly, under a competitive system with each company dependent on the continuation of voluntary consumer payments, any battle would have to be deliberately supported by each and every client of both companies. If there were only one person who withdrew his payments because he was not convinced a battle was necessary in the particular conflict at hand, there would be immediate economic pressure on the company to look for a peaceful solution to the conflict.[^30] Hence any competitive producer of security would be extremely cautious about engaging in violent measures in order to resolve conflicts. Rather, to the extent that it is peaceful conflict resolution that consumers want, each and every security producer would go to great lengths to provide it to its clients and to establish in advance, for everyone to know, to what arbitration process it would be willing to submit itself and its clients in case of a disagreement over the evaluation of conflicting claims. And as such a scheme could appear to the clients of different firms to be working only if there were agreement among them regarding such arbitrational measures, a system of law governing relations between companies that would be universally acceptable to the clients of all of the competing security producers would naturally evolve. Moreover, the economic pressure to generate rules representing a consensus on how conflicts should be handled is even more farreaching. Under a competitive system, the independent arbitrators who would be entrusted with the task of finding peaceful solutions to conflicts would be dependent on the continued support of the two disputing companies insofar as the companies could and would select different judges if either one of them were sufficiently dissatisfied with the outcome of the arbitration work. Thus, these judges would be under pressure to find solutions to the problems handed over to them that, this time not with respect to the procedural aspects of law but its content, would be acceptable to all of the clients of the firms involved.[^31] Otherwise one or all of the companies might lose customers, thus inducing those firms to turn to different arbitrators the next time they are in need of one.[^32]

But wouldn’t it be possible under a competitive system for a security producing firm to become an outlaw company—a firm, that is, which, supported by its own clients, started aggressing against others? There is certainly no way to deny that this might be possible, though again it must be emphasized that here one is in the realm of empirical social science and no one could know such a thing with certainty. And yet the tacit implication that the possibility that a security firm could become an outlaw company somehow indicates a severe deficiency in the philosophy and economics of a pure capitalist social order is fallacious.[^33]

First, it should be recalled that any social system, a statist-socialist order no less than a pure market economy, is dependent for its continued existence on public opinion and that a given state of public opinion at all times delimits what can or cannot occur as well as what is more or less likely to occur. The current state of public opinion in West Germany, for instance, makes it highly unlikely or even impossible that a statist-socialist system of the current Soviet type could be imposed on the West German public. The lack of public support for such a system would doom it to failure and make it collapse. It is even more unlikely that any attempt to impose a Soviet-type order could ever hope to succeed among Americans, given American public opinion. Hence, in order for us to see the problem of outlaw companies correctly, the above question should be phrased as follows: How likely is it that any such event would occur in a given society with its specific state of public opinion? Formulated in this way, it is clear that the answer would have to be different for different societies. For some, characterized by socialist ideas deeply entrenched in the public, there would be a greater likelihood of the reemergence of aggressor companies, and for other societies there would be a much smaller chance of this happening. But then, would the prospect of a competitive system of security production in any given case be better or worse than that of the continuation of a statist system? Let us look, for instance, at the present-day United States. Assume that by a legislative act the state had abolished its right to provide security with tax funds and a competitive system of security production was introduced. Given the state of public opinion, how likely then would it be that outlaw producers would spring up, and what if they did? Evidently, the answer would depend on the reactions of the public to this changed situation. Thus, the first reply to those challenging the idea of a private market for security would have to be: What about you? What would your reaction be? Does your fear of outlaw companies mean that you would then go out and engage in trade with a security producer that aggressed against other people and their property, and would you continue supporting it if it did? Certainly the critic would be much muted by this counterattack. But more important than this is the systematic challenge implied in this personal counterattack. Evidently, the described change in the situation would imply a change in the cost-benefit structure that everyone would face once he had to make his decisions. Before the introduction of a competitive system of security production, it had been legal to participate in and support (state) aggression. Now such an activity would be illegal. Hence, given one’s conscience, which makes each decision appear more or less costly (i.e., more or less in harmony with one’s own principles of correct behavior), support for a firm engaging in the exploitation of people unwilling to deliberately support its actions would be more costly than before. Given this fact, it must be assumed that the number of people (including even those who otherwise would have readily lent their support to the state) who would now spend their money to support a firm committed to honest business would rise wherever this social experiment was tried. In contrast, the number of people still committed to a policy of exploitation—of gaining at the expense of others—would fall. How drastic this effect would be would of course depend on the state of public opinion. In the example at hand—the United States, where the natural theory of property is extremely widespread and accepted as a private ethic, the libertarian philosophy being essentially the ideology on which the country was founded and that led it to the height it reached[^34]—the effect would naturally be particularly pronounced. Accordingly, security producing firms committed to the philosophy of protecting and enforcing libertarian law would attract the greatest bulk of public support and financial assistance. And while it may be true that some people, and among them especially those who have profited from the old order, might continue their support of a policy of aggression, it is very unlikely that they would be sufficient in number and financial strength to succeed in doing so. Rather, the likely outcome would be that the honest companies would develop the strength needed—alone or in a combined effort and supported in this effort by their own voluntary customers—to check any such emergence of outlaw producers and destroy them wherever and whenever they came into existence.[^35]

> If … the consumer is not free to buy security wherever he pleases, you forthwith see open up a large profession dedicated to arbitrariness and bad management. Justice becomes slow and costly, the police vexatious, individual liberty is no longer respected, the price of security is abusively inflated and inequitably apportioned, according to the power and influence of this or that class of consumers.

[^30]: Contrast this with the state’s policy of engaging in battles without having everyone’s deliberate support because it has the right to tax people; and ask yourself if the risk of war would be lower or higher if one had the right to stop paying taxes as soon as one had the feeling that the states’ handling of foreign affairs was not to one’s liking.

[^35]: Naturally, insurance companies would assume a particularly important role in checking the emergence of outlaw companies. Note Morris and Linda Tannehill (*The Market of Liberty*, pp. 110–11):

> Insurance companies, a very important sector of any totally free economy, would have a special incentive to dissociate themselves from any aggressor and, in addition, to bring all their considerable business influence to bear against him. *Aggressive violence causes value loss*, and the insurance industry would suffer the major cost in most such value losses. An unrestrained aggressor is a walking liability, and no insurance company, however remotely removed from his original aggression, would wish to sustain the risk that he might aggress against one of its own clients next. Besides, aggressors and those who associate with them are more likely to be involved in situations of violence and are, thus, bad insurance risks. An insurance company would probably refuse coverage to such people out of a foresighted desire to minimize any future losses which their aggression might cause. But even if the company were not motivated by such foresight, it would still be forced to rate their premiums up drastically or cancel their coverage altogether in order to avoid carrying the extra risk invoked in their inclination to violence. In a competitive economy, no insurance company could afford to continue covering aggressors and those who had dealings with aggressors and simply pass the cost on to its honest customers; it would soon lose these customers to more reputable firms which could afford to charge less for their insurance coverage.
