# 結論

比較的短期間で、我々は莫大な量の地面をカバーしました。 哲学の最大の課題は、神と国家に依存しない普遍的で客観的で絶対的な道徳の定義です。 我々は神や道徳の定義のための状態に依存している瞬間、道徳はもはや普遍的、客観と絶対的なままです。 つまり、もはや「道徳」ではない。

The invention of imaginary entities such as “God” and “the state” does *nothing* to answer our questions about morality.

我々は完全に神の発明は何もしなかったことを理解-と何もしない-生命の起源、または宇宙についての質問に答えるために。 と言うことは、どんな質問にも答えて、 “いくつかの理解できないいくつかのないの方法でいくつかの想像を絶するものを不可知目的のために、” 合理的な答えの任意の並べ替えを考慮することはできません。

理解不能になることのな危険 “回答” 合理的かつ本質的な質問には、それが提供することです *錯覚* 一般的に真実の追求を否定する答えの。 さらに、グループは必然的にこの不合理な非回答から守ると利益を連結。 これは、宗教の領域、聖職者のカーストです。 In the realm of government, this is the political caste.

本物と本質的な質問が満たされた神秘的な暴力的なとき “答え,” 人間の進歩は、回帰になります。 気象学は生まれる司祭は、雨が来るため、神々 がそれを言う場合に失敗します。 医学の科学は、神から道徳的な罰を考えると病気を開発する失敗します。 物理学は、屋台や星の動きは神の時計仕掛けと見なされます場合に復帰します。

虚偽の答弁は、道徳的な質問に掲載されて、必然的にそれらの答えを質問に、道徳的な犯罪になります。 幻想は、好奇心に置き換えられときに、利益を得るそれらの幻想から必然的に人は彼らの嘘を守るために暴力を使用してが終わる。

And for evermore, *children* are the first victims of these exploitive falsehoods.

子供たちはお菓子を食べて、鬼ごっこ、または 2 つのプラス 2 は 4 であることを理解することにいじめられることにありません。 人間の心は、真実が繰り返し侮辱や退屈、恐怖を与えたことを必要はありません。 A child does not have to be “taught” that a toy is real by telling him that he is damned to hell for eternity if he does not *believe* that the toy is real. A child does not have to be bullied into believing that chocolate tastes good by being told that his taste buds are damned by original sin.

Saying that morality exists because God tells us that it exists is exactly the same as saying that morality does not exist. If you buy an iPod from me on eBay, and I send you an empty box, you will write to me in outrage. If I tell you not to worry, that my invisible friend assures me that there is in fact an iPod in the box, would you be satisfied? Would not my claim that my invisible friend tells me of the iPod’s existence be a certain proof that the iPod did not in fact exist?

If morality is justified according to the authority of a being that does not exist, then morality by definition is not justified. If I write a check that is “certified” by a bank that does not exist, then clearly my check is by definition *invalid*.

The same is true for enforcing morality through the irrational monopoly of “the state.” If we allow the existence of a government – a minority of people who claim the right to initiate the use of force, a right which is specifically denied to everyone else – then any and all moral “rules” enforced by the government are purely subjective, since the government is *by definition* based on a violation of moral rules.

If I say that I need the government to protect my property, but that the government is by definition a group of people who can violate my property rights at will, then I am caught in an insurmountable contradiction. I am saying that my property rights must be defended – and then I create an agency to defend them that can violate them at any time. This is like being so afraid of rape that I hire a bodyguard to protect me from being raped – but in the contract, I allow my bodyguard – and anyone he chooses – to rape me at will.

Because “morality” based on the state and on religion is so irrational and self-contradictory, it *requires* a social agency with a monopoly on the initiation of force to function. Since everyone is just making up “morals” and claiming absolute justification based on imaginary entities, rational negotiation and understanding remain impossible. We do not need a government because people are bad, but rather, because people are irrational, we end up with a government. False moral theories always end up requiring violence to enforce them. Moral theories are not developed in *response* to violence – false moral theories *cause* violence – in fact, *demand* violence.

The moral subjectivism and irrationality involved in answering “What is truth?” with “God,” and “What is morality?” with “government,” is so openly revealed by the framework of UPB that it is hard to imagine that this concept is not more widespread.

One central reason for this is that truly understanding UPB requires the very highest possible mental functioning. It is relatively easy to be rational; it is very difficult to think about the implicit premises of rationality, and all that they entail. It is relatively easy to debate; it is very difficult to tease out all of the implicit assumptions involved in the very act of debating.

It is easy to catch a ball – it is hard to invent the physics that explain motion *universally*.

Thinking *about* thinking is the hardest mental discipline of all.

At the beginning of this book, I talked about a “beast” that terrified and enslaved mankind. This beast is always located on a mountaintop, or in a deep cave. People are afraid of the beast in the world, which is why the beast has never been defeated.

The beast has never been defeated because the beast is an illusion.

The beast cannot be defeated in the world, because the beast is within ourselves.

The collective fantasy that there exists a “null zone,” where morality magically reverses itself, called “the government” is exactly the same as the collective fantasy that there exists a “null zone” called “God” where *reality* reverses itself.

If we define “morality” according to the subjective fantasies of mere mortals, then it will forever remain under the manipulative control of power-hungry tyrants. Since God does not exist, anyone who speaks about morality in relation to God is just making up definitions to serve his own purposes.

Since “the state” does not exist, anyone who speaks about morality in relation to government is just making up definitions to serve his own purposes.

Until we can define an objective and rational morality that is free from the subjective whims of each individual, we will never make the kind of progress that we need to as a species.

Morality, like physics, biology, geology and chemistry, must join the realm of the sciences if we are to flourish – and indeed, perhaps, to survive at all.

However, if we can sustain our courage, it is this discipline alone that can set us, and our children – and all humanity in the future – free from the tyranny of the greatest beast: our own moral illusions.
