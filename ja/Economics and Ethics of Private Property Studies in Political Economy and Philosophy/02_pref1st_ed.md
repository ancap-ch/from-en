## 初版の序文

崩壊の社会主義の全体東欧へのアクセにおける安定的で効率的にイベントを永遠に記憶に残月9日、1989年、ドイツの東西の再会に、移動、喜び、ベルリンの壁—追加-支援と緊急度の学位論文は、私がこれまで持っていたよりも望ます。

Whether the following studies deal with economic topics such as employment, interest, money, banking, business cycles, taxes, public goods, or growth; with philosophical problems as the foundations of knowledge, and of economics and ethics in particular; or the reconstruction and theoretical explanation of historical and sociological phenomena such as exploitation, the rise and fall of civilizations, international politics, war, imperialism, and the role of ideas and ideological movements in the course of social evolution—each ultimately contributes to but one conclusion: The right to private property is an indisputably valid, absolute principle of ethics and the basis for continuous “optimal” economic progress. To rise from the ruins of socialism and overcome the stagnation of the Western welfare states, nothing will suffice but the uncompromising privatization of all socialized, that is, government, property and the establishment of a contractual society based on the recognition of the absoluteness of private property rights.

以下の研究を書いて、私は多くの面で助けを受けました。 Special thanks go to my wife Margaret, who again took on the task of de-Germanizing my English; to Llewellyn H. Rockwell, Jr., president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute, and to Burton S. Blumert, president of the Center for Libertarian Studies, for their continuing support of my work; and to my friend David Gordon, for his numerous invaluable suggestions and comments.

My largest debt is to Ludwig von Mises and Murray N. Rothbard, the twentieth century’s two greatest-though much neglected-economists and social philosophers. While I never met Ludwig von Mises, and indeed had not heard of his name until after his death, I am fortunate to have been closely associated with Murray Rothbard for the past six years, first in New York City, and since 1986 as colleagues at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. 私が彼に借りている知的負債以外にも、言葉は私の個人的な感謝を表すものではありません。 彼の知恵、洞察、優しさ、熱意、そして激しい励ましは、私には永遠のインスピレーションでした。 それゆえ、この巻は献身的であることが彼にはあります。
