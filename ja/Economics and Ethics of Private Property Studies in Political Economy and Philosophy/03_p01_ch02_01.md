## The Economics and Sociology of Taxation

As the title of the chapter indicates, I have set myself two goals. First, I want to explain the general economic effect of taxation. This part of the chapter represents a praxeological analysis of taxation and as such should not be expected to go much beyond what has already been said by other economists.

More originality might be found in the second part, where I will try to answer the question: why is there taxation; and why is there always more of it? そのような質問に答えることは、経済理論の仕事ではなく、知的調査のこの分野から始まる、社会学的または情報に基づく制約的社会学的または歴史的解釈と再建の研究である。

To say there is nothing new to be stated regarding the economic effects of taxation is not to say that what there *is* would not be news to many. 実際、いくつかの一般的な経済学の教科書を調査した結果、私は今日の経済学者と経済学者のほとんどにそのニュースを伝えなければならないように思えます。 Insofar as these texts deal with the economic effects of taxation at all, beyond a purely descriptive presentation of various tax-schemes and their historical development[^1], they are almost completely silent on the question of what the general effects of taxation are. Moreover, what in their discussion of the problem of tax-incidence these texts then say about the economic effects of specific forms of taxation is invariably flawed.

However, this state of affairs merely reflects a process of intellectual degeneration. As early as 150 years ago almost everything that should be understood today about the economics of taxation had been correctly and convincingly stated by such a prominent figure in the history of economics as Jean Baptiste Say in his *Treatise on Political Economy*.

今日の教科書作家とは対照的に、本の建物全体のどの場所にも税議論を割り当てることは、最初から共通の見出しです "富の消費。"

その後、税金を不正に特定し、その税金を買収および生産攻撃と資産罰として説明し、必然的に資産に埋め込まれた富の形成と生活水準の低下を招く。

Notes Say:

> It is a glaring absurdity to pretend, that taxation contributes to national wealth, by engrossing part of the national produce, and enriches the nation by consuming part of its wealth.[^2]
> 
> 課税とは、国産品の一部を、国民の消費と支出を満たす目的で、個人の手から政府のものに移すことです。 税金、寄付、義務、消費税、援助、補助金、補助金、無料の贈り物など、個人のために消費を供給するためには、それが迅速に適切に行われると考えられます。 要するに、それは文字通りの意味での詐欺です。[^3]

このような根本的な洞察は忘れ去られているか、少なくとも今日は明らかになっていないように見えるので、私の最初の課題として、セイの中心的議論とその妥当性についての新たな説明と説明を新たに提示し、 "対策" 彼は、税金は財産と財産の形成を妨げる必要がないことを示していると主張する。 In light of this general explanation, I will then demonstrate the fundamental logical fallacy in the standard textbook analysis of tax-incidence.

That taxation—foremost and above all—is and must be understood as a means for the destruction of property and wealth-formation follows from a simple logical analysis of the meaning of taxation.

課税は、明確な物的資産の非契約的移転の義務です (今日はほとんどが独占的なお金ではありません), その資産を最初に持っていた人またはそれを保有している人を、現在それを保持している他の人に移すことによって、そのようなものから収入を得た人またはグループから移転された価値。 How did these assets come into the hands of their original owners? Ruling out that this was the outcome of another previous act of taxation, and noting that only those assets can be taxed that have not yet been consumed or whose value has not yet been exhausted through acts of consumption (a tax-gatherer does not take away another man’s garbage but rather his still valuable assets!), three and only three possibilities exist: They come into one’s possession either by one’s having perceived certain nature-given goods as scarce and having actively brought them into one’s possession before anyone else had seen and done so; by having produced them by means of one’s labor out of such previously appropriated goods; or through voluntary, contractual acquisition from a previous appropriator or producer. Only through these types of activities is one capable of acquiring and increasing valuable—and hence taxable—assets. 元の支出行為は、誰もが収入を得ることができる源泉とは考えられなかったものに変わります; 価値の低い資産をより高い価値の資産に転換することを目指すには、生産行為が不可欠です; すべての契約上の交換は、価値のある人の手から特定の資産の所有権をより価値のある人に変更してリダイレクトすることに関連しています。

これから、どのような形の課税は、生産からの初めの支出か、契約から得られる収入の減少を意味します。 Since these activities require the employment of scarce means—at least time and the use of one’s body—which could be used for consumption and/or leisure, the opportunity cost of performing them is raised. The marginal utility of appropriating, producing, and contracting is decreased, and the marginal utility of consumption and leisure increased. Accordingly, there will be a tendency to shift out of the former roles and into the latter ones.[^4]

したがって、消費者ではない貴重な資産を生産者から強制的に移転することにより (荷主と請負業者を含む幅広い意味で) それを生産しない人々に課税することによって、生産者の現在の収入および消費電流レベルが低下する。 Moreover, it reduces the present incentive for future production of valuable assets and thereby also lowers future income and the future level of available consumption. 課税は消費を処罰するだけでなく、生産的な努力に影響を与えません。 これは、将来の収入と消費支出を提供する唯一の手段として、そして場合によってはそれを増やすための生産に対する攻撃です。 By lowering the present value associated with future-directed, value-productive efforts, taxation raises the effective rate of time preference, i.e., the rate of originary interest and, accordingly, leads to a shortening of the period of production and provision and so exerts an inexorable influence of pushing mankind into the direction of an existence of living from hand to mouth. Just increase taxation enough, and you will have mankind reduced to the level of barbaric animal beasts.

Straightforward as such reasoning may seem, there are a number of popular objections raised against it. For instance, from the side of economists who falsely conceive of economics as an empirical science that produces nothing but hypothetical explanations which invariably must be tested against empirical evidence in order to be validated (analogous to the situation in the natural sciences), the following argument is frequently heard: Empirically, it has been observed repeatedly that a rise in the level of taxation was actually accompanied by a rise (not a fall) in GNP or other measures of productive output; hence, the above reasoning, however plausible, must be considered empirically invalid. In fact, some empiricists of this sort go even further and make the stronger claim that taxation actually helps increase the standard of living as evidenced by the fact that some countries with once low standards of living and low levels of taxation now enjoy a much greater wealth with much higher taxes.

Both objections are simply confused. Experience cannot beat logic, and interpretations of observational evidence which are not in line with the laws of logical reasoning are no refutation of these but the sign of a muddled mind (or would one accept someone’s observational report that he had seen a bird that was red and non-red all over at the same time as a refutation of the law of contradiction rather than the pronouncement of an idiot?).

As regards the stronger thesis, it is nothing but a beautiful illustration of the ever so attractive *post hoc ergo propter hoc* fallacy. From the fact that the correlated events of high taxation and wealth were to be observed later than those of low taxation and wealth it is inferred that increased taxation increases wealth. Yet to reason in this way is about as convincing as the argument—justly ridiculed by Say—that one can observe rich men consuming more than poor ones; therefore, their high level of consumption must be responsible for the fact that they are rich.[^5] Just as it follows from the meaning of consumption that this is impossible and that, on the contrary, the rich are not rich because of their high level of consumption but because they previously abstained from consumption and engaged instead in value-productive actions, so it follows from the meaning of taxation that mankind cannot have prospered because of higher levels of taxation but despite such a fact.

The weaker thesis—that experience would at least disprove any claim of a relationship between taxation and productive output that was negative by necessity—is also off the mark. The praxeological reasoning presented above does not at all rule out what empiricist economists falsely interpret as a refutation. In this earlier discussion the conclusion had been reached that the effect of taxation is a relative reduction in the production of valuable assets—a reduction, that is, as compared with the level of output that would have been produced had there been no taxation at all or had the level of taxation not been raised. Nothing was said or implied with respect to the absolute level of the output of valuable assets. As a matter of fact, absolute growth of GNP, for instance, is not only compatible with our earlier praxeological analysis, but can even be seen as a perfectly normal phenomenon to the extent that advances in productivity are possible and actually take place. 同じ入力で高生産を生み出す生産技術の向上で可能になると (コスト面で), あるいは、入力が減り、物理的に同一のアウトプットがある場合、増税と貴重な資産の生産の増加との間の偶然性は驚くべきことではありません。 However, this does not in the least affect the validity of what has been stated about relative impoverishment resulting from taxation. 技術的知識の状態では、時間の経過とともに変化する可能性がありますが、課税はそれに相当します (貴重な生産努力のための処罰), 生産的生産の水準は、同じ知識で達成されているかもしれず、税がないか、それ以下でなければならない。 Statistical studies here are entirely beside the point: they can neither help strengthen it, nor can they ever be used to weaken it.

いくつかの人気を誇っているもう一つの理論的異論は、課税を課すことは、課税対象資産に由来する所得の減少につながるということです。 この減少は、他の形態の活動から得られたものと比較して、そのような資産の限界効用を上げることに関連する。 したがって、それを下げるのではなく、実際に生産に参加する税制の傾向を高めます。 For the usual case of taxing money assets this is to say that taxes reduce monetary income which raises the marginal utility of money, and this in turn increases the incentive to attain monetary returns. This argument, to be sure, is perfectly true as far as it goes. However, it is a misconception to believe that it does anything to invalidate the relative impoverishment thesis that I have advanced. まず第一に、たとえそれが真実であっても、示唆された議論が、それが間違っていると示唆しているように、増加した課税では、労働集約主義に比例しています。 貴重な生産者からの収入は依然として減少しています。 Even if they produce the same output as previously, they can only do so if they expend more labor now than before. Since any additional labor expenditure implies forgone leisure or consumption (leisure or consumption which they otherwise could have enjoyed along with the same output of valuable assets), their overall standard of living must be lower.[^6]

It now becomes apparent why the assumption that taxation can leave the productive output of valuable assets unaffected and exclusively cripple consumption is fatally flawed. 税収が減ったとき (消費と余暇に由来するものを含む), ヒューマンアクターは、常に、将来の商品よりも現在の商品を好む普遍的な時間優先の事実を与えられている (継続的な消費なしに行うことはできず、消費財の形態が対応する待機期間中に提供される場合に限り、より長くより包括的な生産方法に従事することができる), それは必然的に、あなたがこの行動を実行することによって、人の有効な時間優先度を上げなければならないことを必然的に意味します (待ち時間の無駄を増やさなければならない), 彼が他に選択しただろうと比較して、彼は生産構造の長さを短くしなければならない。 Accordingly, his output of valuable assets available at future dates will have to be lower than would be the case otherwise. If with lower or no taxation his income had been higher and his time preference schedule being given (whatever it happens to be at any particular point in time), he would have invested in lengthier production processes. As a consequence, his output of valuable future assets would have been relatively greater.[^7]

The error in the thesis that taxation can have a neutral effect on production lies in the fact that time preference is not taken into account. The argument presently under scrutiny is quite correct in pointing out that taxation implies a twofold signal: on the one hand the substitution effect working in favor of consumption and leisure and against work; and on the other hand the income effect of raising the marginal utility of the taxed asset. However, it is false to interpret this simplistically as a mixed bag of contradictory signals—one in favor of and one against work—so that one can then state nothing of a categorical nature regarding the effects of taxation on production, and the question of whether or not taxation provides for a lower or a higher output of valuable assets must be conceived of as an entirely empirical one.[^8] For in fact, the signal of taxation is not contradictory at all once it has been recognized that it is being sent to persons whose actions are invariably constrained by time preference. For such actors there exists not only the alternative between work and no work at all but also one between producing a valuable asset in more or less time-consuming ways. 常に資産を迅速かつ直接的に取得するか、待ち時間はほとんどありませんが、非効率的な生産方法に頼らざるを得ません (彼の素手で魚を捕まえてより多くのロータリー生産方法を使用するより早くそれを得ることを決めた有名な漁師), あなたはより生産的な方法でそれを得ることができますが、果物を放出するためには長い間待たなければなりません (より高い将来の返品によって誘惑される漁民は、より長い待機期間に耐え、ネットを最初に構築することを決定する)。 しかし、これらの選択肢を前提とすると、課税のメッセージが完全にはっきりしていないこと、および所得効果を体系的に支配するために代理効果を考慮しなければならないという問題はもはや存在しない: 何かを持っているかしていないかという選択肢があることに加えて、遅かれ早かれ何もない場合、課税された二重メッセージは容易に統合されて1つに変換されます: 待ち時間を短縮する; ロータリー生産の方法を短縮してください！ By doing so, valuable assets will be obtained earlier—in line with their increased marginal utility. Simultaneously, in shortening the waiting period, more room will be given for leisure—in line with its increased marginal utility. By reducing the length of roundabout methods of production the two seemingly contradictory signals stemming from taxation are simultaneously accounted for. Contrary to any claim of a systematically “neutral” effect of taxation on production, the consequence of any such shortening of roundabout methods of production is a lower output produced. 常に税金を支払わなければならない価格は、すべての税金の増加に対して生産性を強制的に低下させ、将来の消費に備えて提供される貴重な資産に関して生活水準を低下させます。 Every act of taxation necessarily exerts a push away from more highly capitalized, more productive production processes in the direction of a hand-to-mouth-existence.

[^7]: One might object here that the tax receipts will come into someone’s hands—those of government officials or of governmental transfer-paymentrecipients—and that their increased income, resulting in a lower effective time preference rate for them, may offset the increase in this rate on the taxpayers’ side and hence leave the overall rate and the structure of production unchanged. Such reasoning, however, is categorically flawed: For one thing, insofar as government expenditure is concerned, it cannot be regarded as investment at all. Rather, it is consumption, and consumption alone. For, as Rothbard has explained,

> [i]n any sort of division-of-labor economy, capital goods are built, not for their own sake by the investor, but in order to use them to produce lower-order and eventually consumers’ goods. In short, a characteristic of an investment expenditure is that the good in question is not being used to fulfill the needs of the investor, but of someone else—the consumer. Yet, when government confiscates resources from the private market economy, it is precisely defying the wishes of the consumers; when government invests in any good, it does so to serve the whims of government officials, not the desires of consumers. (*Man, Economy, and State*, pp. 816–17)

Thus, government expenditure, by definition, cannot be conceived of as lengthening the production structure and hence as counterbalancing the taxpayers’ raised time preference rate.—On the other hand,

> as for the *transfer* expenditures made by the government (including the salaries of bureaucrats and subsidies to privileged groups), it is true that some of this will be saved and invested. These investments, however, will not represent the voluntary desires of consumers, but rather investments in fields of production *not* desired by the *producing* consumers…. Once let the tax be eliminated, and … the new investments called forth by the demands of the specially privileged will turn out to be *malinvestments*. (*Power and Market*, p. 98)

Consequently, transfer expenditures also cannot be conceived of as compensating for the fact that taxpayers shorten the length of the production structure. All such expenditures can do is to lengthen the structure of mal-production. “At any rate” concludes Rothbard,

> the amount consumed by the government insures that the effect of income taxation will be to raise time-preference ratios and to reduce saving and investment. (Ibid., p. 98)
