## Teoría del empleo, el dinero, el interés y el proceso capitalista: el caso misesiano contra Keynes

Mi objetivo es reconstruir algunas verdades básicas sobre el proceso de desarrollo económico y el papel que desempeñan en él el empleo, el dinero y el interés. Estas verdades no se originaron con la Escuela Austriaca de economía, ni son parte integral de esta tradición de pensamiento económico solo. De hecho, la mayoría de ellos formaban parte de lo que hoy se llama economía clásica, y fue el reconocimiento de su validez lo que distinguió al economista del chiflado. Sin embargo, la Escuela Austriaca, en particular Ludwig von Mises y, más tarde, Murray N. Rothbard, han dado la presentación más clara y completa de estas verdades. <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref"> 1 </ 0> Además, también han presentado su defensa más rigurosa que la última instancia, son deducibles de proposiciones básicas e incontestables (historias como las que el hombre actúa y sabe lo que significa actuar). decisivo, equivaldría a contradicciones y absurdos lógico-praxeológicos. 2</p> 

<p>
  First, I will systematically reconstruct this Austrian theory of economic development. Then I will turn to the “new” theory of Keynes, which belongs, as he himself cannot help but acknowledge, to the tradition of “underworld” economics (like Mercantilism) and of economic cranks (like Silvio Gesell).<fnref target="3" /> I will show that Keynes’s new economics, too, is cranky: a tissue of logical-praxeological falsehoods reached by means of obscure jargon, shifting definitions, and logical inconsistencies, intent to create an anticapitalist, anti-private-property, and antibourgeois mentality.

<h4>
  Employment
</h4>

<p>
  “Unemployment in the unhampered market is always voluntary.”<fnref target="4" /> Man works, because he prefers its anticipated result to the disutility of labor and the psychic income to be derived from leisure. He “stops working at that point, at which he begins to value leisure, the absence of labor’s disutility, more highly than the increment in satisfaction expected from working more.”<fnref target="5" /> Obviously, then, Robinson Crusoe, the self-sufficient producer, can only be unemployed voluntarily (because he prefers to remain idle and consume present values instead of expending additional labor in the production of future ones).
</p>

<p>
  The result is not different when Friday enters and a private property economy is established based on a initial recognition of each person’s rights of exclusive ownership over those resources which he had recognized as scarce and appropriated (homesteaded) by mixing his labor with them before anyone else had done so, and of all goods produced with their help. In this situation not only exchange ratios—prices—for the purchase or rental of material goods become possible, but also prices (wages) for the rental of labor services. Employment will ensue whenever the offered wage is valued more highly by the laborer than the satisfaction to be derived from self sufficiently working with and/or consuming his own resources (or of appropriating previously submarginal resources). Employment will increase, and wages rise, so long as entrepreneurs perceive existing wages as lower than the marginal value product (discounted by time preference)<fnref target="6" /> which a corresponding increment in the employment of labor can be expected to bring about. On the other hand, unemployment will result, and increase, so long as a person values the marginal value product attained through self-employment more highly than a wage that reflects his labor services’ marginal productivity.
</p>

<p>
  In this construction there is no logical room for such a thing as involuntary unemployment. As employment is always voluntary, so is unemployment (self-employment).<fnref target="7" />
</p>

<p>
  Involuntary unemployment is only logically possible once the situation is fundamentally changed and a person or institution is introduced which can successfully exercise control over resources which he has not homesteaded, or acquired through voluntary exchange from homesteaders. Such an extra-market institution, by imposing, for instance, a minimum wage higher than the marginal productivity of labor, can effectively prohibit an exchange between a supplier of labor service and a capitalist which would be preferred by both, if both had unrestricted control over their homesteaded property. The would-be laborer then becomes involuntarily unemployed, and the would-be employer is forced to dislocate complementary factors of production from more into less value productive usages. As a matter of fact, an extra-market institution can in principle create any desired amount of involuntary unemployment. A minimum wage of say, $1 million per hour would, if enforced, involuntarily disemploy practically everyone and would, along this way toward forced self-employment, condemn most of today’s population to death by starvation.
</p>

<p>
  In the absence of an institution exempt from the rules of the market involuntary unemployment is logically impossible, and prosperity instead of impoverishment will result.
</p>

<h4>
  Money
</h4>

<p>
  Man participates in an exchange economy (instead of remaining in self-sufficient isolation) insofar as he is capable of recognizing the higher productivity of a system of the division of labor and he prefers more goods over less. Out of his market participation arises in turn his desire for a medium of exchange (money). Indeed, only if one were to assume the humanly impossible (that man had perfect foresight regarding the future), would there be no purpose for him to have money. For with all uncertainties removed, in the never-never land of equilibrium one would know precisely the terms, times, and locations of all future exchanges, and everything could be prearranged accordingly and would take on the form of direct rather than indirect exchanges.<fnref target="8" /> Under the inescapable human condition of uncertainty, however, when all this is not known and action must by nature be speculative, man will begin to demand goods no longer exclusively because of their use-value, but also because of their value as media of exchange.
</p>

<p>
  Faced with a situation where his reservation demand for some supplied goods or services is low or nonexistent, and where a directly satisfying exchange, due to the absence of double coincidences of wants, is out of the question, he will also consider trading whenever the goods to be acquired are more marketable than those to be surrendered, such that their possession would then facilitate the acquisition of directly serviceable goods and services at not yet known future dates.
</p>

<p>
  Moreover, since it is the very function of a medium of exchange to facilitate future purchases of directly serviceable goods, man will naturally prefer the acquisition of a more marketable and, at the limit, universally marketable medium of exchange to that of a less or nonuniversally marketable one so that
</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>
    there would be an inevitable tendency for the less marketable of the series of goods used as media of exchange to be one by one rejected until at last only a single commodity remained, which was universally employed as a medium of exchange; in a word, money.<fnref target="9" />
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>
  On the way toward this ultimate goal, by selecting monies that are increasingly more widely used, the division of labor is extended and productivity increased.
</p>

<p>
  However, once a commodity has been established as a universal medium of exchange, and the prices of all directly serviceable exchange goods are expressed in terms of units of this money (while the price of the money unit is its power to purchase an array of nonmoney goods), money no longer exercises any systematic influence on the division of labor, employment, and produced income. Once established, any amount of money is compatible with any amount of employment and income.<fnref target="10" /> Indeed, as explained above, in the nevernever land of equilibrium there would be no money, but there would still be employment and income. This demonstrates that money on the one hand and employment and income on the other must be regarded as logically-praxeologically independent and unrelated concepts. For instance, should the supply of money increase, other things being equal, this would surely have redistributive effects, depending on where and how the additional money entered the economy; but it would just as surely have no systematic effect on the amount of employment and the size of the social product. Prices and wages generally would go up, and the purchasing power of the money unit would go down. However, nothing would follow with regard to employment and social product. They may be different, or they may be the same. The same is true of changes in the demand for money. An increase in the demand for money (i.e., a higher relative value attached to additional cash as compared to additional nonmoney), would certainly change relative prices; yet it would not imply anything as far as employment and social product is concerned. In equilibrating an increased demand for money with a given stock of money, the general level of prices and wages must fall, and the purchasing power of the money unit must rise, <em>mutatis mutandis</em>. But there is no reason to suppose that this should have any impact on employment or income. Money wages fall, but simultaneously the purchasing power of money increases, leaving real wages and real social product entirely unaffected.
</p>

<p>
  The result is no different if changes on the nonmoney side are considered. Other things being equal, an increase in the supply of goods and services, for instance, brings about an increase in the purchasing power of money; money prices fall. This reduces the quantity of money demanded (the demand schedule for money being given), because the cost of holding onto money instead of spending it on non-money has risen; and this lowered demand for cash implies in turn a reverse tendency toward rising prices and a reduced purchasing power of money. Nothing concerning employment and social product follows. Nor does the picture change when expectations are explicitly taken into account. Inflationary (deflationary) expectations reduce (increase) the demand for money immediately and thus speed up the adjustment toward whatever has been anticipated; and if something wrong has been anticipated (i.e., something out of line with the underlying reality), then the process of self-corrective adjustments is sped up through the workings of expectations. But none of these monetary phenomena has any systematic praxeological connection with employment and social product, which may well remain the same throughout all monetary changes.
</p>

<p>
  Invariably, money is “neutral” to employment and social product.

      The claim that involuntary unemployment is possible in the framework of a private property economy as characterized above is due to an elementary logical-conceptual confusion: It ignores the fact that employment is a two-party affair; i.e., an exchange which, like any voluntary exchange, can only take place if it is deemed <em>mutually</em>, <em>bilaterally</em> beneficial. It makes no more sense to classify someone as involuntarily unemployed if he cannot find anybody willing to meet his unilaterally fixed demands for employment, than to call a person in search of a wife, a house, or a Mercedes involuntarily wifeless, homeless, or Mercedesless because no one wants to marry him or supply him with a house or a Mercedes <em>at terms which this person has unilaterally determined as agreeable to him.</em> Absurdity and contradiction would result if one were to do so. For then one would not only have to accept, as the other side of the same coin, that the boycotting employer, woman, or owner of a house or a Mercedes in turn would have to be regarded as an involuntary <em>non</em>employer, <em>non</em>wife, or <em>non</em>trader of a house or a Mercedes <em>because his/her unilateral demands had not been met by the wouldbe employee, would-be husband, or would-be house or Mercedes owner just as much as they had not met his</em>. Moreover, with both the would-be employee as well as the would-be employer classified as involuntarily being what they are because no mutual agreement had been reached between them, to create “voluntary employment” would imply coercing either one or both parties to accept an exchange whose terms one or both of them regard as unacceptable. Hence, to say involuntary unemployment is possible on the unhampered market is to say coercion means voluntariness and voluntariness coercion, which is nonsense.

        Goods are useful and scarce, and any increment in goods is a social benefit. But money is useful not directly, but only in exchanges…. When there is less money, the exchange-value of the monetary unit rises; when there is more money, the exchange-value of the monetary unit falls. We conclude that there is no such thing as “too little” or “too much” money, <em>that, whatever the social money stock, the benefits of money are always utilized to the maximum extent</em>. (p. 670)
